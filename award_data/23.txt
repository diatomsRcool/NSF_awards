This nine-week summer program will expose eight qualified undergraduate students and a K-12 teacher to advanced topics in mathematics, problem-solving techniques and multidisciplinary applications. This summer research program will provide the participants with a unique experience of how mathematics can be applied to understand the qualitative and quantitative behavior of biological, bio-inspired and engineering systems. Selected problems range from Reconstruction of protein networks and Aneurysm mechanics to Modeling of Micro Air Vehicles, Neuronal field models, Porous substrates and Materials engineering applications. Through these research problems, we hope to encourage students and teachers to learn by discovery and enhance their understanding of the multidisciplinary role of mathematics in engineering, science and medicine. This nine-week summer program will also include the following activities: lecture series on topics; graduate mentoring club; guest colloquiums; student seminars; computational laboratory and; scientific & social tours. The REU site will involve eight qualified faculty who have excelled in their research accomplishments, have guided graduate and undergraduate research, and have been involved in K-12 outreach activities. The site will also involve two graduate students each year who will serve as mentors for the participants.<br/><br/>The multi-disciplinary research program will greatly enhance the awareness of the ever-increasing utility of mathematical and computational approaches in understanding biological, bio-inspired and engineering systems; contribute to the scientific development of undergraduate students and K-12 teachers and; will nurture the intellectual growth and development of graduate students providing them with a valuable experience of mentoring.  This program will also integrate and complement the existing Undergraduate Research in Computational Mathematics program at George Mason University which is an NSF funded CSUMS program. The symbiotic relationship between the existing CSUMS and the REU program will provide opportunities for targeted students to prepare for success in the mathematical and engineering fields and assist them from college to graduate school. The REU program will provide a valuable experience to two K-12 teachers in problem-solving and open-ended exploration in high-school mathematics classrooms. This program will also greatly encourage women and underrepresented minorities to pursue multidisciplinary careers that bridge mathematical, computational and biological sciences.<br/><br/>This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program."

However, there exists a critical need for the preservation and management of skeletal remains of deceased mountain gorillas from this population.  Research on these remains will contribute significant insight into the biology of these critically endangered great apes.  The availability of behavioral and veterinary records associated with each of the skeletons greatly enhances the uniqueness of this resource for scientific discovery.  The major objectives of this project are to recover skeletons from approximately 100 mountain gorillas of known identity, many of which were previously buried, and to provide training and help build local capacity for their curation, long-term preservation and management as a resource for research and education in Rwanda.  An international team of scientists and Rwandan wildlife authorities will carry out this multidisciplinary effort, which includes: location and excavation (where necessary) of recent mountain gorilla skeletal remains; cleaning and preservation of these remains, skeletal curation at the Musée d'Histoire Naturelle in Kigali; and online data-basing of the collection and associated data.  Individual skeletal identities will be confirmed using DNA analysis, where necessary. Project personnel will work closely with Rwandan staff, to build local expertise in skeletal preparation, curation, conservation and management practices, and implement post-necropsy protocols for preservation of future remains. This project will yield significant broader impacts for the scientific community and society at large. This unique skeletal collection will serve as a resource for local and visiting students and scientists alike, interested in all aspects of gorilla biology. Of note, this resource will be the focus of collaborative research between Rwandan and US-based scientists, to examine the effects of disease, environmental factors such as human disturbance, and stress on skeletal tissue growth, development, lifetime health and well-being of mountain gorillas. The educational potential is also profoundly important; this resource will play a key role in disseminating knowledge and enhancing public understanding of Rwanda's wildlife and other natural resources, and building community support for conservation initiatives."

PSI is the primary macromolecular system in plants and photosynthetic bacteria for the conversion of sun light to useable energy.  The main goal of the project will be to understand the fundamental mechanisms of electron transfer to and from immobilized PSI monolayer and multilayer films during the photosynthesis.  With this award, methods will be developed to study higher order oriented multilayer structures of PSI with that mimic larger scale biological structures.  The deposited films of PSI will be linked through molecular wires for better connectivity and electron conductivity. The following studies will be carried out with this project: 1) attachment of PSI to gold electrodes that are used as molecular wires; 2) optimization of the photoconversion efficiency for PSI monolayers by electrochemical catalysis; 3) functional imaging of PSI by scanning electrochemical microscopy; and 4) study the mechanism of functional multilayer structures that mimic the larger scale biological structures like the thylakoid membranes.  The proposed studies are expected to integrate functional biological systems with molecular and mesoscale materials through ?bottom-up? processing, while maintaining the function of the PSI system.  The biomimetic approaches proposed could result in converting sunlight to be a potential useable source of energy.<br/><br/>The proposed project is expected to enhance the fundamental understanding of the interface between biological structures and well-controlled, model organic materials. New covalent and biomimetic attachments, along with 2-D crystals and strategies will be investigated and their effects measured through electrochemical procedures. This multidisciplinary research team consists of chemical and biomolecular engineers and chemists from Vanderbilt University and Tennessee State University, the largest HBCU in Tennessee. In addition, a large number of graduate and undergraduate students from these institutions will be trained by the research team.  Participation of high school teachers and students in the research activities through different programs such as NSF-funded Research Experiences for Teachers and Vanderbilt Summer Academy is another aspect of the project.<br/>"

Fairbanks <br/>A Social-Ecological System (SES) is broadly defined as a system with interacting and interdependent physical, biological and social components, with a special emphasis on human interactions with nature.  As the world?s climate changes, and these intensifying changes increasingly hold ramifications for human populations, the need for concerted analysis of social-ecological systems (SES) is intensified.  Such dynamics are especially pronounced in Alaska, but are also present throughout the United States as population shifts and climate changes combine to produce changes in the intricate web of relationships that link human and natural systems. <br/><br/>The increasing urgency of the situation calls for a sharper focus on the methods and means of integrating biological, physical, and social sciences into SES models.  The Alaska EPSCoR Social-Ecological Systems Workshop will provide an ideal platform from which to accomplish this.  The goals of the SES workshop, to be held in Anchorage in May, 2009, are to enable information-sharing across EPSCoR jurisdictions about SES issues, including both policy and research matters; to identify areas for cross-jurisdictional SES research projects, which will improve funding competitiveness; and to consider collaboration and outreach strategies among researchers, policy-makers, and managers.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Workshop speakers will discourse on emerging scientific innovations in social-ecological systems, highlighting new research tools available in the field. As SES is still an emergent field, the workshop will potentially have a transformative effect on SES study.  The workshop is specifically designed to build collaborations among NSF EPSCoR researchers and jurisdictions, thereby strengthening the nation?s research capacity.<br/><br/>Broader impact: SES study is by its nature interdisciplinary, and the workshop will include researchers from across the scientific spectrum. It will also heavily involve the policy and management side of SES study, potentially impacting not just how SES researchers proceed but how their findings are utilized and implemented.  Speakers will highlight opportunities for STEM educational outreach and workforce development through community-based research. In its study of specific populations SES is inherently concerned with diversity issues, and the workshop will deal with diversity in this sense as well as by tackling the issue of increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in SES research. <br/>"

Because of their compatibility with existing semiconductor device processing methods and the possibility to control their electronic properties via such mechanisms as diameter selection, doping and heterostructure creation, they hold great promise as active elements in future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Significant industrial efforts focus on aspects of nanowire electronics such as integration and device performance. Critical to the success of these efforts is a fundamental understanding of the crystal growth processes involved in nanowire creation. In this Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project, real-time transmission electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the mechanisms of semiconductor nanowire growth. The research aims to quantify growth kinetics relevant to the creation of advance device geometries, with a focus on heterostructures creation, interface abruptness and dopant effects. It seeks to provide fundamental insight into the semiconductor nanowire growth process via the technologically important vapor-liquid-solid and vapor-solid-solid growth processes. These insights are expected to lead to improved understanding of the self-assembly process and will provide a much needed scientific underpinning to the development of nanowire integration methodologies.<br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. Nanoscale electronic devices offer the potential of allowing advances beyond the limits imposed by traditional lithographic fabrication methods. Graduate and postgraduate training forms a core activity of the project, with a program encompassing extensive lab experience at the world's leading industrial lab for basic research in semiconductor electronics. Additionally, in-situ transmission electron microscopy is one of the primary ""eyes"" into nanoscale behavior, allowing exciting, dynamic videos of real physical processes to be obtained. The PI will continue work with a scientific visualization company to develop realistic and scientifically accurate animations of nanowire growth. These animations will be used to describe the science of nanotechnology to a broad audience through multiple dissemination routes, and will be utilized along with real dynamic observations in a web-based class on Thin Film Deposition coordinated through Purdue's NSF sponsored NanoHUB."

The vapor-phase growth of multi-component, uniform- and tapered-diameter nanowires of group III-V semiconducting materials uses the technique of metallorganic chemical vapor disposition. The structural, electronic, and optical properties of the nanowires are investigated using high-resolution electron microscopy, optical excitation spectroscopies, resonant Raman scattering, and proximal characterization methods. These studies are to elucidate how topological driven strain, surface and interface structure, and band structure, and band bending influence the presence and properties of collective electronic excitation within semiconductor heterostructure materials systems. The research projects are carried out collaboratively among students and faculty at Drexel University and industrial scientists at Structured Materials Industries, Inc. (SMI). The research goal of this project is to understand how multi-component group III-V based semiconductor nanowire materials can be grown and processed in a manner that they enable confinement and control of charge-density waves for the purpose of tunable, resonant terahertz detection and emission. <br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The fabrication of semiconductor nanowires and study of their collective electronic excitations and their response to electromagnetic waves would lead to applications in advancing the state-of-the-art in the fast and sensitive detection of terahertz and charged-particle radiation. This GOALI project provides opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to receive training and accrue experience over extended stays in an industrial setting in areas highly relevant to their research and career interests. The project will also include international collaboration with scientists in Italy."

The first consists of absolute measurements of the photoionization cross-section of the 4D5/2 excited state of laser-cooled rubidium atoms. Photoionization studies are relevant for sensitive and state-selective detection of trapped atomic and molecular species, as well as for plasma research, including ultracold plasma formation. Excited D states are of particular interest for fundamental tests of atomic theory. Rubidium atoms cooled and trapped in a standard magneto-optical trap will be subsequently excited to the 4D5/2 state via a two-step process and subjected to the photoionizing laser. The photoionization rate will be measured versus several ionizing laser intensities and several wavelengths below the photoionization wavelength from which relative photoionization cross sections will be determined. The photoionization measurements will be subsequently put on an absolute scale by performing accurate measurements of the excited state fraction using a charge transfer technique. The experimental results will be compared for consistency with theoretical calculations. The second project involves theoretical and experimental studies of the 5S1/2-5D5/2 two-photon degenerate four-wave mixing in a rubidium vapor cell. Degenerate four-wave mixing is a high resolution spectroscopy technique which can be used to investigate phenomena such as optical pumping, relaxation, diffusion, collision and quenching processes. Potential applications include phase corrections of aberrant optical wave fronts, optical computing, image processing, pattern recognition and others. The two-photon degenerate four-wave mixing signal will be investigated versus the angle between the probe and the forward pump beams for several rubidium vapor cells mixed with helium buffer gas at various pressures. The experimental results will be used in conjunction with a newly developed theoretical model to obtain numerical values for the 5D5/2 excited state diffusion coefficient.<br/><br/>Traditionally, participation of Mississippi?s population in science and engineering has been low. Laser cooling and trapping is one of the most active areas in atomic physics research, and such studies are not performed anywhere else in the states of Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. The University of Southern Mississippi has a student population that is 25% African-American and 58% female, which makes the university uniquely positioned to make a difference for women students and, specifically, for minority women in science and engineering. The broader impact of the research is reflected in providing undergraduate and graduate students with experimental research opportunities at the forefront of atomic physics, which in turn, will improve science education. In addition, the research will facilitate extensive involvement in high school outreach and recruitment.<br/>"

The transition from advanced graduate work to the early years of an academic position.<br/>This proposal strives to identify key transition points and to exploit previous successes in providing mentoring at these key points. The results of these efforts have been widely advertised and disseminated in the past, and the plan for future dissemination is sound. In particular, several of these programs seem like they could be adapted at other institutions; the idea of forging partnerships between four-year colleges and research universities is an obvious one, but one that has not been sufficiently explored elsewhere. The programs outlined in this proposal offer clear guidance to institutions considering such partnerships. Combine this role as a resource with the inclusion of pre-grads from institutions other than UNL, the nationwide recruitment in UNL?s Intensive Mathematics: A Mentoring, Education, and Research Experience, and the broad participation of undergraduate women in the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics, and the breadth of the impact of this proposal is clear.<br/><br/>This project is being co-funded by DMS and EPSCoR.<br/><br/><br/>"

This study addresses three questions that are paramount to developing this framework. (1) How do traits related to tree form (e.g., allometries, morphology) and function (e.g., physiology, growth, allocation, survival) vary between species, and how do evolutionary versus environmental drivers affect trait variability?<br/>(2) Is a species-specific representation of form and function necessary to accurately describe community and ecosystem properties (e.g., diversity, succession, productivity, carbon cycling)? (3) How do we develop a general scaling framework for predicting large-scale forest dynamics that includes species-specific trait variability and key physiological mechanisms? Towards addressing these questions, this study develops and applies data-model integration methodologies, including: (i) dynamic process models that link tree form and function, incorporate key plant functional traits, and are applicable to broad spatial and temporal scales; (ii) new meta-analysis methods for analyzing vast amounts of literature information on species-specific traits that incorporate phylogenetic relationships and overcome limitations common to ³classical² meta-analytic approaches; and<br/>(iii) rigorous statistical and computational methods for informing the process model with large and disparate data sources (i.e., literature, forest inventory, and tree-ring width databases). This highly integrative approach will provide a major step towards building and testing a general scaling framework. <br/> <br/>The broader impacts of this work include multiple training opportunities in data-model integration methods for undergraduates through post-graduate scientists. Methods developed in this study will be partly disseminated through an annual, daylong workshop on Bayesian analysis in ecology for the Ecological Society of America annual meetings.

Training in modern statistical modeling will offer a unique educational opportunity for those PhD students in UW¹s new and vibrant graduate Program in Ecology. This study will also create independent research opportunities for UW undergraduates, and it will provide one post-doctoral and two PhD students with unique interdisciplinary teaching, mentoring, and research training in ecology, statistics, mathematics, and computational science.<br/>"

This project focuses on using surface properties to aid low-solubility dopant atoms in finding the desired place in the host crystal lattice. The specific material system studied in this project is Mn-doped GaAs, which has potential for spintronics applications. The experiments include growth of semiconductor materials using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and surface diffusion studies using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The central idea of project is to utilize the various configurations of GaAs(001) surface to find a natural way for Mn dopant atoms added to the surface to end up in substitutional positions in favor of interstitial positions. Surfaces, unlike the bulk, offer a rich variety of stable configurations and each one can be independently formed across the entire surface thereby providing many unique and chemically varied templates for aiding the doping process during layer-by-layer growth. Specifically, some surfaces are arsenic rich, some are gallium rich, some have a symmetric geometry, some have an asymmetric geometry, some are free of edge sites and others a full of edge sites, and so on. In order to fully understand the non-equilibrium (kinetic) doping process at the atomic-scale, this project aims to study the entire pathways of the dopant atom from initial deposition onto a surface to its final bulk bonding site. In doing this, the doping processes will be uncovered and quantified via the diffusion coefficients, energy barriers, diffusion anisotropies, and the sticking anisotropies. <br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance.

Despite this effort, much uncertainty remains, especially with regard to gaseous nitrogen losses. This is particularly troubling in the context of human modification of the nitrogen cycle, which is dramatically increasing nitrogen pollution, runoff, and the emission of nitrous oxide, a radiatively important greenhouse gas. This research will contribute to our understanding of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle by quantifying the role of ""Feammox"", a newly discovered pathway in the global nitrogen cycle. Feammox is the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium coupled to ferric iron [Fe (III)] reduction. It has the potential to produce inert dinitrogen gas as well as reactive nitrite, which could subsequently be reduced to gaseous or organic nitrogen, or ammonium under anaerobic conditions. Given the potential gaseous loss of nitrogen from terrestrial environments, this pathway may play a significant role in the global nitrogen cycle. The proposed research will place this newly discovered nitrogen transformation pathway in the context of the larger nitrogen cycle by (i) determining if Feammox is mediated by soil microbes, and if so identify the responsible organisms, (ii) determining the relative importance of iron- and nitrogen-containing compounds as controls on Feammox, and (iii) quantifying the role of Feammox in total nitrogen gas emissions from soils. <br/><br/>The collaborative research between a soil biogeochemistry laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley and a microbial biogeochemistry laboratory at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln will improve the mechanistic understanding of terrestrial nitrogen cycling. Field work will take place at the Luquillo Long Term Ecological Research site in Puerto Rico. The research addresses a previously unquantified pathway in terrestrial ecosystems that not only has implications for nutrient retention in soils, but could also evolve nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas implicated in global change. This project will support for an early career female scientist, two graduate students, one undergraduate student, and one postdoctoral researcher.

Semiconductor technology lies at the heart of the revolution in computing, communications, consumer electronics, transportation and health care. In the last decade, diversified demand from consumers has been pushing semiconductor industry to produce many differentiated products. As a result, multi-product-multi-tool ('high-mix') manufacturing has become increasingly the standard manufacturing model, which poses many challenges that the current APC framework cannot address. The PIs plan research in the fields of run-to-run (RtR) control, control performance assessment (CPA) and statistical process monitoring (SPM) to meet the emerging needs in high-mix production. <br/>Intellectual Merit: The research will create a non-threaded paradigm for high-mix semiconductor manufacturing by breaking from the current tradition of threaded APC, and provide new theories and techniques to address the challenges posed by high-mix production. By sharing information among different threads and different APC components, monitoring and control performance will be greatly improved and the number of required models will be significantly reduced. Specifically merits of each project are summarized below. <br/>Project 1: State estimation and control model update: It will provide theoretical analysis on the non-threaded state estimation problem; in addition, it will develop a systematic approach for non-threaded state estimation and control model update for high-mix production, which handles large-scale nonlinear systems through a linear regression formulation. <br/>Project 2: Control performance assessment and diagnosis (CPA/CPD): Instead of comparing the actual control performance against a theoretical benchmark, the proposed framework explicitly estimates model-plant mismatch and disturbance dynamics to achieve CPA/CPD simultaneously. In addition, it will provide the first non-threaded CPA/CPD tools for RtR controllers in high-mix fabs. <br/>Project 3: Statistical process monitoring: Analyzing the pattern of batch statistics instead of the pattern of process variables for SPM is planned. The approach eliminates data pre-processing required by threaded methods, greatly improves monitoring performance, and significantly reduces the number of required models. <br/>Broader Impact: This research will have an immediate impact on the industrial practice of semiconductor manufacturing, as it specifically addresses emerging industrial needs. Due to the complexity of semiconductor processes and the critical role of APC in fab-wide monitoring and control, the problem addressed in this research has the potential to transform the way industry performs process control. <br/>Because few restrictions were posed during the framework development, the proposed framework is not limited to the semiconductor processes, instead, it can also be applied to the batch-oriented pharmaceutical, specialty chemical, and polymer industries and could inspire new solutions and research directions in general batch process monitoring and control. <br/>This research promotes the education of control engineers for semiconductor manufacturing at both graduate and undergraduate levels. Currently, U.S. semiconductor companies are facing challenges in sustaining a well-qualified semiconductor workforce, including engineers in the area of process control. Therefore, the three universities are committed to the continuing education and training of students and professionals in semiconductor manufacturing process control. Moreover, these projects are potential resources for involving minorities and giving them research experience in semiconductor process control. Finally, the PIs will offer short courses on the new process control paradigm to mid-career professionals in the semiconductor industries."

Neural crest cells evolved in vertebrates and are required for the development of numerous vertebrate-specific characters, including cartilage within the head.   The central goal of Dr. McCauley's research is to determine how the evolution and development of cartilage in vertebrates is related to the duplication of a single Sox E gene that is also present in invertebrates. The duplicated SoxE genes, Sox8, Sox9, and Sox10 play an important role in neural crest specification, but the importance of this gene duplication to the evolution of facial cartilage is not known.  Dr. McCauley will use a molecular approach to interfere with the function of individual Sox proteins in a primitive vertebrate, the sea lamprey, to determine their roles in the development of cartilage from neural crest.  The lamprey was chosen because of its primitive relationship to other vertebrate species.  Results of this research are expected to reveal how lamprey SoxE genes regulate cartilage development and whether the fundamental developmental mechanisms of cartilage formation derived from neural crest cells are common to all vertebrates.  This research will have broad impacts for the scientific and education communities.  These studies will integrate research and higher education and will involve undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds in original laboratory research, in addition to training graduate students and post-doctoral investigators.  Results will be of interest to a diverse audience since studies on the ""primitive"" lamprey are relevant to understanding the evolution and development of ""advanced"" model vertebrates.  Techniques developed and used in this research will also be applied to a laboratory course currently under development by Dr. McCauley.  Students in this course will learn how molecular, developmental, and bioinformatics tools are used to address questions related to the evolution of novel traits."

The PI will investigate these laws and focus on transport of fluid, current and solutes in nanochannels fabricated in a silica-based matrix. The PI will test the hypothesis that small current leakage across the silica layers affects the electric field. Testing of the hypothesis that the counterion valence is important for the transport in nanochannels will use the same experimental approaches and will add a level of complexity that will allow a better understanding of the transport in confined fluidic nanochannels in the silica media. Finally, examination of the fluid flow and analyte transport in micro and nanofluidic channels using electroosmotic force generated by remotely operated semiconductor diodes and alternate current fields is planned. This study will introduce further complications due to relaxation and polarization effects related to the ionic distribution in the vicinity of the diode/solution interface. The deep understanding of single and multiphase transport at such length-scales is of paramount importance for the successful implementation of micro and nanofluidics in engineering. The execution of the research will improve the knowledge of micro and nanofluidic systems and the design, fabrication and operation of integrated electronic-fluidic chips for micro and nanofluidic applications. Micro and nanofluidics are important thrust areas for the University of New Mexico in both research and education. Selected topics will be introduced in the Introduction to Transport Phenomena undergraduate course that is taught by the PI.  Dr. Petsev is also developing a new graduate course on the fundamentals of Nanofluidics, which was taught for the first time recently. The University of New Mexico traditionally has a leading role in the education of Hispanic and Native American in New Mexico. The proposed program will enhance and complement the PI's outreach activities for Hispanic students and set up a strong outreach program that includes Native American high school students. In addition, two students from the high school will join the PI's group for summer hands-on research.

Through a combination of experiment (Anderson) and first principles simulations (Hinde) the project goal is to use the IR spectroscopy to quantify how the presence of the hydrogen ?solvent? perturbs the electronic structure of the open-shell atom.  Most chemistry occurs in the presence of a solvent and these fundamental studies are aimed at understanding how solvent effects are manifested in simple atomic radical reactions with molecular hydrogen.  This will be accomplished by first developing a theoretical framework for understanding the solvent-induced perturbation of the electronic structure of chlorine atoms (Cl) trapped in solid hydrogen.  The knowledge gained in these halogen atom studies will then be applied to oxygen atom (O) doped solid hydrogen to study solvent perturbations of the prototypical combustion reaction of O-atoms with molecular hydrogen.  The goal of this research is to develop the spectroscopic analysis such that solid hydrogen doped with atomic radicals can be used as a new reaction medium to study the details of low temperature chemistry in a condensed phase.  <br/><br/>Frozen molecular hydrogen is a unique crystalline solid that is distinguished as a quantum solid due to pronounced quantum mechanical effects of the hydrogen molecule at the low temperatures at which hydrogen freezes (T<13.8 K).

To date, however, studies on particle electrophoresis have been limited to primarily theoretical or numerical analyses in straight microchannels of simple geometries. Very little work has been done on the particle electrophoretic motion in real microchannels which usually consist of one or multiple turns in order to fit them into the small footprint of, for example, a glass slide.  Our goals in this proposal are to obtain a fundamental knowledge of particle electrophoresis in curved microchannels, and to explore the applications of microchannel turns as passive control elements of particle transport in microfluidic systems. We will understand and implement the continuous focusing, filtration, and separation of microparticles during their electrophoretic motions through curved microchannels. All these processes stem from the turn-induced dielectrophoretic force that deflects particles across the streamlines of electrokinetic flow.<br/>Three research thrusts will be carried out by a PhD student using a combined experimental, numerical, and theoretical method: 1) fundamental study of particle electrophoresis in single microchannel turns; 2) application study of particle focusing in serpentine microchannels; and 3) application study of particle separation in spiral microchannels.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The proposed fundamental study of particle electrophoresis within turns will fill the blank in the current knowledge of electrophoretic motion in real microchannels. The proposed electrodeless dielectrophoretic focusing of particles in serpentine microchannels eliminates the use of sheath flows and in-channel or on-chip electrical components, and thus substantially simplifies the fabrication and operation and reduces the probability of device fouling. The proposed electrodeless dielectrophoretic separation of particles in spiral microchannels can work in a rapid continuous manner without the need for external force fields or mechanical or electrical parts as the applied electric field generates the concurrent pumping, focusing and separation of particles.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The acquired knowledge of particle electrophoresis within turns will essentially benefit every engineering application of this transport in microfluidic devices. The ability to continuously focus, filtrate and separate particles in curved microchannels as described here will stimulate the exploration and exploitation of inert microstructures (e.g., turns, ridges, and posts, etc.) as passive control elements in larger microfluidic systems. We envision direct near-term applications of the proposed electrodeless dielectrophoretic focusing approach in continuous bioparticle separation, high-throughput flow cytometry, and continuous filtration systems for a wide range of technological solutions in biology, medicine and industry.<br/><br/>Education: This proposed research will be intimately integrated into the undergraduate and graduate education at Clemson University and the high school outreach in South Carolina. Undergraduate and high school students will be actively involved in this research through various programs available in the department, university, and state, with an emphasis on the inclusion of women, underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities.

The proposed research project focuses on understanding the influence of finite size on the properties of two intriguing vanadium oxides, VO2 and V2O5. Bulk VO2 shows a dramatic insulator?metal phase transition at ~67°C and represents a textbook problem in solid-state chemistry and physics. The proposed work is inspired by our preliminary results showing a strong size dependence of the phase-transition temperature and hysteresis for VO2 nanostructures prepared by hydrothermal methods. Chemical vapor deposition and hydrothermal approaches for the fabrication of VO2 nanostructures with controlled shape, size, and growth direction will be explored. A systematic investigation of the crystal growth mechanism will be performed to obtain rational and predictive control over the nanostructure dimensions. A combination of ensemble X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction measurements will be used in conjunction with single-nanowire electrical transport and Raman spectroscopy measurements to understand the influence of finite size on the insulator?metal phase transition in these nanostructures. Another aspect of the proposed CAREER proposal will involve the fabrication of V2O5 nanowires and their dielectrophoretic integration within device structures. Simultaneous electrical conductivity and Raman spectroscopy measurements of single nanowires will be performed within device geometries to understand the influence of finite size in modifying the electrical transport and surface conductance of these nanowires in the presence of alcohol vapors. The synthesis and device integration of anisotropic VO2 and V2O5 nanostructures will pave the way for their implementation in optical switching devices, thermochromic coatings, Mott field-effect transistors, alcohol sensors, and waveguides.<br/><br/>Non-Technical Summary<br/><br/>Nanoscale materials often show properties that are not exhibited by their bulk counterparts. The proposed research effort is focused on understanding how such properties can be harnessed for practical applications such as making faster electronic circuits for use in the next generation of computers, ?smart? window materials that change color with temperature, and accurate sensors for detecting low concentrations of vapors. Vanadium dioxide, one of the materials that will be explored in this project, is a transparent insulator at room temperature but upon heating to 67°C becomes an excellent conductor that is almost completely opaque. The proposed research will focus on shifting this transition closer to room temperature wherein this dramatic effect can be used to construct ultrafast nanoelectronic circuits and temperature-sensitive coatings. An integrated outreach and education program is also proposed emphasizing teacher professional development, classroom engagement, and curricular reform at the middle-school level at a local urban high-needs school. These activities will serve to build sustained mentoring relationships between faculty, graduate students, undergraduate students, and middle-school teachers and students. This effort will seek to actively engage Buffalo Public School middle-school students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds in appreciating science and technology at a critical and formative time period. The collaborative development of attractive curricular material and challenging laboratory experiments along with sustained classroom visitation and after-school science activities will form the cornerstone of this program.

Young stars are generally surrounded by dusty gas, out of which they have formed.  The dust absorbs some of the light from the hot gas, blocking blue light more strongly than red.  Dr Takamiya will compare images of her galaxies in both the red line of H-alpha and the green line of H-beta, to estimate how strong the blocking effect is.  A further check will come from maps in the mid-infrared made from space observations, and maps at radio wavelengths, since these are almost unaffected by dust.  The results obtained in nearby galaxies will be extrapolated to distant disk galaxies, where in general only lines such as H-alpha at optical wavelengths can be measured easily for large samples.  This extrapolation will yield better estimates of the rate at which galaxies have formed their stars throughout cosmic history.<br/><br/>This project will provide research opportunities to undergraduate students at Dr. Takamiya's institution.  Six undergraduate students will be hired to participate in writing observing proposals to gain access to telescopes on Mauna Kea, to carry out the observations, reduce and analyze them, and to present the results in professional meetings. The University of Hawaii at Hilo is located in the most ethnically diverse county in the USA, and members of under-represented groups will be encouraged to participate in this research.

These modifications have dramatic effects on binder and mixtures? mechanical properties such as stiffness, harness, adhesion, and cohesion.  Understanding how and what structural modifications affect the asphalt binder and mixtures? mechanical properties has remained unexplored, largely because these modifications occur at the atomic to molecular scales. This research offers a novel approach to understating the link between asphalt molecular structure and mechanical behavior through nanoscale experimentation and advanced molecular modeling. In this research, molecular dynamic models will be developed, validated, and employed to predict rheological and mechanical properties determined in the laboratory using nano experimentation, in addition to other traditional methods.<br/><br/>This project is an integration of asphalt chemistry and mechanics, which will be integrated in an educational program that will improve the quality of engineering education. The molecular dynamics simulation will be supported through industry collaboration, which will strengthen the PI?s on-going research activities, and benefit the industry from broadening its product applications. This study may result in a general understanding of aging at a molecular scale, which is applicable to a wide range of construction materials. The integration of research and teaching will be addressed by involving graduate students, increasing diversity in engineering education, outreaching to high school students, development of new courses, and broad dissemination of research results.<br/>"

Hydrophobicity is a fundamental property that is responsible for numerous physical and biophysical behaviors of nonpolar substances in water. This water-induced effective attraction between nonpolar molecules is called the hydrophobic interaction. The interplay between hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties is due to conformational changes in biologically important molecules and is responsible for many of their biochemical functionality, such as stability and penetration of bilipid cell membranes, protein folding and misfolding, DNA-protein interaction and many other related phenomena. This project will study the hydrophobicity switching in response to various physical and chemical stimuli for possible regulation of molecule and ion transport through lipid bilayers or cell membranes.  A systemic study of hydrophobic switching will be carried out to understand the release of intracellular release of molecules including drugs in response to their high concentrations using two types of nanopores, namely, hydrophobic nanoporous membranes and hydrophobic nanotubes.  In addition, the proposed model for a new drug delivery mechanism will be evaluated that could avoids endocytosis and thus avoiding many side effects during intracellular drug delivery.<br/> <br/><br/> The proposed project is expected to develop an understanding of how to control<br/>hydrophobicity and transport of molecules and ions through hydrophobic nanopores, and this knowledge base is critical in the development of novel drug delivery systems.

The cross-departmental, interdisciplinary research program addresses the need for new concepts in low cost, portable sensing devices that can protect against environmental hazards and toxic chemical-biological agents.  The research will investigate nanofabricated tunnel junctions and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) for solid state sensor devices.  The advantages of this work over existing concepts include: (1) sensitivity down to the single molecule level, (2) all solid state construction that allows integration into complex hybrid systems, (3) a device design that is conducive to low cost manufacturing, and (4) spectral identification of unknown molecular agents.  The research will investigate a novel combination of nanofabrication techniques with atomic layer chemistry to engineer 1-2 nm spaced metal-molecule-metal tunnel junctions that will be doped with model compounds and investigated with IETS for spectral identification.  <br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the research program are the underlying science of molecular devices, including the understanding of molecule-electrode chemical interactions and charge transport through single molecule devices.  In particular, there is a need for experimental data to connect physical properties and electrical measurements in single molecule tunnel junctions.  IETS provides a probe of molecular structure in nanofabricated junctions that will advance the science and engineering of molecule-based devices.  <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the research program are significant for future technologies based on molecular devices that enable low cost, ubiquitous sensors that protect the public from environmental hazards and toxic chemical-biological agents.

The viability and success of many of these applications critically hinges on the availability of the underlying wireless communication. As wireless networks become increasingly pervasive, the problem of radio interference and jamming will be inevitable, raising a serious threat to the availability of wireless services.  To enable the continuous and highly-available data delivery services over the entire lifetime of wireless networks in support of wireless applications, it is crucial that the wireless networks have built-in strong defense mechanisms against interference and jamming.<br/> <br/>This project aims to develop a suite of holistic solutions that monitor the radio environment and provide quick recovery to interrupted services in case of jamming or radio interference. In contrast to traditional techniques, such as spread spectrum which requires costly new hardware, the proposed techniques involve networks to manage their resources collaboratively across all layers to assure the availability of network services, leveraging existing commodity wireless platforms. Through the interaction with industry partners, the project results are expected to provide guidance for coping with jamming in future network architecture. <br/> The educational component of this project seeks to prepare students to face the challenges of rapidly evolving technologies in wireless networks.

The U.S. must set effective policy regarding this, but the inherently computational issues lead to a great deal of uncertainty.   We are studying the dynamics of modern Internet censorship implementations to understand how their low-level mechanisms (for example, at the level of individual Internet packets) affects the application-level behavior of censorship that web users actually experience.<br/><br/>Internet censorship implementations are inherently computational, thus whether or not content is available to a user can depend on key issues such as routing and protocol dynamics.  Current characterizations of censorship are incomplete, not founded on quantitative measurements, and cite experiments that cannot be reproduced.  We are addressing this by laying a solid computational foundation for Internet censorship research.  Central to this effort is Internet measurement of existing censorship implementations to understand and compare their dynamics at the packet- and application-level.  This will impact both policy development and the future design of computer networks to address Internet censorship, a critical issue that directly harms U.S. interests by hindering the ability of human rights organizations and U.S. government agencies to disseminate information.  Understanding the connections between Internet censorship and computational issues will also enable the integration of this research throughout the computer science curriculum at UNM and other institutions."

For example, many plants use photoperiod, or the relative length of light and dark periods in a 24-hour day, to determine whether impending environmental conditions are favorable and thus regulate the onset of flowering.  The molecular mechanisms by which photoperiod regulates the onset of flowering in plants are not fully understood.  This project uses Japanese morning glory plants to investigate whether the plant hormone ethylene is involved in regulating plant flowering time in response to photoperiod.   Ethylene has well-established roles in many developmental processes in plants, including fruit ripening and leaf senescence, but its role in photoperiodic flowering is unclear.  Molecular biology techniques will be applied to determining whether the expression of various flowering genes in Japanese morning glory is reduced when ethylene biosynthesis or ethylene signaling in the plants is disrupted. The research will fill in a major gap in our knowledge of plant flowering, while at the same time provide training in biological research to numerous undergraduate students at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution in rural Vermont.  Finally, the research will impact agriculture as most crop plants are annual plants, and determining when to flower is critical for their reproductive success.  <br/><br/>"

During the proposed two field seasons a total of 6x100 m and additional 15 m cores will be combined with trenching.  The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is that the results of this work will extend the landmark work of EPICA and other deep ice coring efforts, which give records dating back to 0.8 Ma, and will complement work planned by IPICS to drill a continuous Antarctic ice core extending to 1.5 Ma. The results will help to advance understanding of major climate regimes and transitions that took place between 0-2.5 Ma, including the 40 kyr world and the mid-Pleistocene climate transition. A major long-term scientific goal is to provide a transformative approach to the collection of paleoclimate records by establishing an ""International Climate Park"" in the Allan Hills BIA that would enable sampling of large quantities of known age ice as old as 2.5 Ma, by any interested American or foreign investigator. The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include training students who are well versed in advanced field, laboratory and numerical modeling methods combining geochemistry, glaciology, and paleoclimatology. We will include material relevant to our proposed research in our ongoing efforts in local education and in our outreach efforts for media. The University of Maine already has cyberinfrastructure, using state of the art web-based technology, which can provide a wide community of scientists with fast access to the results of our research. The work will contribute to the broad array of climate change studies that is informing worldwide understanding of natural and anthropogenic forced climate change, and the options for responding.

Both are needed to accomplish the United States biofuel objective of providing 30% of the nation's transportation fuels with biofuels. To meet the goals of the project, The PI plans to improve the temporal and spatial resolution of ultrasound correlation velocimetry, evaluate the rheology and structure of liquefied biomass fluids, and characterize wall-bounded turbulent biomass flows. These studies will provide previously unobtainable information that will enable predictive estimations of the transport of liquefied biomass in wall-bounded turbulent flows. The role of turbulence in energy sector technologies will be the theme of the educational and outreach activities. Drawing on the research topics, the objective is to educate students and educators through industrial research opportunities, workshops, and outreach that understanding the effects of turbulence and their control is critically important to current and future energy systems. The broader impacts of the research are to acquire and transfer fundamental knowledge to allow greater use of 'homegrown' renewable fuels in the US; acquire and improve a UCV system allowing the study of a variety of other rheological, multiphase, opaque fluid flow problems; and attract and train highly qualified students interested in the fields of energy, turbulence, and complex fluids. Integration of education and research activities is achieved by offering industrial research opportunities for the PI's graduate students, syllabus enrichment, K-12 outreach, continuing education, and participating in University outreach days by including lab tours and demonstrations. Lastly, the PI will actively recruit target minorities to work in his labs and potential Ph.D. students through Project REIS@UNH (Research Experience In Science at UNH), a collaboration between UNH and the Harlem Children Society; and postings in several publications targeting minority populations."

It harnesses the substantial complementary expertise of the international partners and their institutions to address a problem that has world-wide implications for human health and aquatic related industries.  The results will be used for the generation of a commercially applicable prototype device that could have the potential to be applied to a wide range of different analytical problems.  The program will involve significant exchange of personnel and expertise and will generate novel scientific data and approaches linked with the solution of a key problem for all the partners' jurisdictions.<br/><br/>This project will develop a set of easily portable instruments that can be utilized for biotoxin and toxic organism detection, and be adapted subsequently for monitoring of other potentially harmful organisms and their toxins.  A key element for any field deployable sensing instrument is the acquisition and preparation of samples.  Thus, the proposed research includes development of a sample preparation platform and associated protocols for concentration and delivery of targeted toxin and nucleic acid sequences to a hand-held detection device.   The expected outcome is the development of a sample preparation module and assay methods for an optical detection device, based on planar waveguide technology, capable of measuring in real time the presence of both toxin producing organisms and the toxins themselves in coastal and fresh water samples.  The sample preparation module will involve the integration of novel microfluidics with peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and engineered broad affinity, highly stable capture antibodies. Resultant extracts will be introduced into the detection system, which will employ an array-based, planar waveguide technology previously incorporated into a hand-held device by a commercial partner and made available to project collaborators for development of assays for toxins and organisms.  They will utilize highly specific, engineered antibodies for capturing toxin molecules and PNAs as capture probes to detect the corresponding toxigenic organisms.  This technology is expected to provide new and improved means of assessing the potential risks associated with contamination of coastal and fresh water fishery resources by algal biotoxins.<br/><br/>The US-Ireland Partnership Program has been endorsed at the highest political levels by the three jurisdictions (U.S., Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland).  The added value for the U.S. from the BEACONS proposal includes a combination of significant intellectual and financial contributions from Ireland.  Moreover, the project will involve a well coordinated exchange of researchers between the participating organizations.  In particular, the opportunities of exchange visits for young scientists employed on the project will be important from both scientific and cultural perspectives.  A critical element of detecting any analyte is sample processing.  Therefore, in addition to stronger international collaborations and training of young scientists, this project aims to provide a new portable and flexible platform that can be adapted for the sensor-based detection of other biotoxins and/or microbes."

Normal epithelial development requires that epithelial cells are able to sense where they are within the layer and can orient, or polarize, themselves correctly in response to this information. How genetic signals control epithelial cell polarization has been most effectively addressed using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model organism. To date, however, studies in Drosophila have only addressed how cells are polarized in a single direction or along one axis of the epithelium. Recent work using Drosophila in Dr Collier's lab has begun to identify genetic mechanisms that polarize cells along both epithelial axes. This research project will further characterize these mechanisms resulting in a more complete understanding of normal epithelial development. Dr Collier's research lab is in Marshall University, the second largest state institution for higher learning in West Virginia. A large majority of Marshall students are first generation students from Appalachia, a region with considerable educational challenges. Dr Collier's lab has a strong history of providing opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and K-12 students to participate in genetics research.

While anger can reduce depth of information processing and promote biased decisions, sadness can promote systematic processing and facilitate objective decision making. Thus, the potential for VIS to influence juror sentencing decisions might depend on whether jurors experience sadness or anger in response to VIS. <br/><br/>The first study examines VIS from actual capital cases. For descriptive analyses, method of VIS delivery, number length of VIS testimony, and emotional content of VIS will be examined. Content analysis of VIS will be done to assess the emotions typically expressed by victims, and whether angry or sad VIS predicts sentencing decisions. The second study manipulates sadness and anger (using VIS obtained in Study 1) and measures the effect of these specific emotions on sentencing decisions and information.<br/><br/>Little research has examined the effects of specific negative emotions on juror information processing and decision making. The results of these studies will contribute to basic theory on the effects of emotions on decision making. Furthermore, results will inform the applied field of psycho-legal science and aid in understanding of how non-legal factors influence jury decision making.<br/><br/>Results will shed light on how and when victim impact statements lead to biased decisions, and may provide the courts with information to guide how they accept VIS in their jurisdictions. Research results will be disseminated broadly, and a large database of capital sentencing transcripts will be created and made available to other researchers."

This activity centers on the Wyoming Applied Analysis & Computing Group, a team consisting of undergraduate and graduate students, University of Wyoming faculty, and faculty from Wyoming's network of community colleges. <br/><br/>Nonlinear partial differential equations arise generically in mathematical models of physical phenomena.  However, a broad understanding of their properties remains a fundamental challenge in pure and applied mathematics. The differential equations that are the focus of this research are physically motivated, and their features (nonlinearity, multiple space dimensions, multiple scales) represent some of the central challenges in the analysis of such equations.  The research agenda includes investigation of a recent conjecture about the formation of violent oscillations in the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation; this conjecture is part of an emerging belief that the formation of these oscillations may have a universal character.  The validation of the appearance of such universal behavior in differential equations is certain to drive a wave of new developments in the analysis of nonlinear phenomena.  On a mathematical level, the plan of attack is based on a broad array of analytical techniques, including Evans functions, singular perturbations, dynamical systems, spectral theory for linear operators, complex analysis, and numerical analysis.  The anticipated results, if achieved, have the potential to make an impact on applications and other areas of mathematics.  One of the research projects aims to extend the asymptotic analysis of Riemann-Hilbert problems arising in the analysis of integrable partial differential equations; such extensions are expected to be useful in the seemingly unrelated analysis of orthogonal polynomials and random matrices.<br/><br/>The breadth of mathematical tools required by the research agenda ensures that the Wyoming Applied Analysis & Computing Group will serve as an ideal training ground in applied analysis and computation for the next generation of researchers and students.  In addition to collective work on the research agenda, the group will host an annual two-week immersion into research activities for select community-college faculty.  Additionally, the group's activities will include participation in the annual ""articulation conferences"" that are held to connect the math and science departments at the University of Wyoming with those at Wyoming's seven community colleges.  These activities will strengthen the mathematical network across the state.  The group's recruitment and training strategy is partially based on the development of a novel calculus course that treats numerical methods as an intrinsic part of calculus.  The course prepares students to participate in the group at an early stage of their careers. <br/>"

Fibers of collagen are processed in situ as they form in vivo, and this processing introduces irreversible changes that cannot be undone by any physical or chemical extraction process.  Consequently, a synthetic analog is extremely desirable as a route to obtaining useful quantities of this versatile protein for materials or therapeutic applications.  This proposal presents a biologically inspired approach whereby collagen triple helices self-assemble and are then guided to fibrillar oligomerization.  The key process is an energetically coupled stabilization of the triple helix with concomitant setting of the staggered polypeptide register.  The approach uses metal-directed assembly to form two fundamental structures: capping trimers and propagating trimers.  The capping trimers are aligned by metal complex formation at either the N-terminal or the C-terminal ends (N-cap and C-cap, respectively).  They present ""sticky"" connections at the other end, in which the terminal residues are offset from each other.  The propagating trimers are assembled by metal complexation in the middle of the sequence, and present staggered sequences at either end that are complementary to the N/C caps.  Binding of the N-cap and C-cap trimers to the appropriate ends of the propagating species, rather than forming an N-Cap/C-Cap dimer, is driven by electrostatic complementarity.  It is possible consequently to access much larger procollagen subunits than has hitherto been possible, and the assembly process itself is subject to a much higher degree of control.  <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  There is currently no practical route to a synthetic collagen, and success in the proposed research could have far reaching benefits for many aspects of regenerative medicine.  The PI has collaborations with the College of Medicine at the University of Vermont (UVM) with groups working on spinal reconstruction and blood clotting, both of which activities would benefit from the availability of synthetic collagen.  The project will support the work of one graduate student in a highly interdisciplinary environment as well as 4 - 5 undergraduates per year.  Funds are budgeted for support of the undergraduate research students.  As a participant in Project SEED of the American Chemical Society, the PI will provide opportunities for economically disadvantaged high school students to participate in a meaningful research project in his laboratory during the summer months."

The research is focused on the vortex filament equation (VFE) that describes the motion of the vortex filament, assuming that the motion of a vortex filament in an incompressible, inviscid fluid is due to its own induction. The VFE is related to the nonlinear Schroedinger equation via a Hasimoto map. The project will take advantage of this relation to investigate stability of special solutions (Hasimoto solitons) for VFE, and to extend the analysis to the models that incorporate physical effects initially neglected by the idealized VFE model. <br/><br/>Hasimoto solitons take the form of localized loops traveling along the vortex filament. Solitary waves of vortices in turbulent fluids have been observed both in laboratory and numerical experiments. While the most commonly encountered phenomena involving vortex filaments are waterspouts and tornadoes, the study of vortex filaments has fascinating applications to other aspects of science such as in superfluidity and superconductivity. In specific applications, Hasimoto solitons occur, for example, in the context of superconductivity, of tornadoes, of particle transport in a fluid by solitons, and of laser-matter interaction. Although they have been studied abundantly in the literature not much is known about their stability. The main purpose of this project is studying solutions' stability properties, which is of fundamental importance, since only stable solutions can be realized and observed experimentally. The project involves a broad participation of undergraduate and graduate students. In the process of doing research the students will learn sophisticated numerical and mathematical methods needed to carry this research through."

This project examines the interactions among multiple elements and disturbances (nitrogen, phosphorus, metals, and acidification) along a continuum from the atmosphere through soils to streams.  This project takes advantage of two unique experiments in which entire watersheds have been experimentally enriched with nitrogen and acid for nearly two decades.  A series of new studies in those watersheds examine how chemical and biological changes in soils alter the ability of streams to take up, use, and retain nitrogen and phosphorus.  These nutrient interactions are then related to important biological processes that affect the productivity and health of streams.<br/><br/>This research addresses an important pollution problem that requires an approach that integrates biology and geochemistry along flow paths that link the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  This type of integration is a challenge, but needed for effective environmental management, environmental research, and science teaching.  Results from this project and interactions between university and US Forest Service researchers will inform effective management of watersheds faced with multiple pollution problems.  A series of collaborative workshops in which high school, undergraduate, and graduate students work with researchers and teachers will promote multidisciplinary learning.

These mechanisms regulate gene expression through the actions of microRNAs (miRNAs), a family of evolutionarily conserved and endogenously expressed non-coding RNAs. Important aspects of mature miRNA biosynthesis remain poorly understood; this CAREER project will address several fundamental questions using an alliance of NMR structural and biochemical investigations to fill major gaps in our knowledge of the intriguing miRNA world. The long-term objective of this project is to understand the principles of miRNA processing at the molecular level, in particular the fundamentals of early primary (pri-)miRNA recognition by the microprocessor complex. Ultimately, the goal is to test the overall hypothesis that so far unknown miRNA structural characteristics exist that define the underlying determinants of microprocessor substrate specificity.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Knowledge of the structure of miRNAs and their complexes with cellular factors involved in processing is central to understanding gene regulation. Unraveling specific structural features of pri-miRNAs would allow for a more accurate prediction of bona fide miRNA precursor sequences. In turn, a comprehensive understanding of miRNA biosynthesis and function would facilitate optimization of gene inactivation strategies mediated by artificial, small interfering (si)RNAs. This CAREER project describes research at the interface of structural biology, biochemistry, and genetics and provides ample opportunities for collaborative research exposing undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows to the interdisciplinary nature of modern research. The main educational goal is to establish a comprehensive NMR based Structural and Functional Biology (NMR-SFB) training program that exposes students to ongoing, cutting-edge research, integrated within the Center for Structural Biology at MUSC. A key outreach effort, the 1st NMR Summer Camp, was established in May 2008.

Semiconductor technology lies at the heart of the revolution in computing, communications, consumer electronics, transportation and health care. In the last decade, diversified demand from consumers has been pushing semiconductor industry to produce many differentiated products. As a result, multi-product-multi-tool (""high-mix"") manufacturing has become increasingly the standard manufacturing model, which poses many challenges that the current APC framework cannot address. The PIs plan research in the fields of run-to-run (RtR) control, control performance assessment (CPA) and statistical process monitoring (SPM) to meet the emerging needs in high-mix production. <br/>Intellectual Merit: The research will create a non-threaded paradigm for high-mix semiconductor manufacturing by breaking from the current tradition of threaded APC, and provide new theories and techniques to address the challenges posed by high-mix production. By sharing information among different threads and different APC components, monitoring and control performance will be greatly improved and the number of required models will be significantly reduced. Specifically merits of each project are summarized below. <br/>Project 1: State estimation and control model update: It will provide theoretical analysis on the non-threaded state estimation problem; in addition, it will develop a systematic approach for non-threaded state estimation and control model update for high-mix production, which handles large-scale nonlinear systems through a linear regression formulation. <br/>Project 2: Control performance assessment and diagnosis (CPA/CPD): Instead of comparing the actual control performance against a theoretical benchmark, the proposed framework explicitly estimates model-plant mismatch and disturbance dynamics to achieve CPA/CPD simultaneously. In addition, it will provide the first non-threaded CPA/CPD tools for RtR controllers in high-mix fabs. <br/>Project 3: Statistical process monitoring: Analyzing the pattern of batch statistics instead of the pattern of process variables for SPM is planned. The approach eliminates data pre-processing required by threaded methods, greatly improves monitoring performance, and significantly reduces the number of required models. <br/>Broader Impact: This research will have an immediate impact on the industrial practice of semiconductor manufacturing, as it specifically addresses emerging industrial needs. Due to the complexity of semiconductor processes and the critical role of APC in fab-wide monitoring and control, the problem addressed in this research has the potential to transform the way industry performs process control. <br/>Because few restrictions were posed during the framework development, the proposed framework is not limited to the semiconductor processes, instead, it can also be applied to the batch-oriented pharmaceutical, specialty chemical, and polymer industries and could inspire new solutions and research directions in general batch process monitoring and control. <br/>This research promotes the education of control engineers for semiconductor manufacturing at both graduate and undergraduate levels. Currently, U.S. semiconductor companies are facing challenges in sustaining a well-qualified semiconductor workforce, including engineers in the area of process control. Therefore, the three universities are committed to the continuing education and training of students and professionals in semiconductor manufacturing process control. Moreover, these projects are potential resources for involving minorities and giving them research experience in semiconductor process control. Finally, the PIs will offer short courses on the new process control paradigm to mid-career professionals in the semiconductor industries."

A Systemic PARTnership Aimed at Connecting University and School (SPARTACUS) project forms linkages among university researchers and their graduate students with the K-12 community. Focusing on the hydrologic cycle in a coastal watershed it conveys the importance of interdisciplinary efforts in scientific and social issues, to K-12 students and teachers through the work of Graduate Fellows and their advisors. Interrelationships of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and geology are examined in a local watershed using the Saco River Coastal Observing System (SaRCOS). It investigates how precipitation drives river discharge, which in turn, governs the coastal current, which influences coastal weather. While scientifically important, these phenomena are also tangible to students at all levels.<br/>Broader Impacts. The project engages K-12 students and teachers in authentic inquiry-based learning in STEM-related disciplines. This unique project brings together school districts? needs, scientific research, and place-based inquiry education. Graduate Fellows gain an understanding of the educational process, develop communication skills and team building, and appreciate the importance of K-12 outreach as a professional commitment. Place-based inquiry projects are used to engage students in active learning. Schools benefit from professional development of teachers, and enrichment of the learning environment, while society gains greater scientific and technical literacy. The schools encompass rural to urban settings, including the two largest and most ethnically diverse districts in Maine. Replication of the model is highly viable since it is grounded in local environs and research, effectively connecting the community, school and university.<br/>"

Through a combination of experiment (Anderson) and first principles simulations (Hinde) the project goal is to use the IR spectroscopy to quantify how the presence of the hydrogen ?solvent? perturbs the electronic structure of the open-shell atom. Most chemistry occurs in the presence of a solvent and these fundamental studies are aimed at understanding how solvent effects are manifested in simple atomic radical reactions with molecular hydrogen. This will be accomplished by first developing a theoretical framework for understanding the solvent-induced perturbation of the electronic structure of chlorine atoms (Cl) trapped in solid hydrogen. The knowledge gained in these halogen atom studies will then be applied to oxygen atom (O) doped solid hydrogen to study solvent perturbations of the prototypical combustion reaction of O-atoms with molecular hydrogen. The goal of this research is to develop the spectroscopic analysis such that solid hydrogen doped with atomic radicals can be used as a new reaction medium to study the details of low temperature chemistry in a condensed phase. <br/><br/>Frozen molecular hydrogen is a unique crystalline solid that is distinguished as a quantum solid due to pronounced quantum mechanical effects of the hydrogen molecule at the low temperatures at which hydrogen freezes (T<13.8 K). These studies of chemical reactions in a quantum solid will have direct impact on our understanding of quantum mechanical effects in low temperature chemical reactions, the ability to use light to control chemical reaction pathways, and potentially provide transformative insight into both high gravimetric storage and clean production of molecular hydrogen. This research will also provide a rich vehicle for undergraduate and graduate research experience and training."

Documentary work is especially urgent for Shiwilu, since it is in immediate danger of complete disappearance with only a few elderly fluent speakers remaining.  The award also supports the development of reusable software to aid in the production of scientific materials for the linguists and pedagogical materials for community members.  The goals of the project include compiling and digitizing existing wordlists and grammar information, as well as the collection of primary data in the field through digital audio/video recording of consultants. The materials include: spontaneous texts, questionnaires, elicitation, and wordlists.  The resulting corpus will be transcribed, translated into Spanish and English, analyzed and processed in order to produce databases, dictionaries, grammars, and text collections.  Four workshops for community members are being held to raise sociolinguistic awareness, to encourage community involvement in the documentation, and to promote literacy in the native languages.<br/><br/>The project will capture a permanent record of Kawapanan and Amazonian cultural knowledge that will likely disappear in as little as one generation.  A study of Shiwilu and Shawi may have a high scientific impact on the field as there is little systematic descriptive work on Kawapanan as a whole.  It contributes to linguistic typology through the description of specific features such as a set of consonants unusual for the Amazon, classifier systems, highly complex verbs, and pragmatic ergative marking. Also, the project contributes to the reconstruction of Kawapanan, which will help to shed light on its possible inclusion in a larger family or stock. Furthermore, the project includes the use of state-of-the-art digital audio/video recording, and the development of open, reusable annotated data in Unicode/XML.  All data will be preserved in a lasting archive for posterity.  On the technical side, the main intellectual merit is data re-purposing: the production of flexible data to serve the descriptive, computational, or theoretical linguist as well as the anthropologist, the language learner or educator. The project responds to the demands of the Kawapanan communities, who are striving to preserve their languages. The resulting linguistic descriptions, workshops, and learner-oriented resources will be crucial to revitalization efforts.  Finally, the project contributes to the training of two linguistic students."

Drawing on existing research that suggests strong correlations between student autonomy support and outcomes related to SDL, the proposed study examines three research questions. First, in what ways do engineering instructors assist students to become self-directed learners, and are there instructor practices and behaviors that lead to greater student involvement in and ownership of their own learning? The second question asks about students? behavioral and affective responses to different ways autonomy is supported in undergraduate engineering settings. Finally, what effect does a sense of autonomy have on students? perceptions of their own learning? Lifelong learning requires the development of capacities consistent with those of SDL who may be characterized as curious, motivated, reflective, analytical, persistent, flexible, and independent. They possess skills in information seeking, retrieval and metacognitive awareness. Instructors clearly play a critical role in influencing outcomes related to SDL through their design and implementation of courses that foster students? transitions from controlled to autonomous learning behaviors. Participants in this study will be engineering faculty and undergraduate students at four collaborating universities. Education faculty with expertise in motivation and assessment will coordinate the mixed method evaluation plan. <br/><br/>The need for student-centered learning approaches that foster a capacity for lifelong learning is recognized by educators and accreditation agencies as vital for success in today?s engineering environment. The current emphasis in the engineering education community has been on assessing students? lifelong learning capacity by measuring outcomes associated with SDL, rather than on understanding the complex relationship between instructor practices and SDL outcomes. This project will have broad impact since all engineering programs are required to demonstrate that students are gaining the skills needed to be lifelong learners. Broad dissemination of the work through a variety of mechanisms, including national workshops, will aid the development of faculty expertise, contribute to the epistemology of engineering educators, enable the design of more effective teaching environments, and provide a model for implementation of autonomy-supportive engineering curricula that have the potential for direct impact on a diversity of student populations."

In this project, fundamental correlations between dynamics of polymer chains and internal structure of PEMs will be explored, and this knowledge will be applied to develop strategies for the construction of stratified LbL PEM films and to study evolution of their structure during aging.  Specifically, inter-chain dynamics will be explored in three cases: (1) in solution; (2) between solution and the films during multilayer construction; and (3) at a post-assembly step during aging of LBL films in humid or aqueous environments. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), a combination of FCS and in situ ATR-FTIR, and a combination of fluorescence recovery after pattern photobleaching (FRAPP) and neutron reflectivity (NR) will be applied for cases (1)- (3), respectively. The project involves synthesis of well-defined polybase-polyacid (PB-PA) pairs associated through ionic pairing or hydrogen-bonding. The central suggestion is that translational diffusion of polymers within PEMs is anisotropic, and proposed experiments aim to reveal the degree of this anisotropy as well as how this anisotropy evolves with time when PEM films are aged in high humidity environment or in aqueous solutions under varying temperature and/or ionic strength. The knowledge generated in this proposal can be used to predict interactions, motions, relaxations and order in a broad range of PEM films.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This project provides knowledge of dynamics and structure of self-assembled polymer films, which will enable construction and prediction of aging of stratified polymer films for biomedical and optical applications. One example includes polymer coatings enabling sequential delivery of therapeutic compounds from the surface of a biomedical device or an implant. Importantly, this project will create a fertile training ground for the participating graduate students and summer undergraduate students in forefront issues of polymer science, a training ground further enriched by collaboration with NIST and ORNL. A new course on nanostructured polymers will be developed as part of the highly interdisciplinary Stevens Nanotechnology Graduate Program. A significant part of the project includes working with high school students from the Northern New Jersey area and disseminating knowledge through experimental demonstrations and poster exhibition involving K-12 high school students. Through existing close links with the K-12 ACS SEED and the Partners in Science Program NJ program, a new educational initiative will be developed. Specifically, by working with a recently started NSF-funded GK-12 initiative, New Jersey Alliance for Engineering Education (NJAEE), and with the Stevens Center for Innovation in Engineering and Science Education (CIESE), a teaching module Polymers in Our Life will be built and piloted in a high school setting. The module will be featured on the NJAEE website, and linked to the CIESE website, which enjoys hundreds of thousands of site visits by K-12 educators and students each year.<br/>"

Philadelphia AMP represents a diverse alliance of public and private, 2- and 4-year, research and non-research, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and majority institutions.<br/><br/>A salient feature of this proposal is the fundamental manner in which the proposed AMP initiative rests on a solid foundation of partnerships, resources, effective practice and experience derived from fourteen years of collaboration, cooperation and concerted efforts focused on minority student achievement under the current Philadelphia AMP project. During the past fourteen years of the Philadelphia AMP?s existence, the Alliance has contributed $l2.3 million in matching funds to the project through the use of college/university, foundation, state government and corporate funds. Through the Philadelphia Alliance a mechanism has been developed to catalyze changes in institutional departmental and organizational culture and the practices that will result in significant increases in recruitment, retention, STEM degree production, and graduate school entry for all students. Currently, the Alliance has established a firm foundation for the objectives of the proposed senior level Alliance initiative with specific attention to the expansion of a coordinated movement of community college students to 4- year institutions, and subsequently, successfully transitioned through to graduate study. The increased movement of students to graduate study has increased the participation of faculty at the undergraduate and graduate level with expanded domestic, as well as international research opportunities. In support of this AMP initiative, over 200+ tenured STEM faculty, academic department heads, and senior administrative personnel from the nine member institutions will actively participate in recruiting, advising and mentoring AMP students. In this proposal ?minority? refers to African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans.<br/><br/>Through synergistic collaboration, the Alliance utilizes its operational infrastructure to expand available options to enrich programs at partner institutions and beyond. Philadelphia AMP recognizes that sustained increases in the quality and quantity of minority students in undergraduate and graduate STEM degree programs have required not only a re-engineering of the educational system at all levels, but also a sustained mechanism which revisits the curricular adjustments to accommodate the demands of industry and the academy. These adjustments will result in permanent changes in the learning environment in the Alliance institutions, as well as in their policies and practices in terms of allocations of finances, personnel, recruitment, and admissions.<br/><br/>The proposed AMP initiative will utilize the experiences and practices gained through its development to senior level Alliance status to continue to foster the institutionalization of its current activities, and the preparation and transition of students from community colleges to 4-year institutions and from 4-yr institutions to graduate education.<br/><br/>Broader impacts include increasing the number and quality of students from underrepresented groups in Alliance institutions completing STEM B.S degrees and transitioning to graduate study; enhancing partnerships, research collaborations, and articulation strategies between community colleges, HBCU and Ph.D. granting universities, within the Philadelphia AMP and beyond; and enhancing the integration of research and education."

Although it is widely accepted that the heart is one of the first organs to form, the early events during cardiac development when the heart field is initially created remain unclear and are thus the focus of recent research.  Where do the cells that will ultimately create a beating heart come from? How does a cell know it should become a cardiac cell? What are the biological consequences of creating a heart field that is either too large or too small? Because the initial steps necessary to create a functional heart are poorly understood, these questions await a detailed understanding at the molecular, genetic, and biochemical levels. Therefore, interdisciplinary approaches will be used to gain a detailed understanding of the cellular signals that control the development of the embryonic heart. This project is designed to elucidate the role of Notch signaling during the early stages of heart development: the specification and prepatterning of the cardiac mesoderm. A direct benefit of this work will be the characterization of novel molecular mechanisms needed to create the embryonic heart. Understanding how identified molecules direct the creation of heart tissue allows us to gain important insights into designing therapeutics that can be used to treat various cardiac defects, thereby allowing people with cardiac abnormalities to live fuller lives. Moreover, the impact of this work extends to the study of other systems because techniques developed in the course of this research facilitate the manipulation of gene activity during specific stages of organ formation. These novel embryological techniques and approaches will be taught directly to members of the lab, and will be published and presented at scientific meetings to help disseminate valuable ideas to the scientific community that can form the basis of future work. In addition, results obtained from this research will not only be important for researchers, but as part of out-reach programs to introduce students and K-12 science educators to the methodologies and practices used to conduct novel research projects. By integrating research and education, advances in science can be taken to new levels as future generations of researchers are brought one step closer to becoming independent investigators."

The organic form of mercury, methylmercury, is the most readily available form to the organisms making the production of methylmercury the most critical factor determining mercury bioaccumulation in aquatic ecosystems. The ecosystem controls of methylmercury production in streams and rivers are poorly understood, however. The proposed research will investigate the rates and potential mechanisms mediating methylmercury production via filamentous algae, which may be functioning as ?hotspots? of rapid mercury transformations in rivers. Specifically, this research will examine whether the  production of methylmercury  is related to the growth stages of filamentous algae in a river ecosystem where hydrology, food web relationships and ecosystem processes are well characterized from previous studies. By measuring in-situ mercury methylation rates and manipulating both microbial and photosynthetic activities, this research will elucidate key ecological factors that mediate the role of filamentous algae in mercury transformations in natural rivers. <br/><br/>The project integrates different scientific disciplines toward understanding a highly complex environmental issue - ecosystem mediation of mercury contamination. The proposed work will provide fundamental knowledge regarding the cycling of mercury in stream and river ecosystems. The new knowledge may allow the prediction of changes in availability of mercury to aquatic food webs in response to effects of altered land use such as forest clearing and nutrient enrichment. In addition, the proposed work will provide educational and research opportunities for a graduate student and undergraduate researchers through field sample collection and analyses. Lastly, the results from this proposed study will be widely disseminated through presentations in scientific meetings and publication in peer-reviewed journals."

The field has advanced significantly in recent years with the expanded understanding of the plant mitochondrial genome and its control by the nucleus, together with an explosion of information regarding numerous metabolic pathways that intersect within the mitochondrion or that respond to mitochondrially derived signals.  Mitochondria play important roles in plant metabolism, pollen fertility, programmed cell death, and ROS-mediated cellular control. Much of the recent momentum in this field has been fueled by powerful and unprecedented tools afforded investigators by genome and organelle sequencing projects and advances in cell imaging technologies. The present conference will highlight recent progress in mitochondrial evolution, molecular determinants of mitochondrial morphology and the inheritance of mitochondrial genomes, mitochondrial gene expression and RNA processing, and nuclear-organellar interactions and signaling mechanisms.  The latest progress in understanding mitochondrial influence on plant growth, development, and stress response will also be highlighted. This field is particularly exciting at the moment because it is moving beyond description towards manipulation of mitochondrial behavior and dissection of important signals and pathways. <br/><br/>This conference has a history of moving between continents, with the most recent meetings having been held in Australia, France and Japan, a geographic span reflecting the important contributions that have been made by the worldwide community of scientists in this field. The conference, the first in the U.S. since 1995, will be held in Lake Tahoe, CA. It is the only conference that has traditionally fostered interaction between international investigators with interests in mitochondrial gene function and inter-organellar interaction and those investigating metabolism and electron transport functions. The conference is designed to include presentations by young scientists just entering the field and postdoctoral trainees, together with established leaders in the field.  The program enhances the field by inviting new ideas and new participants, and providing new opportunities for international collaborations. With the upsurge in research on biofuels, the focus of the meeting on plant mitochondria and metabolism is extremely timely."

A further fifty sediment cores will be examined for the presence of alkenone, in order to identify sites for future paleotemperature reconstructions. The proposed interdisciplinary approach combines organic geochemical and stable isotopic techniques novel to the study regions, and represents an innovative approach to paleoclimate research. The study will provide new insights into Holocene climate variability in different regions of the Arctic, and will allow the first multi-millennia, centennial-scale spatial reconstruction of Arctic climate patterns (e.g. the AO/NAO). The research will contribute to a better understanding of the role of climate change in driving patterns of Viking settlement in the Lofoten Islands and High Canadian Arctic during the late Holocene. The benefits of the Post-doctoral Fellowship to the PI include (1) the formation of new partnerships with American and international scientists, (2) cultivate university teaching skills, (3) develop skills for communicating science with the general public, (4) develop and apply new skills in spatial data analysis, and (5) receive training on analytical instruments for future research. The Broader Impacts include (1) increasing the scope of climate research at the UMass Amherst by sharing knowledge of lacustrine alkenone paleothermometry, (2) research opportunities for undergraduates at UMass Amherst, (3) new partnerships for cross-disciplinary research, (4) data to be shared with the scientific community via the National Climatic Data Center, journal publications and presentations at conferences, and with the general public through visits to schools, (5) construction of a project Web site and development of a presentation designed for the general public."

There is currently no generally applicable methodology to layer liver cells in vitro. Although two dimensional (2D) cell cultures and co-cultures are used extensively as model systems, they do not recapitulate key spatial, geometric, and physiological characteristics of cellular architectures found in vivo.  The specific features of this proposal are the design of detachable polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films, the ability to incorporate cell-adhesive ligands such as galactose, tuning the physical properties of the scaffold, and the design of nanoporous detachable polyelectrolyte multilayer films. The specific objectives of the proposal are: (1) Design detachable chitosan/hyaluronan PEM films and demonstrate the feasibility of using them to assemble highly functional 3D liver-mimetic cellular architectures. (2) Tune PEM scaffold film properties to control cell growth and function. (3) Design and assemble nanoporous PEM scaffolds with tunable porosity for efficient transport of nutrients and metabolites. Such liver-mimetic tissues can serve as an accurate model for applications in bioreactor devices, understanding disease pathogenesis, toxicity evaluations, and in the testing of pharmaceuticals and drugs. The detachable PEM-scaffold can be modified, both chemically, and physically to incorporate a diverse range of cell types. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  Hepatocyte tissue culture has challenged the regenerative medicine field for some time.  This proposal holds promise for facilitating a range of investigations of liver pathogenesis, toxicity, and, ultimately, liver-like bioreactor devices.  The PI and Co-PI are both active participants in outreach and educational initiatives on the Virginia Tech campus.  The PI will continue to participate in the VT STARS program, a 3-year residential program focusing on low-income, under-represented youth from South West Virginia, and she has just completed a term as Chair of the AIChE Women's Initiative Committee.  The proposal also details her outreach to female middle and high school students designed to acquaint them with career opportunities in science and engineering.  The Co-PI is a long time participant in the VT Summer Undergraduate Research Program supported by NSF REU and IGERT awards.  Continued commitment to these and other educational initiatives can be anticipated.<br/>"

The conference will  be held on the UC Davis campus in September  2009. The main theme of the conference is to illuminate the particular type of interaction which characterizes the past 40 years of developments in algebra and topology, including the most recent results in contemporary mathematics. The topics to be discussed in the conference will include the current exciting developments in symplectic field theory, representations of infinite- dimensional Lie algebras, and topological quantum field theory, as well as the recent achievements in the topological applications of cohomology of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, characteristic classes of foliations, contact homology, Chekanov- Eliashberg differential graded algebra, and Legendrian knot theory. The most important goal of the conference is to provide an opportunity for a diverse group of mathematicians including postdoctoral researchers, those with traditionally underrepresented background, graduate students, and faculty from primary undergraduate institutions, to meet and discuss mathematics with the invited leading experts of the field. To facilitate the discussions, the organizers will make every effort to bring the diverse audience to the conference, and request the speakers to prepare their talks aimed at the level  at which a second-year graduate student can understand.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The conference will bring three generations of researchers together, and foster scientific interactions across the generation, providing an opportunity to  exchange ideas and to initiate new collaborations among participants. The younger generation can learn the newly established results, new perspectives, and possible future directions of research specifically addressed to them from the leading experts. The founders of the theories will inject how their discoveries were made and what was their vision back then. Expository talks can connect this vision with the current developments, and provide to the audience a sense of strong current and flow of mathematics. The participants will devote one session to compiling a list of open problems in the area that are  most likely to shape the research in the near future. The conference will also include components for dissemination of results as well as outreach to local high school students and the general public. The Scientific Advisory Board will form an editorial board for the conference proceedings volume to be published. Reflecting the tone of the conference, the authors will be encouraged to provide expository articles, survey papers, and research papers readable to graduate students. The talks presented at the conference will be placed on the Conference Website by the local organizers. The outreach activity  will comprise an expository talk by a distinguished speaker in an evening session during the conference. This talk will be an integrated component of the year-long outreach activity of the Department of Mathematics, UC Davis, which brings as many as 400 local high school students and general public to the event."

The two workshops ?Missing Energy Signals at LHC? workshop, and the fourth workshop in the ?Monte Carlo Tools for Beyond the Standard Model Physics? (MC4BSM) series are to be held at University of California, Davis and take place on consecutive days, ?Missing Energy Signals at LHC? workshop on April 1?2 and MC4BSM on April 3?4, 2009. <br/>The purpose of the ?Missing Energy Signals at LHC,? workshop is to discuss the <br/>strategies to search for new physics with jets/leptons plus missing energy signals and how to identify the new physics if such experimental signals are discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). New physics with missing energy signals is highly motivated as most new models with a dark matter candidate will produce such signals at the colliders when the dark matter particles escape the detector. However, searching for such signals and identifying the underlying physics are highly non-trivial because the backgrounds and the detectors need to be understood very well in order to establish such signal events and the missing information carried away by the missing particles needs to be reconstructed to identify the new physics. The workshop will bring together both experimentalists and theorists who are experts in this area to discuss the best approaches to the questions from experimental searches to the model identi&#64257;cations. <br/>The series of the MC4BSM workshops aims to gather together theorists and experimentalists interested in developing and using Monte Carlo tools for Beyond the Standard Model Physics in an attempt to be prepared for the analysis of data focusing on the Large Hadron Collider. Since a large number of excellent tools already exist for the study of low energy supersymmetry and the MSSM in particular, this workshop will instead focus on tools for alternative TeV-scale physics models. <br/>The broader impacts are that the discovery of new physics in the LHC era will require close collaborations between experimentalists and theorists. These workshops provide a platform for such collaborations through detailed discussion and idea exchanges. New tools and strategies will be developed to make the studies and experimental searches of the new physics more e&#64256;ective and powerful. The emphasis will be to enhance the discussion and collaborations between the theorists and the experimentalists along the topics of the workshop. All the talks will be recorded and posted together with the slide &#64257;les on the workshop website for everyone to access. <br/>"

The event provides students opportunities to showcase their engineering talent, innovative thought, and communication skills. Students who participate in undergrad research are able to compete in the Paper Competition, which entails presenting their research in front of judicators from industries and academia. Students may also demonstrate their engineering skills by partaking in the Chem-E Car Competition. This popular competition allows students to work in teams to design, build, and operate cars the size of shoe boxes which run on alternative fuel sources. The main goal of this competition is to be the most accurate in reaching the required distance specified one hour before the competition. Months prior to the competition students are required to use engineering fundamentals to design and construct their vehicles and establish baseline operation through testing and safety assurances. Along with running the car, the teams need to present their design and demonstrate safe engineering practice in the Poster Competition to judges as well as students and conference sponsors. Besides opportunities to compete and present their research, the conference offers a venue for networking with industry representatives at the career and graduate school fair. Another opportunity for students to interact with industry representatives is through professional development workshops.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/><br/>It is expected that more than 100 chemical engineering students will attend this event from as many as 14 universities from the California-Nevada region. Currently, it is confirmed that students will be coming from the following institutions: UC Davis, UC Berkeley. UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, Stanford, University of Nevada Reno, California State University Long Beach, and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The event is also open to the general public and presents a broad means to engage a diverse spectrum of chemical engineering students. Our key note speaker, Bryan Yeh, will give an in depth presentation on alternative fuel sources and technology of the future. Bryan is Vice President of SAIC, an alternative fuels science and technology company in the Bay Area. NSF funding will provide support to ensure that all students, regardless of financial ability, are able to participate in this opportunity that goes beyond normal classroom learning, builds community, and encourages creative behavior."

Prehistoric and modern Native Americans belong to one of five mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups, A, B, C, D and X. Previous studies have reported mtDNA haplogroup frequency distributions in prehistoric Pueblo remains that are characteristic of haplogroup frequencies observed in modern populations in the Southwest but very different from those of Mexico. However, shared derived mutations (haplotypes), which have been either absent from or limited in previous studies, can provide a more detailed view of the populations in the region.  <br/>Two sites found in New Mexico, the Tommy and Mine Canyon sites, yielded aDNA in previous studies and this project will double the number of individuals studied from the Tommy Site and sequence the mtDNA control region in samples from both sites. This larger and better genetically characterized sample will aid in understanding the relationship between the two sites, as previous research demonstrated that there are significant mtDNA differences between them. Four hypotheses will be tested: (1) haplogroup B predominates among the 22 additional Tommy Site samples, and their sequences are shared with other Southwestern, but not Mexican, populations. (2) Samples belonging to haplogroup A are rare at the Tommy Site, but their haplotypes are shared with the Mine Canyon Site as well as other Southwest US populations where haplogroup A has been found at higher frequency. (3) Haplotypes of both haplogroups are shared with Mexican, but not Southwest US populations. (4) Haplotypes of males and females will differ, based on differing demographic factors. The larger sample in this study will aid in answering these, and other, questions by providing insight into regional migration and exploring potential differences between male and  female migration among the prehistoric occupants of the desert Southwest.<br/><br/>The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of Native American prehistory in the Southwest and its potential relationship to prehistoric cultures of Mexico.  This project will enhance international cooperation and understanding regarding the common interests, including history and prehistory, of Mexico and the United States."

The survey is designed to address a puzzling four thousand year gap in the record of human occupation in Mendoza.  Climate scientists have shown that this same four thousand year period, referred to as the middle Holocene (between 8000 and 4000 years ago), was a time of hotter, drier conditions in a number of regions worldwide. Indigenous populations living in areas affected by these large-scale environmental fluctuations were undoubtedly impacted by the resultant changes in resource availability. The apparent break in the Mendoza record implies that the people living there were either incapable of adapting to a deteriorating environment and largely abandoned the region, or that they responded to it in ways that made them less visible archaeologically, giving the misimpression of abandonment. Interpretations of similar gaps observed in middle Holocene archaeological records elsewhere in the world remain controversial due to precisely these alternative possibilities.  In Mendoza, there are simply too few data available to interpret the observed gap.  This survey will sample a broader range of environment types than have been sampled previously to distinguish natural from behavioral factors contributing to the break in the record. <br/><br/>Mendoza is a particularly effective ""laboratory"" for a study of this kind because the region is geographically and climatically comparable to the Great Basin of North America where an analogous middle Holocene gap has been documented.  A comparative study of these two regions allows environmental setting to be held relatively constant while complex responses to resource fluctuations are teased apart.  Understanding behavioral responses to major climatic events in Argentina will clarify larger trajectories of hunter-gatherer adaptive change that are relevant to many regions worldwide.  Moreover, a deeper appreciation of prehistoric problem-solving strategies contributes to an understanding of the rise of modern humans.<br/><br/>In addition to its contributions to empirical and theoretical issues in anthropology, this project will have broader impacts for both the intellectual and the local host communities.  Close consultation among interdisciplinary scientists from US and Argentine institutions will result in both mutual intellectual benefit and a healthy collaborative relationship between international researchers.  Furthermore, field technicians for this project will be recruited from Argentine universities, providing students of archaeology the opportunity for field experience and training.  Finally, the results of this project will be shared with the host community through a formal display at a local museum, a mock archaeological dig, open to public participation, and a series of age-appropriate classroom presentations designed to generate both excitement about archaeology and a sense of stewardship towards cultural heritage.<br/><br/>This award has been jointly funded by NSF's Archaeology Program and Office of International Science and Engineering."

Glassy materials consisting primarily of Ge, Sb, As and Te (chalcogenides) have recently received significant attention due to their extraordinary technological importance in rewritable optical data storage applications in the forms of compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD) and Blu-ray disk and in electronic memory applications.  These chalcogenides have been aptly termed phase-change materials as they show rapid and repeatable switching between crystalline and glassy phases under suitable conditions that forms the basis of writing, reading and storage of data.  However, the details of the structure-property relationships in phase-change chalcogenides are not well understood at the atomic level and they often remain controversial and conjectural, especially in the technologically relevant multi-component systems.  This lack of knowledge regarding the connection between the microscopic and the macroscopic results in extensive trial and error tests in composition and processing related optimization in this fast-paced industry.  We hope to address the fundamental issues associated with the atomic-scale understanding of the key properties of phase-change chalcogenides based on systematic structural and dynamical studies using state-of-the-art experimental and simulation techniques.  Such studies will allow the development of physically more accurate models of structure-property relationships and will better guide future technological development of these materials with improved functionality.  Scientifically, the proposed work impacts materials science, solid-state chemistry and solid-state physics.  The materials studied have actual or potential applications in a wide range of technologies including optical memory devices, telecommunication, remote-sensing and photovoltaics.  The interdisciplinary nature of our research transfers knowledge between fields and provides a unique intellectual environment.  This project will continue to foster ongoing collaborations with scientists in industry, universities and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and to enrich the graduate education and training experience for participating students through scientific dialogue and interactions between the collaborating scientists and students. Students in this research program will learn to investigate problems in the realm of ?basic science? that underlies industrial applications.  This program will coordinate with the underrepresented minority-serving and K-12 outreach programs at UC Davis to attract and recruit underrepresented graduate students and to increase the awareness of students in the science and technology of phase-change chalcogenides.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: <br/>Chalcogenides that primarily belong to the Ge-Sb/As-Te system constitute an important class of materials known as the ?phase-change? materials that display thermally or electrically induced rapid and reversible transformation between crystalline and amorphous phases under suitable conditions.  These chalcogenides have recently received remarkable attention due to their extraordinary technological importance in rewritable optical data storage and non-volatile electronic memory applications.  From the point of view of direct atomic-scale understanding of the phase-change phenomena, a number of fundamental questions remain unresolved in these systems: What are the structural similarities and differences between the amorphous and crystalline phases and how do they affect the relevant physical properties such as density, optical absorption and electrical conductivity? What are the possible effects of pressure and temperature on the structure of the amorphous phase, i.e. do these external variables select a particular structure from a ?landscape? of possible structures? What are the nature, timescales and length scales of the atomic/molecular dynamics in the glassy and supercooled liquid state and how are they related to entropy generation, macroscopic relaxation and transport processes and crystallization kinetics?  Some of these issues are understood only at the macroscopic level within the framework of phenomenological models.  The primary focus of the work proposed here is to address these questions at the microscopic/atomic level using a uniquely powerful combination of neutron/X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, inelastic neutron scattering, 125Te NMR spectroscopy and Reverse Monte Carlo modeling.  Specifically, phase-change chalcogenides in Ge-Sb-Te and Ge-As-Te systems will be investigated.  Models linking the atomic-scale structure and dynamics with macroscopic physical and thermodynamic properties will be formulated and tested. Such studies will allow the development of physically more accurate models of structure-property relationships and although they are in the realm of basic science, they should have long-term significance in guiding future technological development of phase-change materials with improved functionality.

Yellen	05/31/2010	"$29,907.00"		testeele@ucdavis.edu	OR/Sponsored Programs	Davis	CA	956186134	5307547700	SBE	1391	"0000, OTHR"	$0.00	"The study of modern human origins is of fundamental importance for comprehending who we are now and how we came to be this way. Archaeology has a significant role to play in this research, because it is the only field that focuses specifically on the role of culture in human evolution. Most specialists agree that cultural innovations in Africa allowed the ancestors of all living humans to spread throughout the world beginning 50,000 years ago. There is disagreement, however, about the cause of these innovations and the significance of their temporal and spatial patterning. Some researchers suggest that numerous new technologies and behaviors appeared synchronously at the end of the Middle Stone Age (MSA; ~250,000 to ~40,000 years ago), dramatically improving the human adaptive capacity. Others argue that these innovations coalesced gradually throughout the MSA. Resolving such central questions of human cultural evolution requires improved understanding of technological and behavioral developments in the African MSA.<br/>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Teresa Steele and an international team from South Africa, Australia, and the USA will contribute significant new information to this issue by exploring MSA occurrences in the Knersvlakte of Namaqualand, South Africa, an archaeologically undocumented region with a unique environmental setting 265 km N of Cape Town. Artifacts of MSA antiquity are abundant over several kilometers of the modern land surface, and at least three untested rockshelters have been identified which contain numerous MSA artifacts on their adjacent slopes. The project will explore the archaeological potential of the area through test-excavation of at least two of these rockshelter sites, and through analysis of spatial and technological patterns in open-air occurrences. The data produced will help clarify the sequence of cultural innovations in the area and the means by which early modern humans adapted to environmental variation through space and time. <br/>This proposal is appropriate for the NSF High-Risk Research in Anthropology Program because it involves the first exploration of a potentially important but presently unknown area. Though the contents of the rockshelters cannot be predicted, the local abundance of MSA artifacts and the richness of archaeological assemblages recovered from similar shelters in regions to the south render the Knersvlakte highly promising. The intellectual merit of this project derives from the fact that, if it is successful, a new window on MSA variation, and therefore modern human origins, will be opened.<br/>The project will have broader impacts through training and research opportunities for graduate students. If successful, this proposal will form the basis of a multi-year project that will also provide educational experiences for undergraduate students. The information generated about a crucial time in human prehistory will be of general interest, and as such will provide opportunities to engage the public, and especially to spark interest in younger children who will go on to become the scientists of tomorrow. With this in mind, the project's findings and their significance will be communicated through academic outlets, local community lectures and educational outreach programs."

BML?s atmospheric, earth, ocean, and computer scientists partner with science education experts to give graduate students life-long skills in inquiry-based teaching, science content, environmental observing technology, and cyber-infrastructure. Graduate fellows then use their own investigations and training to develop motivational research projects that provide field experiences and access to start-of-the-art sensor networks for middle and high school students. Use of new environmental observing systems and cyber-infrastructure transforms STEM teaching at all academic levels by offering exploration and data-gathering tools for field studies, collaboration, and real and ?virtual? research experiences in classrooms and laboratories. K-12 teachers and students are presented with science role models and opportunities to practice all tasks performed by professional scientists, from creating research questions and collecting data to sharing results at scientific conferences.  <br/>Ocean processes are at the heart of global climate predictions and failing fisheries, but are poorly understood by the general public. Broad ocean literacy is needed to build ocean stewardship, strengthen science literacy, and create a new generation of ocean leaders. CAMEOS builds on national ocean and science literacy initiatives, and broadens participation of under-represented graduate and K-12 students in inquiry-based STEM education.

The specific focus of the project is on abiotic stress combinations and the genetic and metabolic networks that respond to stress combinations such as drought and heat, drought and salinity and salinity and heat. Abiotic stress is the primary cause of crop loss world-wide, with losses in the US estimated at 14-19 billion dollars each year. While abiotic stress is routinely studied in Arabidopsis by applying a single stress condition such as drought, salinity or heat, this type of analysis does not reflect the conditions that occur in the field where crop plants are subjected to a combination of different stresses. The central objective of the project is to identify novel genes, gene networks and metabolic pathways that specifically respond to a combination of two different abiotic stresses. The hypothesis to be tested is that dedicated genes, networks and pathways are activated in plants that are simultaneously exposed to two different stress conditions. This project is designed to bring Arabidopsis into the front line of applied research on abiotic stress tolerance, and bridge the gap between stress studies conducted with Arabidopsis in the lab and the conditions that impact crops in the field. The two key ""Broader Impacts"" of the proposed research are: 1) Development and maintenance of a centralized website that will bring together agronomists, breeders and Arabidopsis molecular biologists (http://www.ag.unr.edu/Stress_Combination/). 2) Educational outreach for K-12 and multidisciplinary training to postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduates trainees. Both undergraduate and K-12 outreach and training activities will target the under privileged and under represented in Science. Historically, abiotic stress combinations, such as drought and heat, had the outmost devastating economical and sociological impacts on the US, with losses of 48.4 and 61.6 billion dollars in 1980 and 1988 respectively. The proposed project will pave the way for the development of crops with enhanced abiotic stress tolerance, contributing to ameliorate the consequences of future weather disasters that are likely to increase in frequency due to anticipated climatic changes.<br/>"

Protein-protein interactions will be analyzed in yeast and in plants to build an interaction network of receptor (NBS-LRR) proteins, plant signaling components, and virulence effector proteins from bacterial and oomycete pathogens. The functional significance of these interactions to disease will be studied by a variety of cell biology and disease assays.  The project will reveal whether targets of effectors represent a limited number of points of weakness in the plant that are exploited by multiple effectors and pathogens and whether protein complexes that determine the infection phenotype co-evolve.  Libraries of genes encoding NBS-LRR proteins and their domains as well as signaling proteins that are candidate plant targets of effectors studied will be distributed through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center.<br/>The global approach will generate large amounts of data that will impact many labs focused on understanding the molecular basis of disease resistance in plants as well as contribute to the functional characterization of numerous genes in Arabidopsis.  Data from the project will be broadly disseminated through the project web site (http://niblrrs.ucdavis.edu ) and through The Arabidopsis Information Resource.  Deciphering the molecular determinants of resistance has practical importance as well as fundamental interest.  A greater understanding of the mechanisms of perception and responses will provide new possibilities for developing disease resistant plants. Consequently, this project will expand the options available to plant breeders to achieve more durable resistance. Researchers involved in the project will benefit from inter-disciplinary training that includes the molecular genetics and cell biology of the defense response components and protein-protein interactions involved in pathogen-host interactions.  Outreach efforts will include dissemination of genomics approaches to high schools through curriculum development, workshops and internships. <br/>"

When attached to proteins (biliproteins), phytobilins harvest light energy to drive photosynthesis in blue-green, red and brown algae, and trigger adaptive signaling pathways vital to survival in a constantly fluctuating light environment. This project focuses on ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases (FDBRs), a family of metal-free radical enzymes that are responsible for the synthesis of phytobilin pigment precursors of both classes of light sensor proteins. Using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques, this research seeks to elucidate FDBR function at the molecular level via a combination of x-ray crystallography, molecular biology and biochemical analysis. Such knowledge is needed for development of activators/inhibitors of FDBRs that can be used to enhance light perception, growth and development of oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms upon which all life on earth depends. These studies also seek to understand the biological role of a unique FDBR gene in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, an oxygenic photosynthetic organism that lacks all known light sensing biliproteins. Using genetic, genomic and phenotypic analyses of this organism, several hypotheses for the function of this gene will be assessed. It is anticipated that such studies will lead to insight into new functions of bilin metabolism hitherto unrecognized. Since Chlamydomonas retains features common to plants and animals, this research is expected not only to yield new avenues to improve crop productivity, but could reveal novel bilin-dependent regulatory pathways of relevance to human/animal physiology and disease. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this research project will integrate research and education by training scientists at all levels (postdocs, graduate, undergraduate and high school students) in the methods of molecular biology, enzymology, protein chemistry, structural biology, computational biology and reverse genetics. Undergraduates (including an underrepresented minority student) will conduct a number of aspects of this research.

This project will forestall a permanent loss of research talent likely to occur if new PhDs are forced to seek employment outside of the field due to the sharp cuts brought about by the recent budget crisis. It will also allow new PhDs to develop experience to make them more effective researchers and/or teachers. In two years, increasing enrollments in both undergraduate and graduate computer science programs may create pent-up demand for hiring at university computer science and related departments. As the economy improves and budget adjustments are made, these departments will try to satisfy this demand for additional faculty. The Computing Research Association, through its Computing Community Consortium, will carry out the project and oversee its management. Together CRA and CCC will track its broader impacts and disseminate its outcomes to the community.<br/>Intellectual Merit: As a nation, we have invested time, energy, and funding in the training of these PhDs. Now, more than ever, we need to find ways to realize a payoff for that investment. The NSF Computing Innovation Fellows (CIF) project will enable this payoff and make it possible for new PhDs to embark on advanced research and teaching careers. The project?s goal is to create a new cadre of researchers, selected by a community process that aggressively balances the often-competing goals of personal development, diversity, and institutional advancement. Because of these diversity goals, CIF may provide a way not only to rescue talent, but also to materially improve the field of computing research and education.<br/>Broader Impact: CIF addresses the Broader Impact goals of the National Science Foundation. The scholars will remain in research positions, enabling them to advance the field while simultaneously gaining an opportunity for further training and learning. The selection process will actively seek applications from women and underrepresented groups; it also will identify scholar candidates from a cross-section of institutions. As a result, we envision that a broad range of host institutions will strengthen their research groups and labs, thereby improving the national infrastructure and research workforce.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>"

The function of such a network is closely related to its structure, which can be disrupted by genetically or environmentally triggered conformational changes to the molecular components, sometimes resulting in disease or other malfunction.  A key weakness of most high-resolution structural techniques for deciphering the network architecture is their inability to determine molecular composition, since they generally lack the sensitivity to identify individual molecules.  Only optical spectroscopy can routinely achieve single-molecule detection, but traditional optical techniques are not sensitive enough to resolve the molecular features of a sample by almost two orders of magnitude. The technical component of this award involves a number of innovative improvements to an emerging high-resolution structural analysis technique called tip-enhanced fluorescence microscopy (TEFM).  TEFM is a near-field optical method whereby the optical intensity of a laser beam is concentrated at the apex (tip) of a sharp needle analogous to a lightning rod.  The  enhanced-intensity region increases the fluorescence rate in the vicinity of the tip, which enables spatial resolution limited only by its sharpness.  TEFM has been used to image individual molecules with ~10 nanometer spatial resolution, and is particularly promising for studying planar samples such as biological membranes.  Several innovations in this project, including a polarization modulation scheme and customized single-photon analysis algorithms, increase TEFM contrast and improve compatibility with soft biological samples.  To increase its versatility, TEFM combines on a single integrated platform with other imaging modalities such as wide-field fluorescence microscopy, confocal microscopy, phase contrast microscopy, total internal fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence correlation microscopy, and fluorescence lifetime microscopy.  Several independent spectral channels are also implemented to enable simultaneous multi-color imaging.  Finally, temperature regulation and closed-loop focus control will be developed for imaging live cell membranes. The instrumentation developed under this award is expected to have broad implications for biological imaging research.  Results will be published in the scientific literature and also on a publicly accessible webpage.  Detailed information will be shared upon request. <br/> The education and outreach component of this award involves the development of an undergraduate integrated science major; mixed-media modules for high-school students and college freshmen on the Physics of various outdoor activities (e.g. skiing, sailing, SCUBA, surfing); and science modules for elementary school students.  These projects are ongoing and the results will be described on a publicly accessible webpage.  Education materials developed under this award will be provided upon request."

Their exotic physical properties due to strong spin-orbit coupling have attracted broad attention in recent years.  The A-site cation in these perovskites does not contribute directly to the electronic states near the Fermi energy. However, as shown in high-Tc cuprates and the magnetoresistive manganites, superconductive transition temperature, the magnetic transition temperature, and the magnetization are highly sensitive to the A-cation disorder as well as the mean A-cation size. The A-cation effect on the physical properties of the 4d and 5d transition-metal oxides has not been studied systematically. Introduction of  A-cation size variance and the change of  mean A-cation size in a wide range is normally limited by the geometric tolerance factor at ambient pressure. A complete study of this subject requires synthesis at pressures as high as  P ~ 20 GPa  in some cases. The high-pressure synthesis with a large volume at P > 20 GPa has been developed in the field of geoscience to study the earth?s lower mantle. However, it remains essentially a virgin field to apply pressure over 10 GPa in a broad range of solid-state synthesis.  This funding will allow the PIs not only to address key factors determining physical properties in the 4d and 5d metal oxides with unquenched orbital angular momentum, but also to explore systematically solid-state synthesis under pressure to 20 GPa. <br/><br/>NON-TECHINICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Perovskite oxides are technically important materials that are widely used in the microelectronic industry, in chemical plants as catalysts, and in solid-state fuel cells as both electrolyte and electrodes. The basic research outlined in this project will lead to a better understanding of perovskite oxides, which in turn benefits greatly their application. <br/>What is unique about the PIs? laboratory is that they have established several sophisticated instruments for material synthesis, characterization, and measurements and they have a long history of emphasis on the relationship between crystal structures, chemistry, their physical properties, and their engineering application. Experimental results are compared directly with theoretical calculations. The PIs emphasize  high-pressure synthesis and crystal growth in the project. These characteristics have attracted scholars around the world to the laboratory. Students, post-docs, and visiting scholars with diversified backgrounds of materials science, chemistry and physics have a chance to interact with each other and to develop their own strategy of material research while working on the project. Visiting researchers have also brought with their specialties developed in their home laboratories. All these factors create a very rich environment for learning and research. In this project, the PIs also collaborate with scientists in Spain, Japan, China and Canada.   <br/>"

As the name suggests,<br/>these closures, which coincide with tight closure in equicharacteristic<br/>p, are based upon the plus closure of an ideal, the set of elements<br/>which are in the extension of the ideal in some integral extension of<br/>the original ring. In the earlier work, a number of properties of these<br/>closures were demonstrated. Most notably, the principal investigator has<br/>demonstrated that the colon-capturing property implies that ideals in<br/>regular rings are closed and also that the colon-capturing property does<br/>in fact hold in dimension three. Hence the Direct Summand Conjecture is<br/>a theorem in dimension three. A key objective of the current project is<br/>to extend these results to dimension four and above. A completely<br/>successful program would establish that one of these extended plus<br/>closures - or a close relative - satisfies all of the requirements<br/>suggested by Huneke for a mixed characteristic analog of tight closure.<br/>It would also determine whether or not three particular rings of<br/>interest are Cohen-Macaulay. The most compelling of the three is the<br/>absolute integral closure of a complete mixed characteristic local<br/>domain of dimension three. For equicharacteristic complete local domains<br/>and all complete local domains of dimension not equal to three, the<br/>answer is already known.<br/><br/>One of the most fundamental subjects in algebra is the understanding of<br/>the concepts of ideals and modules in local rings. For those local<br/>rings which contain a field, the notion of tight closure has evolved as<br/>a way to give a unified presentation - and a simplified one - for many<br/>of the known properties of these objects. As a natural byproduct, it has<br/>led to the discovery of new properties. Understanding of local rings<br/>which do not contain a field has always lagged behind. The principal<br/>investigator has proposed several closely related and promising<br/>candidates to play the role of tight closure in the alternate setting.<br/>These candidates have already led to one significant new result. In this<br/>project, the investigator will continue his efforts to determine which<br/>is the best candidate and to what extent the new closures fill the void."

The America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science (COMPETES) Act requires that proposals to the National Science Foundation (NSF) have a plan to provide appropriate training and oversight in the responsible and ethical conduct of research to undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers participating in the proposed research project (Sec 7009). It further requires that proposals describe in detail the mentoring activities that will be provided for postdoctoral researchers (Sec 7008). While NSF has always encouraged ethical conduct of research, the America COMPETES Act makes this requirement explicit and creates an opportunity to better compile and disseminate ethics research results and related education materials.  Accordingly, this project develops an initial online resource for building a digital library on ethics in science and engineering that NSF intends to support.<br/> <br/>The University of Massachusetts Amherst beta site will be interdisciplinary, multi-media, and international. Current repositories, clearinghouses, and websites that house ethics materials generally focus on one disciplinary field.  The University of Massachusetts beta site repository will be used to examine effective ways to coordinate and present materials from across disciplines, including the social sciences, and will act as a portal to direct faculty, post-doctoral, and graduate researchers to a wide range of ethics resources.  The ability to freely, quickly and easily locate and review materials for use in mentoring, education and training of future generations of scientists and engineers is invaluable. A beta site that compiles selected materials with the objective of making them freely and easily accessible -- while incorporating Web 2.0 and social networking tools to enhance usability and effectiveness -- is the starting point for a digital library for the 21st Century. The beta site uses various media to engage a younger generation of scientists and engineers in ethics issues and to help faculty incorporate ethics concepts into classrooms and labs in an engaging way. Finally, a focus on the international dimensions of ethics will contribute to broad reach given the continuing globalization of scientific and technological research."

Ruoff of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Professor Christopher W. Bielawski of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin.  The Ruoff and Bielawski groups will co-develop new methods to synthesize high performance ultracapacitors based on graphene for applications in electrical energy storage.  In particular, they plan to: (i) develop graphene-based electrode materials for the enhanced performance of ultracapacitors with higher energy and power densities; (ii) characterize the morphologies, structures and properties of materials which can lead to unprecedented ultracapacitance performance; (iii) develop a fundamental understanding of the electrochemical double layer in graphene-based ultracapacitors and of other factors which determine their performance; (iv) investigate the compatibility of ionic liquids as an electrolyte for graphene-based ultracapacitors; and (v) develop new ultracapacitor cell assembly approaches and cell-testing methods.  The relationship between morphology/structure and performance will emerge through the combined efforts of chemical synthesis, processing, characterization, and physical properties measurements.  To meet the state-of-the-art requirement of improving the energy density while lowering the cost of energy storage, fundamental research in the Ruoff and Bielawski laboratories will help to drive the development of graphene-based materials on a large scale and in a cost-effective manner.  The development of a deeper understanding of graphene-based electrochemical capacitance will also provide a meaningful reference for other energy storage devices such as Li-ion batteries.  This fundamental investigation is likely to lead to interesting or novel phenomena in the general field of electrochemistry.  Inherent to the multidisciplinary nature of the proposed research plan, students working on this project will gain experience in a wide range of scientific and engineering concepts and techniques.  Professors Ruoff and Bielawski are actively involved in educational programs that are designed to train undergraduate and graduate students in materials chemistry, carbon science, and engineering.  They will develop complementary lecture and laboratory courses in engineering, chemistry and physics, including the development of energy-related curricula for grades 7-12 in local primary and high schools. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>As a single sheet of graphite, graphene has a number of exceptional properties, including: extraordinary mechanical properties, high thermal conductivity and excellent electrical conductivity.  Combined with its very high specific surface area (for the individual sheet, ~2630 m2/g or about one half of the area of a football field per gram), materials based on graphene are poised to meet the state-of-the-art requirement of improving the energy density and lowering the cost of energy storage in contemporary ultracapacitors.  With this award, the Ruoff and Bielawski groups at UT-Austin will combine their respective strengths and experiences to co-develop a new class of high performance ultracapacitors based on graphene.  They will also develop a fundamental understanding of graphene-based ultracapacitors which will provide a meaningful reference for other energy storage devices, such as Li-ion batteries.  Based on the breakthroughs that are possible in energy storage applications due to the exceptional electrical conductivity and extremely high surface area of graphene, the current technology in use in diverse fields such as the electric power grid, automobiles, and portable electronic devices could be revolutionized.  Fully integrated into these research efforts, the Ruoff and Bielawski groups also have a number of outreach and educational activities planned, including research programs for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, continuous as well as summer research training for high school and undergraduate (including minority) students and high school teachers, additions to course materials being offered both in engineering, chemistry and physics courses, including curriculum development for grades 7-12.  To maximize these efforts, collaborations with a number of local and international companies interested in developing graphene-based ultracapacitors are also planned."

The proposed method comprises two algorithmic components: (1) integral equation solvers for Stokesian flows with dynamic interfaces; and (2) scalable fast multipole algorithms. Why do we need petaflop-scale computing power to tackle this problem? One microliter of blood contains millions of red blood cells(RBCs) and a few hundred thousand platelets. Discretizations with O(100 points/cell and O(1000) time steps result in more than a trillion space-time unknowns. Solving problems of such size will require 50K-core machines.

The hope is that (near its boundary) the associated toric variety carries a canonical universal family of pairs of K3 surface with divisor. The existence of such a family would  naturally generalize the mirror symmetry programs of Kontsevich-Soibelman and Gross-Siebert, and at the same time unifying this work with Thurston's work on triangulations of the 2-sphere, and Looijenga's conjecture on smoothings of cusp singularities.<br/><br/>According to quantum field theory the physical universe is controlled by a so called Calabi-Yau manifold -- a certain kind of geometric object. As a result it is important to understand the set of such objects -- the so called Moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds, and in particular to understand the behavior of this space at infinity, i.e. near its boundary, or equivalently, to understand how Calabi-Yau manifolds can degenerate. One case is well understood: A complex 1-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold is the surface of a doughnut, and as one moves to the boundary of the moduli space, one loop on the doughnut shrinks, the limiting point on the boundary of the moduli space corresponds to crushing this loop to a point -- which yields the space you obtain by taking a real 2 dimensional sphere and bending it until two points touch each other. The goal of the project is to understand what happens in the next higher dimension, complex dimension two, and thus to describe the boundary behavior of the moduli space of so called K3 surfaces."

Notably, this program continues to be comprised of roughly 60% under-represented minority group students and about 70% female students; a majority of the REU participants go on to graduate programs.<br/>The intellectual merit of this REU Site is the academic and ethical development of junior social science scholars around a topic of immense importance to the future of the United States. The PIs seek to provide the REU students with (1) exposure, (2) experience, and (3) expertise. Specifically, they want to expose undergraduates to both the technical tools and professional culture of social science, and to do that through the scientific course of inquiry in social demography. The PIs want the REU students to experience the rigorous course of study and intensity of the scientific research process firsthand. Additionally, they want these students to demonstrate their expertise as junior members of the academy. To accomplish these goals, the Pis have developed precise program objectives.<br/>To begin with, they expose the REU students to social demography via formal course work and seminars. An undergraduate sociology course, Analytic Demography, comprises the heart of the first one-half of the summer at our REU site. In addition, they conduct a series of professionalization workshops, or ?proseminars,? which the REU Site Director and Co-Director hold during the summer. In these proseminars, REU students discuss issues ranging from getting into and paying for graduate school to the myriad ethical issues that demographers and other social scientists confront in conducting their work.<br/>Our students will gain concrete experience in three ways. First, the formal course focuses on the methods and materials of demographic research, with an emphasis on the demography of minority groups. Second, the related Stata programming lab provides students with an introduction to statistical analysis and computer literacy to gain competence in the analysis of population-based data sets. Third, the students will experience an intense mentored research relationship with Population Research Center (PRC) graduate students and faculty affiliates. The REU students will be expected to produce, at the end of the summer, a stand-alone ?deliverable? in the form of a scholarly paper, and have much support in doing so.<br/><br/>Finally, the REU students will demonstrate their expertise at the end of this program in two ways. First, the students will present their research work at the end of the summer to a group of PRC faculty affiliates and graduate students. Second, each of our students will be funded to present his or her REU research paper at the annual meeting of the Southern Demographic Association (SDA) in the fall following the close of the summer program. The SDA has dedicated two sessions each year to the REU alumni in the past, has been very welcoming of these students, and will be asked to do so again.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this program is to influence the future of higher education in the social sciences, with special attention to the racial/ethnic and gender diversity of the future academic workforce. This REU site program aims to influence the continued development of both sociology and demography as fields by helping to train the next generation of population scholars in a rigorous, ethical, and multi-racial/ethnic context."

The US PIs are Dr. Elizabeth Catlos, Dr. Estella Atekwana and Dr. Ibrahim Cemen, Department of Geology, Oklahoma State University (OSU), Stillwater, Oklahoma.  The foreign collaborators are Dr. Cemal Goncuoglu, Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara and Dr. Mete Hancer, Pamukkale University, Denizli, Turkey.   Since 2005, the PI has been conducting NSF-supported research in western Turkey in collaboration with co-PI Cemen and with Dr. Cemal Goncuoglu at Middle East Technical University and Dr. Mete Hancer, Pamukkale University. The collaborative efforts have centered on field and geochemical studies of the Menderes Massif in western Turkey. Two Master's level graduate students from OSU have participated in the project and have conducted intensive field work and training in Turkey.  In this project the PIs will take advantage of ongoing research activities and the expertise of a new OSU faculty member (Atekwana) to provide research and training opportunities for 9 US students (6 undergraduates and 3 graduate students).  The proposal will focus on the teaching and training of students that are traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields.  Over three years, these students will partner with peers at METU and Pamukkale University to conduct field-based research within a multidisciplinary framework focused on investigating the dynamics of extension within the Earth's lithosphere. The goal is to provide talented and motivated US students with hands-on field experience in geophysical surveying, field mapping, GPS mapping, sampling, as well as the tools necessary to make geochemical and petrologic observations.  <br/>Intellectual merits: The scientific focus of this proposal is to develop a better understanding of the creation and evolution of the planet's largest metamorphic core complex, the Menderes Massif. The mechanism(s) that created extension in this region, and, consequently, how the Menderes Massif relates to other extensional domains in the Aegean Region is unclear. The tectonic history of this large and fundamental component of the Aegean is important, as it lends considerable insight into the large-scale processes that control and facilitate extension of the Earth's lithosphere. Proposed models for the creation of the massif include subduction roll-back, orogenic collapse, and extrusiontectonics. These concepts are often discussed in a variety of Geoscience courses. The topic of lithospheric extension is also a subject of current investigation and active discussion by numerous researchers in the field and laboratory as evidenced by recent NSF and Geological Society of America workshops.<br/>Broader Impacts: This project integrates field and geochemical research activities into the education of OSU undergraduate and graduate students. The proposal is geared towards students who are underrepresented in the Physical Sciences. The PI will partner with researchers and educators in OSU's relevant ""diversity"" offices to recruit and fund students.  The project will provide access and support for the OSU Electron Microprobe and the UCLA Ion Microprobe Laboratory. The OSU and UCLA labs are sites of research and mentoring for a large number of students. Students will be encouraged to present the results of their research at professional meetings, including those geared towards advancing minority participation. With the Middle East likely to become one of the most crucial regional arenas for U.S. foreign policy in the coming years, and with Turkey singled out as a key country where the training pipeline should be expanded at every level, this project provides benefits by developing international partnerships and improving the Turkish language skills of US students.

The main goal is to sample the sky on timescales less than one minute, to determine if new phenomena exist which have heretofore gone unnoticed because of low temporal sampling.  This trial will determine the optimal temporal cadence to detect both short period and long period phenomena, and provide accurate statistics correlating magnitude range with detection limits so as to optimize exposure times.  Since it is likely this survey will discover many new variable stars of known types, it is important to understand the temporal and brightness variation limits of the equipment and of any data.<br/><br/>Although this study will extend our knowledge of the physical properties of known variable types, the most exciting prospect is the chance to uncover new, previously unknown phenomena.  A survey of this sort will naturally uncover many types of mostly stellar variability, and all data for these stars will be available on-line, so that interested astronomers can perform their own studies.  Undergraduate students (supported from other funds) will take part in obtaining, reducing, and analyzing the data.  They will also be involved in establishing the reduction and analysis procedures and correlating with known variable stars.

Lovinger	07/31/2011	"$244,000.00"		benjamin.hsiao@stonybrook.edu	WEST 5510 FRK MEL LIB	Stony Brook	NY	117940001	6316329949	MPS	1773	"9161, AMPP"	$0.00	"TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>The proposed research aims to investigate several newly discovered phenomena of orientation-induced crystallization precursor structures in multi-component polymer melts under flow.  The phenomena include (1) formation of precursor structures at both nanoscopic and macroscopic scales, which can act as multi-scaled scaffolds to guide the crystallization process, and (2) the relationships among the flow-induced precursor structures, rheological behavior, multi-component phase behavior and type of flow field. To tackle the proposed problems, following research plans have been composed.  First, the chosen multi-component systems, all based on polyolefin will include polymer blends of model compounds (e.g. high molecular weight crystallizable species and low molecular weight non-crystallization species), segmental olefin block copolymers (with only one crystallizable block) and polyolefin nanocomposites with well dispersed surface-modified carbon nanofibers/nanotubes. Second, to understand the rheological behavior, experimental data in dynamic and transient modes will be described by a GEX-based model in order to yield relaxation mechanisms responsible for the formation of precursor structure.  Third, the development of structure in real time will be following by the use of combined methods including rheology, in-situ synchrotron small-angle-X-ray scattering (SAXS), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and light scattering techniques.  Finally, to understand the effect of different flow fields, results from simple shear (containing the rotational element) and extensional flow (without the rotational element) will be compared.<br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>The subject of flow-induced crystallization, especially in multi-component systems such as polymer blends, block copolymers and nanocomposites, remains to be one of the most important problems in polymer science and engineering today. With the availability of synchrotron X-ray scattering and diffraction methods, and the coupling of rheology and light scattering techniques, many unanswered questions of fundamental importance can now be suitably addressed. It is known that molecular orientation induced by flow during polymer processing operations can deeply affect the crystallization kinetics as well as the final polymer morphology and properties. The knowledge obtained in the proposed study will significantly enhance our ability to understand the relationships between structure, phase behavior, process and property in multi-component systems containing crystalline components.  The information will lead to developments of improved polymer processes and new polymer products, thus benefiting the polymer industry in specific and the society in general.  <br/>The broader impacts of this proposal are several.  The immediate benefit is that the proposed activities will produce tight links between academic and government institutions (i.e., Stony Brook University, National Synchrotron Light Source). Students and scientists will be trained in both institutions and receive interdisciplinary research experiences. They will be exposed to relevant industrial problems and will have a chance to tackle these problems with direct interactions from industrial scientists.  They will also be involved in the Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory summer research programs, where they will supervise high school and undergraduate students as well as industrial scientists to carry out synchrotron X-ray experiments and related in-laboratory studies.<br/>"

Statistical methods which are robust over the class of elliptical distributions are more widely applicable than methods based solely on the multivariate normal distribution. The class of elliptical distributions, though, represents only a small class of  multivariate models. Important cases which do not fall within this class are mixture models and independent components models. Affine equivariance is a useful property since methods possessing it behave equally well over different covariance structures. However, there are many cases where interest lies in certain type of covariance structures, e.g. factor analysis models. The investigator's research goals are thus two-fold. First, the investigator is to further develop and study ""invariant coordinate selection."" This is a new multivariate method, recently introduced by the investigator, which is well suited for exploring non-elliptical models. In particular, it can be used to uncover Fisher's linear discriminant subspace for mixture models when the group identifications are unknown, and can be use to uncover the independent components in independent components models. Second, the investigator is to study the properties of certain non-affine equivariant methods, such as orthogonal equivariant M-estimates. The primary goal here is to achieve a better understanding of the type of covariance structures for which such methods may or may not be advantageous.<br/><br/>The need to analyze multivariate data arises in many diverse disciplines, such as computer science, psychology, meteorology, sociology, biology, econometrics and engineering. The primary interest in such data typically is not with an understanding of each variable separately, but rather with the interrelationships among the variables or with unmeasurable ""latent"" variables. Many common methods employed in these areas are based upon the multivariate normal model, which are now well known to perform poorly if the normal model does not hold. In particular, only a few errors in the data or a slight deviation in the model can highly influence the interpretation of an experiment or a data set, sometimes with disastrous consequences. This is particularly problematic with high dimensional data, i.e. data consisting of many variables, since bad data points or deviations from the model can be difficult to detect whenever they are associated not with just one variable but with a number of the variables. Thus, multivariate methods which are not greatly affected by such problems are crucial to a proper analysis of such data. The investigator anticipates that the intended research will have an important impact not only on steering the direction of research within robust statistics, but also on the methodology used within the many disciplines that routinely deal with multivariate data."

Utilizing two model math and science teacher preparation programs, TNT is providing coordinated financial support, mentoring, and a shared learning community to 80 new and aspiring teachers at opposite ends of their careers - undergraduate math and science majors and mid-career and retired STEM professionals. The first program, TUteach, includes undergraduate math and science majors who are simultaneously pursuing secondary (7-12 grade) math or science teacher certification in an accelerated 4-year program. Noyce scholars, a total of 40 over the 5 years of the award, receive financial support to participate in TNT for 1 year, obligating them to teach in a high-need district for at least 2 years. The second, E=mc2, is a 1-year program that prepares mid-career and early retiree STEM professionals for teaching math or science in the middle grades (4-8). E=mc2 participants who receive Noyce stipends (a total of 40) are obligated to teach in one of the high-need, partner districts for 3 years. Both programs feature closely integrated course work and field-based teaching experiences in urban classrooms, and mentoring by experienced teachers. For TUteach participants, exposure to and practice in urban classrooms begins in the freshman year. The program is fostering communities of practice with face-to-face and on-line supports; the communities incorporate master teachers who facilitate school-based meetings and conduct formal observations of, and conferences with each new teacher. They in turn are supported by TUteach faculty mentors and E=mc2 mentor teachers. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The TNT is preparing 80 high-quality, Pennsylvania-certified, middle-grades and secondary math and science teachers to teach rigorous math and science content through innovative, inquiry-driven approaches in urban school contexts. As it brings these new approaches to the training and support of new teachers, TNT is also heightening general awareness of the need for high-quality math and science teachers in high-poverty, high-minority, low-performing schools. Project evaluation is contributing to the larger knowledge base about replicable models for effective recruitment, development and retention of math and science teachers for urban schools. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Temple University, with its diverse faculty and student body, is one of the largest preparers of teachers in its region, and has an established reputation for developing innovative approaches. The broader impacts promise to be significant with respect to both the number and quality of teachers, particularly those from under-represented groups, who are trained in high-need subjects for high-need schools."

This proposal aims to develop a fundamental understanding of the origins of the unusual mechanical properties of calcium carbonate biominerals and to reproduce the extraordinary mechanical properties of nacre in computer simulation as a direct result of its architecture and essential composition.  This research  will (1) establish a simulation tool that predicts the mechanical properties of biominerals from constituent molecules to millimeter-sized specimens, (2) determine the essential molecular structure and function of the organic interfaces that link the multi-level structures of nacre, (3) establish the precise nature of the effect of the hierarchical architecture as well as the organic interfaces on the mechanical properties of calcium carbonate biominerals, and (4) develop a fundamental understanding of the multiscale mechanics of hierarchically-structured composite materials.<br/><br/>Success in reproducing the mechanical properties of biominerals in simulations, hence in understanding the mechanisms that give rise to the remarkable mechanical properties of biominerals, will lead to the development of next generation high-strength high-toughness ceramics. Success of this research will also stimulate students? interest in mechanics and mechanical engineering through the fascinating biological world.  The research project will involve a diversity of students including female and minority students, undergraduate and graduate students, and will provide these students with an unparalleled opportunity to gain knowledge and to develop skills in an interdisciplinary research area. Computer models and codes developed will be posted for public use and for feedback. Research results will be published in journals and on the internet, and will be presented at conferences, seminars and workshops.<br/><br/><br/>"

A novel mechanistic model of the nanoscratch test is derived using a synergetic approach of both analytical and empirical processes based on the assumption that a failure flow occurs along the shear planes in front of the sliding tip during the scratch process.  The efficacy of this method in detecting the local resistance of bone tissues to failure (toughness) is verified using bone specimens with known fragility.  Deliverables include a mechanistic model of scratch process, testing procedures and associated techniques, experimental validation of the test methodology, documentation of research results, engineering education and research experiences for students from high school to graduate levels.<br/><br/>If successful, this unique methodology will enable direct, quantitative, and minimal destructive measurements of in situ failure behavior of bone or other materials alike, thus facilitating the development of physically sound constitutive models of these materials at ultrastructural levels and the applications in the field of materials and biomedical research.  In addition to bone research, other potential applications of this methodology include the characterization of biomaterials in tissue engineering, thus giving rise to great potential for advancement towards improved treatments of congenital diseases, traumatic injuries, and degenerative processes of bone tissues.  The results will be disseminated to allow for adding new functions to the existing nanotechnology in materials characterization.  As a broad educational component of this project, the comprehensive research program will benefit graduate, undergraduate, and high school students with integrated training opportunities in materials science, biomechanics, and nanotechnology in both classroom and research labs.<br/><br/>"

Although platforms capable of making rapid physical and chemical measurements are robust and commercially available, the design, fabrication, and deployment of autonomous sensors capable of making even modest biological measurements are in their infancy. While a number of biological sensors based on molecular analysis have been field deployed, these systems are inherently complex and have high production and running costs, and are limited in the number of assays they can perform. Additionally, these systems have  complex operational procedures for system set up, deployment, and retrieval, and as such there is a low likelihood that in their current stage of development they will be broadly adopted. To address these existing limitations, a small autonomous in situ sampling and archival device is being developed. The Sample Filtration and Archiving (SaFA) system can be deployed in the aquatic environment where it will automatically collect and filter between 20-30 user defined time-stamped water samples of between 200-500 ml. Preservation of the genetic material in the captured biological material is performed by the subsequent addition of a stabilization buffer, making it available for downstream <br/>interrogation in the laboratory using a range of molecular biological techniques upon retrieval. The SaFA instrument will therefore enable autonomous sample collection and archiving at high temporal resolution, for subsequent laboratory analysis. The SaFA will also allow increased sampling regimes to be performed in situ without the need for personnel to be deployed in the field, particularly during dangerous or inconvenient sampling periods, thereby increasing the resolution and scope of current microbial ecology studies. This multidisciplinary project will assist in the training and support of a <br/>masters student at UPRM. The project will also support 2 summer engineering undergraduate students who will develop the electrical subsystems and package the instrument. We will also develop K-12 external outreach programs in both Puerto Rico and Wisconsin that address molecular biology and in situ instrumentation applications. Following utility studies by the PIs, microbial ecologists affiliated of the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) initiative, will have access to the prototype versions of the SaFA for evaluation purposes. To enable broad integration into the aquatic sciences the instrument will be ?open source? as all information relating to the construction and operation of the SaFA system will be download-able via a web site. <br/>"

Dr. Ma proposes to use the fruit fly Drosophila as a model organism to study developmental robustness.  Since the fundamental principles that guide developmental processes are conserved in all animals, the findings of this study will be directly relevant to the understanding of ourselves.  This study will focus on a gradient protein called Bicoid that instructs the embryo to develop the anterior structures including the head and thorax.  Dr. Ma will investigate the processes of both Bicoid gradient formation and gradient action in embryos, with a focus on the robustness of the system.  He has assembled an interdisciplinary team to tackle this problem and will take advantage of tools in genetics, molecular biology, mathematics, computer science and physics.  Dr. Ma aims to obtain experimental data to build a mathematical model that describes developmental robustness.  The information revealed in this study will be useful not only to developmental and systems biologists but also to physicists and mathematicians working on living systems.

To what extent is Great Basin extension driven internally by gravitational collapse? How do the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin interact? What is the role of the Sierra Nevada in controlling collapse and extension of the Great Basin?  These questions are central to the mission of the EarthScope Program, as they represent key parts to the puzzle of how the Pacific-North America plate boundary is evolving, and what processes are responsible. Yet, despite recent advances in geodesy, we still do not have answers to simple questions that any schoolchild might ask: ""How fast is the Sierra Nevada going up today?""; ""Is the Great Basin going up or down?""<br/><br/>To address these questions, this 3-year project will accurately characterize uplift and collapse in the Sierra Nevada - Great Basin region by exploiting high precision GPS data from EarthScope's Plate Boundary Observatory to measure vertical motion of the Earth's crust. These measurements will provide crucial first-order evidence on the underlying processes. Measuring vertical motion is important because it indicates the flux of potential energy, a fundamental characteristic of tectonic/mantle dynamic processes, including isostasy, orogeny (mountain building), gravitational collapse, and mantle upwelling. <br/>To make the vertical GPS data physically meaningful, methods are being implemented that will accurately reference the changes in surface height to the center of the Earth (the Earth center of mass).  In order to reduce the errors in vertical rates to a useful level (sub-millimeter per year), the investigators are making use of several recent advances in GPS observable modeling, including global-scale ambiguity resolution, absolute antenna calibrations, satellite transmitter phase center variations, the modeling of non-gravitational forces on the GPS satellites, and atmospheric refraction. Once an accurate time series of vertical position is derived for each GPS station, the spatial and temporal patterns of vertical variations are then interpreted in terms of both the tectonic processes of interest, as well as non-tectonic effects (such as atmospheric pressure loading and hydrological effects).<br/><br/>The primary data set for this project is being acquired by the specially designed ""PBO Transect"" of densely-spaced GPS stations, spanning east-west the entire Great Basin and Sierra Nevada range at latitude 39º-40º, together with the more broadly spaced PBO network covering the Pacific-North American plate boundary and beyond. In addition, the University of Nevada, Reno, has since 2004 built and operated the ~300-station ""MAGNET"" semi-continuous GPS network, which provides data for this project. Although the measurements from MAGNET are not continuous all of the time, pilot studies show that they can accurately track seasonal and secular change in GPS station height; thus MAGNET complements the continuous PBO measurements by providing much more spatial detail to the complex patterns of vertical motions.  By the end of this project (mid-2012), pilot studies predict that vertical velocities for most GPS stations have an accuracy of <0.5 mm/yr, at a level that is useful for scientific interpretation, and toward answering the project's research questions."

The system will also have high temporal resolution down to 0.5 ms enabling the observation of rapidly occurring flow events and behavioral reactions. Two state-of-the-art velocimetry techniques will be integrated to resolve the wide range of spatial scales. Holographic velocimetry will quantify small-scale motion of organisms, microscopic appendages, and the surrounding fluid (scales 1-100 micrometer). Simultaneously, tomographic velocimetry will capture and quantify larger scales (300 micrometer- 10 cm) of motion in the volume surrounding one or multiple organisms. The system will operate in a spectral range (near-infrared) to which fish and plankton are insensitive so that the measurement system will not affect or bias their behavior. The measurements obtained from the proposed instrument would provide unprecedented quantitative observational capabilities in both spatial and temporal domains. The instrumentation will permit the study of predator-prey interactions among fish, zooplankton, ciliates, dinoflagellates, and bacteria simultaneously within realistic environments. Therefore the data captured by such a system will provide opportunities to transform understanding of interactive behavior in aquatic environments.

The energy is needed in cities on the costs and the wind blows more steadily off shore. Wind turbines placed in shallow ocean water on rigid platforms do however raise environmental concerns and may degrade the natural beauty of beaches and coastlines.   These concerns often lead to significant delays in construction and installation. Floating, far-offshore wind turbines, located farther from land in deep water, would eliminate these environmental concerns, while at the same time tapping into even greater wind power potential.<br/>While the potential for floating wind turbines is vast, they pose major engineering challenges. Not only must the turbines be stable and structurally sound when forced by large ocean waves, they must also be economical to build.  The present study will develop integrated computer simulations and physical experiments to advance the state-of-the-art in modeling of floating wind turbines located in deep ocean water. The results will help us understand how such platforms behave, thus making it possible to design economical wind turbines. <br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to lay the foundation for understanding how floating platforms behave by developing numerical simulations with sufficient accuracy for the early design stages where the overall character of the system are established. In effect we will develop a ""numerical"" offshore water tank, and then validate the numerical simulations with physical experiments. <br/>The broader impact of the proposed activity is that it advances the nation's capabilities in a new renewable energy technology by developing multi-scale computational tools and physical experiments to model a complex system subject to extreme environmental loads. The need for multiscale modeling capability is needed in a broad range of applications and the success of the present project will have wide impact for related problems."

The proposed work focuses on experimental design of ill-posed inverse problems; a field that has not received sufficient attention in the inverse problems community where the focus is usually on the analysis of the inverse problem given the data. Obviously, this already imposes restrictions on the quality of the possible solutions.   On the other hand, the objective of the funded work is the study of an  important pre-data acquisition question: How should the experiment be conducted to obtain optimal data given the physical constraints and available resources? Solutions to this question require techniques from numerical optimization, statistics and inverse problem theory. In particular, the problem of experimental design can be cast as a bilevel optimization problem that consists of two nested optimization problems. The proposed work is a study of design criteria and new numerical algorithms for the solution of the bilevel optimization problems that arise from them.<br/><br/><br/>This work  will address the fundamental question of experimental design of   ill-posed inverse problems. Such problems arise in the design of any practical experiment  or instrumentation from geophysical  and medical imaging to the  production of better vision systems. This work will develop new criteria for the design and development of new algorithms that will enable its numerical implementation. The results of the research will be applied to electromagnetic imaging, a field that is  routinely used in geophysics and medical physics. <br/>It will lead to better experiments that yield better images and as such, will assist in  the decision making of geoscientists and and physicians.<br/><br/>"

These are expected to play an ever-growing role in meeting our energy needs. In large part, progress is due to fabrication of structures at the nano-scale: improved electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction, low-dimensional thermoelectric materials, and highly conductive olivine materials used in advanced rechargeable batteries for instance. In order for these devices to impact the energy challenge, they must be affordable-a critical aspect of which is their long-term stability in service-a fundamental issue for nanostructures. Georgia Institute of Technology will investigate the structure and function of materials and use physics-based modeling to elucidate the ageing mechanisms of nanoscale catalysts. Fundamental questions about the surface energy of nanometer sized particles will be addressed and the results integrated into physics-based models of catalyst ageing. From a detailed mechanistic understanding of failure mechanisms, the broader objectives of the work are to guide the development of new materials and to identify strategies to mitigate these failure modes in full systems.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The number of vehicles in the world is approaching 1 billion, and these contribute about 20 percent of the anthropogenic emissions of CO2. What's more, nearly all of these vehicles are powered with petroleum. Fuel cells and advanced lithium batteries show great promise as a future power sources. Both require electrodes with features with nanometer dimensions to improve kinetics, but whose structures can also be unstable. As a result of this, cost and durability are barriers that must be eliminated before these technologies are found in wide use commercially. A systematic framework will be developed to rigorously account for durability of electrochemical systems that can be generalized to ageing of catalysts and to other nano-scale devices. The program will provide graduate training and promote extensive interaction with industry. In addition to disseminating the results of this proposed research through publications and presentations, educational and outreach activities are integrated into the project. Outreach will be done through the LEAD program for ENGINEERS®, summer programs with Morehouse College and local high schools with a high percentage of under-representative and low income students."

Hass--Thompson--Thurston and independently Bachman provided examples of a manifold with two distinct Heegaard splitting whose lowest genus common stabilization had genus equal to the sum of the two genera, resolving a long standing question. Another striking development is the proof by Qui and Scharlemann of the Gordon conjecture showing that the sum of two Heegaard splittings is stabilized if and only if one of the original Heegaard splittings was stabilized. Kroneheimer and Mrowka used the connection between contact structures on a 3-manifold and the induced symplectic structure on certain related 4-manifolds to prove Property $P$. Yi Ni used the connection between Heegaard Floer homology and sutured manifolds in his proof of the fibered knot conjecture. All of these results are very new and the techniques used are likely to open the doors to many other long standing problems in low dimensional topology. The goal of this conference is to disseminate these ideas, and in particular to introduce junior topologists to these new developments.<br/><br/>Low dimensional topology studies the structure of 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds. These are objects that locally look like 3 and 4 dimensional balls. Many physical objects of interest to other sciences can be studied via techniques stemming from low dimensional topology.

Partly because of its wide applications low dimensional topology has attracted the attention of many mathematicians and new discoveries are being made at breathtaking pace.

Mutel of the University of Iowa and his students will undertake a research program to image the radio coronae of several active late-type binary stars at multiple epochs with unprecedented sensitivity, angular resolution, and positional accuracy. The systems will be imaged using the High Sensitivity Array (HSA), the world's most powerful radio imaging long-baseline array. The program will combine the imaging power of the HSA with observational strategies that optimize positional accuracy, allowing registration of the component star positions on the radio maps with an absolute accuracy approximately one stellar radius. These images will reveal, for the first time, the relationship between extended radio coronae and the parent star system: Whether the radio emission originates on a single star or is generated in the inter-binary region, whether large-scale coronal loops exist, and if radio flares arise near the stellar surface or perhaps at the top of loops.  In addition to stellar astrophysical results, fundamental parameters such as distance, proper motion, and binary orbital orientation will be determined with an accuracy significantly better than current ground- or space-based optical surveys. The multi-epoch HSA radio maps will allow the first detailed, systematic determination of the morphology of the radio coronae of late-type active stars. This is vital in testing existing models of stellar coronae, which are largely based on spectral measurements of the integrated radio and/or x-ray corona, with little or no spatial information. One key test will be to resolve competing hypotheses of radio coronal geometry, such as polar models, dipole traps, and accretion disk-driven inter-binary emission regions. Another will be to establish whether large-scale magnetic loops or other structures are a common feature in active stellar coronae, and if so, to establish their sizes and temporal evolution.<br/><br/>High-fidelity radio maps, combined with accurate overlaid stellar positions, will significantly guide development of comprehensive models of stellar coronae which incorporate x-ray, optical, and UV observations in a unified theoretical framework. Also, since the target stars are all optically bright, the ability to measure stellar radio positions with high accuracy will be very useful in tying the optical and radio coordinate frames together with sub-milliarcsecond precision. This is a long-standing goal vital to many astrophysical disciplines, including future astrometric space missions such as Gaia and PlanetQuest."

In particular case this includes the cones defined by Klyachko inequalities. For the semi-invariants of quivers with relations the main problem is to characterize the finite type and tame quivers with relations in terms of semi-invariants. Another aspect is the connection of quiver representations and cluster algebras. The principal investigator plans to study quivers with potential and the mutations of related Jacobian algebras. He also plans to study the connection of certain sphere triangulations and the Igusa-Orr theory of pictures related to nilpotent groups. The second part is devoted to studying defining ideals of equivariant varieties. Several types of varieties are proposed: orbit closures for representations with finitely many orbits, tangential and secant varieties of orbits of highest weight vectors, and orbit closures for Dynkin quivers corresponding to Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian. The third part involves problems related to Boij-Soderberg conjectures for Betti tables of graded modules.

The conventional method for increasing wear resistance of UHMWPE components of total joint replacements is crosslinking UHMWPE material by irradiation followed by re-melting. These methods have resulted in severe problems such as reduced fatigue strength and toughness, as well as the generation of wear debris in the most biologically active size range, raising concerns of osteolysis, bone resorption, and implant loosening. This project aims at solving those problems through studies of nano-mechanics and bio-tribological modeling for durable UHMWPE nanocomposites reinforced by newly developed graphitic nanomaterials.

In particular, the research focuses on the application of the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, developed by the PI in 1992, to several relevant problems of strongly correlated electrons. This method is one of the most reliable and now widely used techniques to treat strong correlations and quantum systems, and has been extended to several other areas in materials theory.  The study of strong correlation effects in low dimensional systems is one of the most exciting areas in condensed matter physics. These systems exhibit a wide range of behavior, such as high temperature superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, striped, and spin liquid phases.  Numerical simulation techniques have become increasingly necessary to understand these systems, as the systems have strong coupling terms and competition between different types of order. <br/><br/>This research will develop improved methods for describing transport and consequently being able to compare theory with experiment.  For example, recent breakthroughs in real-time DMRG will allow the study of spectral functions for a variety of chain, ladder, and small 2D cluster systems.  The PI anticipates being able to calculate temperature-dependent dynamical properties of 2D copper-oxygen plane models which can be compared directly with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments.  The development of methods for simulating 2D doped and frustrated systems will also be pursued, using both traditional 2D DMRG ""wide ladders"" and novel algorithms based on tensor networks.  Two-dimensional models for cuprate superconductors and recently discovered Fe-superconductors will be studied using large 2D clusters.<br/><br/>Another important component of this research will be the development of a general purpose software library for matrix computations used within DMRG simulations, which will be made freely available to other researchers.<br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This grant supports primarily computational research on the properties of strongly interacting systems of electrons in one- and two-dimensions, with particular application to nanodevices and superconducting materials.  The behavior of electrons when they are confined in these small spaces and when they are very close to each other can lead to novel effects.  This grant supports work that will develop computational techniques to describe these effects.  In addition to discovering and understanding novel properties, which may lead to new devices, the computational techniques developed will find wide application in other fields of study.  This is the power of developing computational methods in one field that can be applied to many other applications.  Students involved in this research will receive excellent training in condensed matter physics and computational physics."

The two a priori disparate fields of low dimensional topology and quantum geometry have recently been related through the involvement of categorical methods.  <br/>Exciting progress has been recently made in each of these subjects independently, including the Weinstein conjecture in dimension three and Donaldson-Thomas/Gromov-Witten duality for all toric threefolds.  <br/>Important open questions motivate continued study; these include the general Weinstein conjecture, and the trilogy of equivalences between Gromov-Witten theory, Donaldson-Thomas theory and Pandharipande-Thomas theory. Central to our symposium, these fields have recently been related through their use of derived categories and categorification.  <br/>This includes the categorification of Khovanov and its many generalizations, the categorification of Donaldson-Thomas theory by Behrend and Joyce-Song and the derived categories of Pandharipande- Thomas theory. In addition, the program of Cautis and Kamnitzer shows categorification results in topology may be recast in some instances as isomorphisms of derived categories in algebraic geometry. The speakers at this symposium will announce accomplishments and also discuss new directions of research. Specifically, Renzo Cavalieri will discuss derived categories in GW and DT theories, Emille Davie will discuss applications to low dimensional topology, and Juan Ortiz- Navaro will discuss categorification, Khovanov homology and its generalizations.<br/><br/>This symposium will enable and encourage students and other scientists to pursue research in areas related to the interaction of quantum geometry and topology, provide the opportunity for scientists to interact and foster collaboration and new research, and disseminate knowledge to a wide and extraordinarily diverse audience. While the reasons for organizing a scienti&#64257;c symposium on topology and quantum geometry are many, there is additionally an acute need to do so for an audience of underrepresented minorities. There is at this time signi&#64257;cant underrepresentation of minorities in the mathematical sciences; this underrepresentation is evidently severe in both topology and quantum geometry and certainly the intersection of these subjects. There are very important questions that need to be addressed in these subjects, and it is necessary to attract a broad and diverse audience to work on these problems. Gromov-Witten theory and related fields have been extremely successful in solving outstanding problems, some over 100 years old, in several branches of mathematics and physics. Low dimensional topology is not only of basic importance in geometry and topology, but in several areas of applied mathematics as well, as highlighted in this symposium. It is predicted that underrepresented minorities will become the majority of United States Citizens in the not so distant future; as such, it is in the long term interest of topology and quantum geometry to have increased participation from members of these groups. Moreover, given the importance of these subjects to mathematics and science in general, it is in our national interest to work against the underrepresentation of minorities conducting research in these &#64257;elds.<br/>"

Gao studies the structures of large Polish groups such as Graev metric groups and the isometry group of the universal Urysohn space. In this project both the problem of surjectively universal Polish groups and the notion of group involvement will be studied. Another objective of the project concerns countable group actions that are likely to generate hyperfinite equivalence relations. For this objective Gao and Jackson will work collaboratively. The focus will be on universal actions of countable solvable groups. For applications of invariant descriptive set theory the PI proposes to study the uniform  classification problem for separable Banach spaces as a part of the current project. This involves further collaborations with other experts in Banach space theory.<br/><br/>Invariant descriptive set theory is a structural complexity theory for equivalence relations arising in logic and mathematics. Many significant problems in mathematics ask for satisfactory classification of mathematical objects. These classification problems can be viewed as equivalence relations, allowing the framework of invariant descriptive set theory to be applied. In the recent years invariant descriptive set theory has been greatly advanced and successfully applied to obtain an understanding of the complexity of many meaningful mathematical classification problems. This project seeks further development of the theory and its applications. The topics investigated in this project are interdisciplinary and bring together concepts, methods, and techniques from different areas of mathematics and logic.<br/><br/>"

The award is made to the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) for the construction of the Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV) based on the approval to proceed received from the National Science Board in March 2009.  Delivery of the vessel is anticipated in mid-2013 with science operations beginning in 2014.<br/><br/>Technical Description:  The 242-foot Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV) will be a multipurpose research ship that will dramatically improve access to Arctic waters and expand current scientific capabilities in the region.  It is designed specifically to operate in seasonal sea ice and open ocean waters near Alaska; including the Chukchi, Beaufort, and Bering Seas as well as the eastern Arctic.  To do so, the hull will be ice-strengthened to American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) ice classification standards.  The ARRV will provide a much needed, technologically-advanced oceanographic platform to enable multidisciplinary teams to conduct field research at the ice edge and in seasonal sea ice up to 3.9 feet thick.  The ARRV will have many advanced capabilities including next-generation science handling systems to improve safety and efficiency at sea, and a modern suite of satellite communications to link the ship to educational facilities ashore.  It is designed to have a minimal influence on its own environment, including low underwater radiated noise (URN) for fisheries and acoustics research, and reduced stack emissions to enable atmospheric research.  With twenty six dedicated science berths, the ARRV will be able to accommodate over 500 researchers and students annually and spend as many as 300 days at sea.  The anticipated operational lifetime of the ARRV is at least 30 years.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The Alaska coastline is longer than that of the contiguous forty eight states combined, and the area of its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is approximately two thirds of the total US EEZ.  The Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska sustain more than half of the total annual national fish catch. The area supports one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world, as well as rich and varied marine mammal populations.<br/><br/>The Arctic region is changing rapidly.  Perennial sea ice has been estimated to be decreasing by about 9% per decade, potentially leading to a summer ice-free Arctic Ocean by the end of the century or even sooner.  In the summer of 2008 the Northwest Passage was open for the first time since satellite imagery has been taken.  Along with the significant ecosystem changes and impact on coastal communities, this change could impact national security and commerce by providing regular trade routes further into regions along the north coast of Alaska.  Opening this fragile area to commerce will heighten the importance of scientific research to understand the effects.<br/><br/>Scientific interest in the Arctic region is intensive and highly varied.  For example, dramatic changes in biological productivity have been predicted as a consequence of progressive warming, continuing ice recession, changing ocean currents, ocean acidification, and varying climatic conditions.  Changing Arctic climate may well be one of the critical drivers for climate change over the entire planet.  Besides biological and climatological changes, the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian areas are also subject to major seismic processes.  Extending our knowledge about subduction zones and the eruptive history of seafloor volcanoes would help predict the potential risk for devastating tsunamis.  All of these scientific missions and activities are of continuing interest and great importance not only to the U.S., but also to the economic and environmental welfare of the entire globe.<br/><br/>The Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV) will provide a safe and highly effective platform for scientific access to these remote and inhospitable areas that are of such great national and international importance.  The ARRV will replace the R/V ALPHA HELIX which was operated by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.  When the vessel was retired from service in 2006 it was well past its expected 30-year service life.  The ARRV will be the first NSF-built ship since the 1980?s.  Committing to construction of this highly capable vessel represents a major NSF contribution to the International Polar Year legacy, advancement of US Arctic Policy, as well as the effort to better understand global issues, including climate change and ocean circulation.   <br/>"

This phenomenon of volunteered geographic information (VGI) is part of a more general trend of user-generated content facilitated by a suite of technologies loosely known as Web 2.0. VGI presents significant new challenges for GIScience research, where existing theory and practices are geared almost exclusively toward more conventional forms of spatial data. Yet to date there exist no rigorous studies investigating the scientific and societal questions raised by this phenomenon. Little is known about why people contribute information, the accuracy or quality of what they produce, appropriate methods for synthesizing or analyzing these data, how the so-called ""digital divide"" may operate to inhibit some people from contributing VGI, or how this phenomenon may impact privacy and confidentiality. <br/><br/>Professors Goodchild (UC Santa Barbara), Elwood (University of Washington) and Sui (Texas A&M) will conduct a 3-year study that will expand basic knowledge about VGI via three overarching objectives. First, the PIs will conduct a comprehensive inventory of existing VGI efforts, and will assess the quality and accuracy of VGI using a sample of these websites. Second, the PIs will evaluate the methodological requirements of VGI with this same subset of VGI sources, evaluating the appropriateness of existing techniques such as spatial data mining and other approaches for analyzing large volumes of spatial data. Third, the PIs will study the social dimensions and impacts of VGI using a qualitative and case-based approach, collecting survey and interview data from applications in emergency management and community development, two important arenas in which VGI is predicted to be beneficial. Finally, to complement these basic and applied research activities, the PIs will establish and facilitate a network of scholars conducting research on VGI, to support compilation and exchange of their research activities, findings, methods, and curricular innovations. <br/><br/>This study makes several important contributions to science and society. It will identify factors that motivate and constrain people from contributing VGI, develop and evaluate techniques for synthesizing and assessing the quality and accuracy of VGI, and investigate the implications of VGI for privacy, confidentiality, and unequal access to digital information and technologies. VGI is thought to have tremendous societal benefits, for example by providing timely information from citizens about the impacts of a natural disaster or early warning of disease outbreaks. This research initiative will make a pivotal contribution toward realizing this potential, by developing basic and applied knowledge about how this new form of geographic information may be acquired, synthesized, and redistributed, and about how its quality may be assessed and assured. Geographic information is a substantial part of the infrastructure of sciences ranging from geophysics to anthropology, so VGI will impact science in novel and important ways. More broadly, VGI entails public participation in the production of geographic information and knowledge at an unprecedented level in human history - potentially six billion or more people could serve as information producers. VGI represents a radical departure from the top-down paradigm that has dominated the production of geographic information for the past few centuries. This project generates theoretical, methodological, and applied knowledge necessary for scientists, educators, policy makers, and citizens to engage this profound transition in productive ways."

Accordingly, a variety of polypeptides comprising the putative repeat sequences of natural structural proteins have been produced with useful applications in nanotechnology and medicine.  This research project is to identify new sequences and strategies for the bacterial expression of functional collagen polypeptides, as well as their recombinant incorporation into elastin-collagen-elastin triblock copolypeptides.  The main objectives of this project are: a) Recombinant expression of new hydrophilic collagen-like polypeptides and characterization of their triple-helix formation; b) Production of stimuli-responsive triblock and multiblock copolymers comprising thermally responsive elastin-like domains and collagen-like domains; and c) Characterization and elaboration of the materials after their assembly.<br/><br/>Basic understanding of the programmed sequential assembly, functionalized with peptide and polypeptide domains, will offer unprecedented opportunities to produce materials with desired assembled structures and subsequent control over the presentation of biologically, electrically, and optically active moieties.  Elaboration of these structures with organic and inorganic groups will offer materials that can function as adhesives, tough wound healing materials, cell-adherent tissue scaffolds, and optically active layers in devices.  The proposed academic programs include teaching and training of students from underrepresented groups including women in the proposed research activities.  ?The Science of Art?, an outreach program as part of this award, will present the science of materials and their properties at art classes to students at secondary level and engage them in scientific concepts in an environment outside of that in which science learning normally occurs.<br/>"

From the perspective of simulations on modern computers, it is <br/>reasonable to hope that generally applicable tools can be constructed which will be useful in answering important questions throughout the basic and applied sciences. The challenge in the computational analysis of waves is that almost all problems of interest exhibit widely varying spatial scales. This is a consequence of the fundamental fact that waves propagate long distances relative to their characteristic dimension, the wavelength. We thus will work to develop methods which allow us to avoid the direct computation of the wave field everywhere along its path, concentrating computational resources only where they are needed. In addition to our work on basic techniques with broad applications, we plan focused studies on problems related to the generation of sound by jets and its propagation into the environment. We believe that the fundamental studies we will carry out can motivate the development of better sound suppression technologies for commercial and military aircraft.  <br/>"

V. vulnificus is a fish pathogen that causes the disease vibriosis and is an opportunistic pathogen of humans. Many Vibrio species thrive in warmer waters and both their local abundance and their geographic range have expanded in the last decade, as ocean temperatures have increased. Some environmental isolates of V. vulnificus cause severe disease with mortality rates over 50%, but how and why these strains develop is an enigma.

The intellectual focus of the comprehensive program is Nature InSpired Engineering (NISE) which is defined as the engineering study or inspirational use of natural systems and principles.  Engineering faculty and students can learn a great deal from nature, infusing that information into research and educational activities, yielding innovative results and inspired students.<br/><br/>To engage participants in the comprehensive program, a team comprising faculty from five engineering departments, complemented by educational technology, ethics, and evaluation experts will be involved.  The joint REU and RET programs will form five sets of research teams.  Each NISE research team will consist of one math teacher, one science teacher, and two undergraduate students.  To further assist in the growth of the undergraduate students, each participant will be paired with a career mentor in addition to his or her research mentor.  <br/><br/>The REU program will be comprised of four main components: 1) in-depth laboratory experiences; 2) corporate site visits and social trips; 3) synergistic workshops and seminars; and 4) a research symposium.  These four components will be common to the REU and RET programs, with overlaps and variations necessary to serve the specific participants. Corporate site visits will expose participants to the practical application of engineering principles they encounter in their research. A broad range of social and cultural activities will be critical to fostering a sense of community within the diverse undergraduate student groups.  A set of workshops and seminars will assist in their development as researchers, improve their technical writing and presentation skills, expose them to technical research projects across the spectrum of NISE fields, and expand their knowledge of graduate programs and the process of applying to graduate school. <br/><br/>In addition, the students will participate in the following activities: 1) a Friday lunch seminar series that will focus on the virtues of lifelong learning; 2) an ethics component; and 3) a summer symposium where they will present a poster illustrating their research experiences.  The activities in the ethics component of the program will include the following: 1) discussions and readings pertaining to ethical issues; 2) talks from experts in the various fields of engineering ethics; 3) each student will give a presentation on a particular ethical issue; and 4) each student will construct a wiki for ethics topics and readings in the field of science and in engineering, which they will be able to update and contribute to in the years following their summer REU participation. <br/><br/>Finally, the summer REU program will be complemented by a set of academic-year activities designed to keep the undergraduate students engaged, tracked, and directly involved in continuing technical and evaluation research and in-school collaboration with the teachers. Two undergraduate students will have an opportunity to work in the classroom with teachers, who focus on translating their research experiences into classroom activities and experiences.<br/><br/>Recruitment efforts will focus on attracting women and minority participants.

The proposed SGER research represents a new approach to locally measure the switching critical curve of coupled nanomagnetic systems. This is a very challenging project because a novel idea for critical curve measurement of coupled magnetic systems will be tested while macroscopic measurement devices will be interfaced with nanosized magnetic objects. <br/> The findings gained from this project will contribute to the basic understanding of the nanoscale physical phenomena, specifically nanomagnetism, providing insights into the dynamic properties of mesoscopic magnetic structures. The immediate benefit for the society comes from the big impact of the proposed activity on magnetic recording technology. Also, the success of this project could have broad impacts on nanotechnology education in the Louisiana by exposing undergraduates students, especially minorities, to the latest research developments.<br/>"

In LCM, a fiber preform consisting of many layers of two dimensional fabrics or one or two layers of 3D fabric is placed in a closed mold and resin is impregnated by vacuum or/and by positive pressure to cover all the empty spaces between the fibers of the preform. Any voids in the composite can be detrimental to its properties. Under this award (i) models and measurement techniques for permeability characterization of 3D preforms  will be developed and  used in a simulation software developed at the University of Delaware to describe resin flow in net shape and complex structures in Liquid Composite Molding (ii) Our modeling and simulation efforts will be validated with flow visualization experiments and (iii) A methodology to inverse the simulation process will be formulated so instead of simulating the flow for known preform properties, a permeability map to ensure robust filling without voids will be developed. This permeability map can then be used to design the 3D perform which is insensitive to processing parameters as well as provide the desired mechanical properties. Deliverables will include a characterization method for permeability of 3D preforms, analysis tools to simulate flow in 3D complex composite structures, inverse simulation methodology for creating permeability maps, documentation of research results, engineering student education, and engineering research experiences for high school teachers.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will allow the process designer to apply the existing flow simulation tools to three dimensional preforms. Secondly, this research will create methodologies for the inversion of the simulation to formulate the permeability property map which can be translated into preform architectures that can be manufactured and used in fabrication of composites structures thus providing a new paradigm that preform design should not only focus on performance but also on ease of manufacturing. Once the properties of 3D preforms are well understood they will be accepted into general use, fulfilling their potential in range of application from transmission housings to infrastructure applications such as bridges and beams. Use of 3D preform will also lead to reduction in hand labor for ply layup in LCM, where instead of placing hundreds if not thousands of individual layers of fabric, only a few pieces of advanced 3-D preform material is sufficient. Further still, as these preforms are near-net shape, the touch labor associated with cutting, darting, draping, and otherwise manipulating fabric placement is almost eliminated, ensuring reliability and repeatability. The results and the technology will be transferred to industries that work with the Center for Composite Materials at the University of Delaware to allow the creation of improved 3D preforms that have tailored properties for the desired application with reduced cost, reduced prototype development time, and improved reliability. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research. High School students and teachers will be engaged to provide them with research experience.<br/>"

Species that are important from conservation, ecological, cultural, and economic perspectives may face decline and extinction in coming decades. Phenology, the timing of biological events, has emerged as a key indicator of species response to global warming and other aspects of climate change.  Phenology includes the flowering and leafing out dates of plants, first arrival dates of birds, and other events throughout the year. The ability of scientists to predict how climate change will affect species and biological communities remains very limited, especially at the scale of countries and continents. Researchers in this project will study the year-round phenological trends since 1953 of numerous plant and animal species using data from 176 meteorological sites across Japan and South Korea. These records cover more species, a longer time period, and more sites than any comparable data set from the United States, and can be used to develop innovative methods of analysis that can be applied to species in the United States and elsewhere. At field sites in Japan, the researchers will examine ecological interactions, e.g., between plants and pollinators, to determine the potential for ecological mismatches among species with different responses to climate change. The U.S. researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students and will work with scientists from Japan, South Korea, China, and Europe, and the new U.S. National Phenological Network, thereby strengthening international connections among climate change researchers."

The main objective is to show that convection together with incompressibility plays an essential role in studying the dynamic stability of the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Another objective of this project is to show that there is a close connection between the global regularity of the three-dimensional Euler equations and that of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, a new regularity analysis using a Lagrangian approach for the three-dimensional Euler equations is developed to control the dynamic growth of the local curvature of vortex filaments and the maximum vorticity simultaneously. The local nonlinear stability analysis developed in this project can be potentially applied to study a large class of nonlinear dynamic problems arising from other disciplines.<br/><br/><br/>The understanding of the dynamic stability and the role of convection has a significant impact on many scientific applications which could affect the quality of people's life in a fundamental way. These applications include weather forecasting, environmental or global climate change, fluid dynamic applications, turbulence modeling and high performance computing. For a long time, many experts considered convection as destabilizing. This project reveals that convection actually has a surprising stabilizing effect which could affect the large time behavior of the three-dimensional incompressible flows in an essential way. An additional impact of this project is the involvement of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. This project provides a solid training in mathematical analysis, physical modeling, and numerical simulation. The interdisciplinary training they receive in this project is very important for their future careers in mathematics and science.<br/>"

Senescence is the progressive deterioration of structure and function over time, and in vertebrates is manifested as an age-related increase in mortality, decrease in fecundity, or both. The physiology of senescence is complex, and involves age-related changes in function of somatic and reproductive cells and tissues, and subsequent changes in interactions among these systems. Analyses of seventeen years of data from our study population of Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) reveals a quadratic relationship between breeder age and number of fledglings produced, with the youngest and oldest birds having the lowest reproductive success. The Florida Scrub-Jay is a cooperatively breeding passerine that is restricted to remnant scrub oak habitat of peninsular Florida. In this project, the investigators will assess reproductive aspects of senescence in this species; taking into consideration reproductive endocrinology, stress physiology, egg hatchability, sperm morphology, life history trade-offs, and age-related variance in parental behavior. Specifically, the investigators will conduct experiments to determine which component of the reproductive (hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal: HPG) axis exhibits senescence by recording physiological changes (primarily endocrine measures) as individuals age. The results from this project which will combine observational and manipulative experiments will ultimately contribute valuable insight into the mechanisms that underlie (or are a result of) avian reproductive senescence. <br/> The broader impacts of the project will primarily be realized through the continuing education of a graduate student. The investigators will present and publish findings in appropriate national and international venues (e. g., at meetings and in respected journals). Similarly, both investigators regularly present research findings to lay organizations, such as ornithological and nature clubs."

The physical environment, the presence of natural enemies, the genetic properties of a population and the abilities of individuals to adapt to the environment all influence population size and persistence. As ecosystems experience rapid climate change, it is imperative to understand how environmental and genetic variation affects the persistence of vulnerable populations. To focus on this critical problem, populations of a native willow beetle experiencing extreme climatic conditions in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California will be investigated. Populations studied for over a decade will be characterized using markers of genetic variation and environmental adaptation. Changes in population size will be related to these markers, to local topography, and to climatic conditions assessed by continuously recording weather loggers. Historical samples from these populations, some of which are now extinct, will be included in this analysis, offering a rare opportunity to analyze changes in populations for which the past environment is characterized. Experiments quantifying reproduction, larval survival, and adult over-wintering survival will assess potential mechanisms contributing to population persistence for beetles of differing genetic and environmental backgrounds. <br/><br/>Findings will provide unique insights into the ability of organisms to cope with and adapt to a rapidly changing environment, and will enhance understanding of the effects of genetic and environmental variation on ecological interactions among species. This project continues a unique, long-term population and climate dataset, and will thus provide a substantive contribution to knowledge of the effects of global climate change on natural systems. Finally, this program will support and mentor a large number of undergraduates, including groups traditionally underrepresented in environmental biology, working in the laboratory and field as a collaborative, interdisciplinary team. <br/>"

Although it has been acquiring tools for decades, for much of its progress it still has to rely on ingenious ad hoc methods. Any move that makes the methods of well-established branches of mathematics relevant to major problems of graph theory must be welcome. By showing how tools of classical analysis and probability theory can be brought to bear on problems of graph theory, the investigators will attempt to bring substantial areas of modern graph theory into the fold of traditional mathematics. Most of these areas are much studied by computer scientists as well, and have applications to networking and the design and analysis of efficient algorithms."

The vast anatomical diversity exhibited by these organisms, coupled with a large body of disparate research and the eccentricities of investigators, yields numerous concurrent and only partially overlapping vocabularies that describe Hymenoptera anatomy. Centuries of Hymenoptera research, therefore, remain clouded by inconsistent terminology (for example, 'annellus' is used for two different head structures and for a part of the male genitalia).<br/><br/>This project will bring Hymenoptera researchers together to build a consensus structured vocabulary (the Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology) that 1) enables discovery of research results from publications, 2) empowers taxonomists to efficiently describe/ diagnose species and 3) provide improved access to information for policy makers, farmers, land managers and the general public.

They also have tremendous conservation value and support most  remaining large native grazing animals in the world, particularly in Africa. A fundamental understanding of the factors most important for sustaining savanna grasslands, including their natural fire and grazing regimes, is required for their management and conservation. Scientists have questioned whether grasslands in different regions function similarly. Convergence in functioning would mean that ecological understanding and conservation strategies could be generalized for savanna grasslands worldwide. But contingent factors specific to a region, such as differences in evolutionary history or the types of grazers present, may lead to unique responses in some savanna grasslands. The goal of this research is to compare responses of key ecological processes to fire and grazing in North American and South African savanna grasslands. Scientists will take advantage of three ongoing, long-term experiments that manipulate fire return interval and the presence of large grazers. Responses of plant productivity, plant diversity and nutrient cycling will be compared, and the mechanisms underlying responses, such as differences in plant traits or evolutionary histories, will be assessed. <br/><br/>Comparative research elucidating the consequences of human alterations of fire and grazing regimes worldwide is needed to enable development of management strategies that can insure the sustainability of ecologically and economically important savanna grasslands. This research will provide the basic knowledge necessary to do so, as well as afford training and important global and cultural experiences for young scientists, graduate students and undergraduates.

This work will be accomplished through the establishment of four international, multidisciplinary and faculty-mentored Study Teams. Each Team will select a research question in economics, biology, or sociology, design a research agenda and perform primary research in social sciences at rural villages. Through village-level surveys, interviews, research<br/>observations, and archival research, faculty mentors will lead students on a journey of discovery that will ascertain how water resource policies have affected the rate of erosion of the Loess Plateau and what can be done to fashion effective solutions.<br/><br/>This proposal is based in part on the most successful elements of the PIs' previous work combined with their current intent to build the conservation and land use database, focus attention on priority areas, expand and deepen international collaboration and continue to engage students in international research with scientific, national and global relevance. Whereas their previous work concentrated primarily on urban themes, this proposal tracks increasing academic and applied interest in rural issues. This is a topic<br/>of current interest because although 80% of the water consumed in Northwest China is used in agriculture which is accomplished by individual families in isolated villages, whether/how conservation measures are implemented in the field is not well-documented.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: This proposal is unique among water resource management studies because it will address rural rather than urban issues -- a notable distinction in that most of the water in Northwest China is used for agriculture rather than municipal or industrial purposes. It is believed that one of the most significant contributions of this work is that it will provide a database for critical water research and planning in one of the world?s most vulnerable ecosystems. The Study Team features a unique combination of multi-disciplinary, international mentors who leverage international, academic and<br/>applied backgrounds to accomplish work that more traditional groups cannot do. The PIs have over 10 years of research experience in Northwest China, including the design and management of two previous programs that provided the experiential background for this proposal and led to numerous scientific and social contributions of more than 50 students since 2001. Further, it  reinforces both academic and national demand for civic engagement as it places science in the center rather than the periphery of the planning arena. It will support four mentors, two graduate assistants, and 12 undergraduates per year from the United States. An equal number of Chinese faculty and students will<br/>participate and be supported by their home institutions.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: This work will play a key role in discovering current conservation practices and the parameters that influence them. A practicable framework for conservation in light of both national and international demand to improve the availability and quality of water to people in a sustainable manner will be provided. Recruitment will be specifically directed to undergraduate institutions that serve underrepresented groups. This work will provide access to current research methodologies in both the social sciences and land/resource management for our Chinese partners while preparing participants for the multi-disciplinary and international-based challenges of social science research in the 21st century by infusing teaching, training and new methods of learning in every aspect of the program.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Office of international Science and Engineering (OISE), from its East Asia and Pacific (EAP) program.<br/>"

These 'B-to-B' auctions are conducted on-line by a number of commercial auction providers.  They typically use auction rules that economists would classify as non-binding reverse auctions.  Bidders compete against each other (hence it is a reverse auction) but the winner is not necessarily the supplier with the lowest bid.  Rather, buyers decide who wins the contract, based on the final quotes and further information on the suppliers.<br/><br/>While these auctions are widely used, they have not been studied by economists.  This award funds the development of a formal game-theoretic model of behavior in these auctions as well as a series of lab experiments that test the theory's predictions about the effects of specific features of the auction design on auction outcomes.<br/><br/>This research advances our understanding of a procurement methods that is in wide use.  The results of this research benefit businesses as well as government entitities that use procurement auctions to find appropriate suppliers.

Recent observations of decadal oxygen changes of in the upper ocean, which now have been documented in every ocean basin, motivate several questions regarding the underlying mechanisms. How does dissolved oxygen respond to atmospheric forcing at different time scales? How do the temporal spectrum and spatial patterns relate to that of its driving forces, both physical and biological, and to the coupling between them? Modeling studies on long-term trends and basin-scale variability revealed that dissolved oxygen is highly sensitive to both physical and biological processes, and it has been suggested as a tracer of climate change in the oceans. However, mechanistic understanding of underlying causes are far from complete, and fuller elucidation of the large-scale modes of oxygen variability is therefore needed, particularly as new data is rapidly increasing. <br/><br/>The research team hypothesizes that the physical and biological drivers of oxygen changes are modulated by the thermocline ventilation in the upper ocean, leading to enhanced large-scale, low frequency variability. The theory leads to novel hypotheses for explaining two recurring and general observations: that O2 changes are so prevalent at decadal time scales and are focused in waters occupying a common position in the water column, namely the base of the ventilated thermocline. They plan to evaluate these predictions using a hierarchy of models ranging from a one-dimensional isopycnal model to a state-of-the-art eddy-permitting global ocean model with ecosystem and biogeochemistry components. The work plan will involve comparison of patterns across a hierarchy of models, illuminating fundamental and non-model dependent dynamics of the oceanic oxygen cycle. This project culminates in the application of our theoretical and modeling approach to the Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) for the proposed global implementation of ARGO-O2 project to develop future observational strategies. This will be a major step toward building a set of tools for understanding the types of O2 variability found in the real world, and laying the groundwork for analyzing a wide range of observational and modeling data for this important tracer. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The researchers anticipate that this work will shed light on hypoxia as an emerging problem in the ocean of strategic importance to fisheries managers and marine conservation efforts. Through the proposed OSSEs, this project will assist in the formulation of optimal observational strategies for the international efforts to develop the global array of O2 sensors on ARGO floats. The results are also expected to provide a mechanistic basis for estimating global scale losses of O2 from such irregular sampling networks, thus reducing a key uncertainty in the quantification of the partitioning of anthropogenic CO2 uptake between the land and the oceans. Finally, the project will provide for the training and support of two beginning graduate students, as well as outreach activities at Coloado Statue University on oceans and climate science for K-12 through graduate students and for the general public. <br/> <br/>"

The project will explore firms' responses both in terms of pricing of home sales versus exports, and in terms of participation and sales in domestic and export markets. The project will make use of a unique proprietary data set that merges the plant census for Ireland (a small open economy) with the survey of prices used to construct the producer price index. The first stage of the project involves merging and cleaning the data. The second stage of the project investigates the extent and nature of pricing-to-market and the significance of price stickiness among a particular group of exporters. Preliminary results are suggestive of slow passthrough of exchange rate changes into import prices. Given evidence of more rapid passthrough at higher levels of aggregation, this suggests that entry and exit of products and exporters may be crucial to understanding real exchange rate movements. The third stage of the project investigates the response of participation and sales in home and export markets to movements in exchange rates.<br/>Intellectual merit: The novelty of this project lies in the unique features of the data set. For the purpose of identifying pricing-to-market and pricing behavior, we know that the products we focus on are actually traded, rather than potentially traded. We measure prices in home and export markets from the producer&#146;s perspective, and we can be certain that we are comparing prices for products produced in the same plant. This gives us a clean identification strategy. Relative to other work on entry, exit and quantity responses of exporters to exchange rate changes, we have access to panel data on sales to some export destinations for the full population of plants rather than just a sample of larger plants.<br/>Broader impacts: The broader objective of the project is to understand the microeconomic interactions that underly the behavior of real exchange rates at the macro level. The results of the project described here will contribute to our understanding of passthrough of exchange rate changes into import prices and the simultaneous dynamics of import behavior, which form an important transmission channel of monetary and exchange rate policy. The project at hand does not focus on the US, but on the case of exporters in a small open economy (Ireland) exporting to a bigger economy (the UK). This case is particularly relevant to understanding why depreciation of the dollar has seemed to have little impact on import prices and overall imports in recent times, because the competitive position of foreign firms selling in the US market is likely to be very comparable to that of the firms in the data"

Using fluorescent protein technologies to study large samples in their entirety at high resolution will provide unprecedented insight into the interactions and interdependencies that occur throughout the sample.  Unfortunately, the field of view of current high-resolution imaging tools is severely restricted, making it difficult to study large samples. Extended volume imaging techniques allow multiple, overlapping regions to be imaged in order to reconstruct a high-resolution, composite, three dimensional volume much larger than a single microscopic field of view. However, the best currently available techniques are not compatible with fluorescent protein signal, because they employ an organic solvent-based embedding procedure that can denature fluorescent proteins that ruins their fluorescence and prevents direct visualization.<br/><br/>To fill this unmet need, an automated, integrated aqueous tissue sectioning microscope stage will be developed and deployed. Compatibility with fluorescent proteins is maintained by eliminating all organic-solvent processing steps. Furthermore, by miniaturizing the device, it will be made compatible with the standard upright laser scanning microscopes that biologists, neuroscientists and other practitioners are currently using.<br/><br/>The features, design and implementation of the aqueous tissue sectioning microscope stage for three dimensional, extended volume imaging will be publicly disseminated in both publications and on web pages of the Caltech Biological Imaging Center. In addition, optimized protocols for mounting, sectioning and imaging samples from a variety of model organisms will be freely distributed to facilitate widespread adoption of the new device. The eventual widespread availability of this modular microscope accessory will allow researchers from all over the world to modify an existing laser scanning microscope to perform three dimensional extended volume imaging of fluorescent protein labeled biological samples.

The PI will pursue two very different objectives in this proposal?crystal engineering of highly stable and porous MOFs for hydrogen storage and nano-engineering of MOFs for potential applications in templated synthesis of core-shell nanostructures and in biomedical imaging and drug delivery.  In the first objective, isoreticular families of robust and highly porous MOFs based on both 4,4-connected PtS and 4,8-connected Scu topologies will be synthesized and evaluated for hydrogen uptake.  By systematically tuning the size of the bridging ligands, ?aromatics-rich? microporous MOFs with different degrees of interpenetration will be obtained.  Rigid guest molecules will be incorporated into MOFs to stabilize the frameworks, to increase microporous surface areas, and to enhance the MOF-hydrogen interactions.  In the second objective, the PI proposes to continue fundamental studies on nanoscale MOFs (NMOFs) and explore their potential applications in a number of areas.  Pioneering work from the PI?s lab has demonstrated the ability to scale-down MOFs to the nano-regime to generate a new class of highly tailorable hybrid nanomaterials with controllable compositions, sizes, size distributions, and morphologies.  Further refinement of the synthetic methodologies will allow the design of novel hierarchically assembled core-shell nanostructures for potential photocatalytic proton reduction and water oxidation and the synthesis of novel biodegradable and biocompatible nanomaterials for magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and drug delivery.  The success of this research will not only have important impact on a renewable and sustainable future energy strategy, but also make positive contributions to improved human health.  <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/> This DMR proposal aims at the rational synthesis of a new class of hybrid materials, namely metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), at both the bulk and nanometer scales.  Systematic engineering of the bulk MOF materials will allow for the synthesis of new hydrogen storage materials which will enable hydrogen-based fuel cell technology for mobile power sources.  Such hydrogen storage materials are of paramount importance not only to the national energy security but also to the reduction of environmental pollution.  Scaling down of MOFs to the nanometer regime allows the synthesis of a new class of highly tailorable hybrid nanomaterials with controllable compositions, sizes, size distributions, and morphologies.  Such nanoscale MOFs (NMOFs) will be used to template the synthesis of novel hierarchically assembled core-shell nanostructures for photocatalytic proton reduction and water oxidation, as well as for the synthesis of novel biodegradable and biocompatible nanomaterials for biological sensing, biomedical imaging, and drug delivery.  The PI will also be actively involved in personnel training at multiple levels, including high school students, undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates.  The proposed research will thus significantly contribute to NSF?s mission on promoting and integrating research and education in addition to its potential impact on our nation?s future energy technologies and health care.<br/>"

The pore water in an unsaturated soil system forms a complex fabric consisting of saturated pockets of water under negative pressure and a network of liquid bridges formed near the particle contact points.  Water influences bulk soil behavior by modifying intergranular stress through negative pressure in the saturated pores, and by providing an intergranular bonding force through the liquid bridges.  The magnitude and relevance of each mechanism, however, is highly dependent on the pore water fabric, which is readily altered with changes in suction, saturation, wetting direction, external stress, and global or localized deformation.  It is evident that changes to unsaturated soil microstructure under mechanical or hydraulic loading will influence macroscopic soil behavior, but the difficulties associated with its characterization have limited development of microstructure-based frameworks for predicting macro soil response.<br/>This collaborative project seeks to observe and quantify the multiphase fabric of unsaturated soils by making use of recent advances in non-destructive imaging techniques.  Microfocus X-ray computed tomography will be integrated with a series of special loading stages designed to image the microstructure of unsaturated sand specimens under controlled suction and stress conditions and over a wide range of saturation and strain.  Images will be analyzed to characterize salient features of the multiphase fabric, including 3D grain orientation, particle contact normals, liquid bridge configurations, and the distribution of liquid- and gas-saturated voids.  Tensors describing these features will be quantified and their evolution tracked as specimens are subject to controlled changes in suction, wetting direction, compression, and shear.  Grain size, density, anisotropy, suction, confining stress, and strain rate will be treated as experimental variables.  Microstructural observations will be integrated into a new constitutive framework for unsaturated soil behavior that explicitly accounts for elements of the solid, liquid, and gas fabric.<br/>The research will work to resolve the links between unsaturated soil microstructure and macroscale response, and will implement them through a new constitutive platform for predicting engineering behavior.  Observations of fabric evolution with hydraulic and mechanical loading will provide direct evidence to address the bottleneck issues that currently limit our predictive understanding of unsaturated soil behavior, including wetting-drying hysteresis, coupling between suction, saturation and deformation, liquid bridge rupture, dilation, and rate effects.  Understanding multiphase interactions in packed particles with wetting fluids is also critical to other scientific fields that deal with physical phenomena such as filtration, drying, pharmaceutical and ceramic agglomeration, and oil recovery.  Teaching and diversity will be enhanced through graduate and undergraduate student involvement and educational module development, including activities targeted specifically for women and minorities at the University of Missouri and Washington State University. <br/>"

More precisely, he will investigate the Fourier-Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series induced from parabolic subgroups. When the degree of the cover is trivial, this reduces to the case of Eisenstein series on linear algebraic groups as studied by Langlands, Shahidi, and others, which have been instrumental in formulating and proving portions of the Langlands program. By studying metaplectic forms in families ranging over all finite covers (including the trivial one), surprising new structure emerges. Brubaker and his collaborators have demonstrated that the resulting Fourier-Whittaker coefficients contain Dirichlet series in several complex variables (so-called ``multiple Dirichlet series'') whose coefficients are described in terms of crystal graphs. These crystal graphs encode information about representations of quantum groups, which are deformations of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. In this situation, the relevant Lie algebra is associated to the Langlands dual group of the group on which one builds the Eisenstein series. The proposal seeks to develop this theory more completely and explore the novel connections it suggests between number theory, quantum groups and combinatorial representation theory. <br/><br/>Langlands' program was initially conceived as a stunning collection of conjectures relating functions with interesting arithmetic properties (e.g., counting the number of integer solutions to an equation) to functions with good analytic properties (e.g., having symmetries and being the solution of a natural differential equation). But similar kinds of duality have been observed in geometry and mathematical physics, leading to geometric and quantum versions of the Langlands programs, respectively.  In short, these dualities have become a lens through which a large portion of modern mathematics and mathematical physics can be organized and understood. However, the explicit underlying mechanisms which relate, for example, arithmetic functions to analytic functions remain largely a mystery. In these projects, Principal Investigator Brubaker with his collaborators and students will use the data provided by the above special examples to attempt to find such a mechanism and attempt to better understand the relationships between various incarnations of the Langlands program in arithmetic, geometry, and physics. An equally important component of the projects is the training of students at all levels by creating a tiered system of mentoring. To bolster these efforts, a set of course materials will be developed to reflect the changing emphasis in modern number theory on analytic techniques, focusing on computational approaches and example-based learning to reinforce concepts"

A common technique to manufacture such materials is depositing a monocrystalline film on a monocrystalline substrate of a different composition (heteroepitaxy); in the process elastic interactions are very important. The project will develop highly efficient computational tools by combining continuum mechanics to handle long-range elastic interactions with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations that can accurately describe transport kinetics at the atomic level.  The methods developed will be broadly applicable, but the immediate focus is on quantum dot nano-structures. Three different approaches will be used to accomplish this task. One of these will use KMC to deduce various parameters used in continuum models.  Another approach will be based on a new formulation of KMC which can be shown, using statistical mechanics, to be connected with the chemical potential. This will allow a fairly seamless connection between our KMC formulation and continuum mechanics. We can exploit this connection to use KMC on small, well separated regions and then combine these regions together using macroscopic variables, such as atomic flux and elastic displacement fields. Another approach is to perform KMC everywhere but using coarse-grained continuum fields that are updated on a macroscopic time scale.<br/><br/>Nanocrystalline materials have shown great promise for many applications such as solid state lasers, memory devices, and photovoltaic cells. It is anticipated that the modeling and computation methods developed in this research will pave the way for performing device level simulations and provide valuable guidance in the interpretation of experimental measurements for strained alloy systems. Our group has close ties with experimental groups based in the semiconductor industry and academia, which will allow us to assess our modeling progress.<br/>"

Over the past decade there has been growing appreciation that the movement of resources across the landscape can act to subsidize populations in local habitats.  In addition, theory suggests that resource subsidies may act to stabilize food webs and ecosystems, but these predictions remain largely untested.  This study will examine the effects of terrestrial-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the stability of aquatic ecosystem metabolism.  Traditionally been viewed as a low quality resource, it is now recognized that terrestrial DOC inputs are a resource subsidy for bacteria that can determine whether recipient aquatic ecosystems function as sources or sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide.  The first goal of this project is to describe the shape, magnitude, and direction of subsidy-stability relationships using a set of whole-pond experiments that manipulate the supply rate of terrestrial DOC.  The second goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms by which terrestrial DOC influences aquatic ecosystem stability.  Specifically, the project will assess whether DOC affects ecosystem stability by modifying nutrient cycling, altering temperature dynamics, or by altering interaction strengths among different groups of microorganisms.  The objectives of this project will be assessed using a combination of autonomous sensor technology to quantify ecosystem metabolism and temperature variability, radioisotope assays to measure nutrient cycling, and molecular techniques to evaluate changes in the metabolic activity of microbial communities. <br/><br/>At a global scale, the export of terrestrial DOC to aquatic ecosystems is increasing due to a combination of factors, including atmospheric deposition, climate variability, and shifting land use.  The tools and approaches developed in this proposal will address this phenomenon and help scientists and managers predict how changes in DOC loading affect ecosystem functioning and water quality under existing and future climate scenarios.  This project has a significant education and outreach component that will foster interactions among the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS), Michigan State University (MSU), and rural Michigan K-12 school districts.  Specifically, the project will continue an ongoing collaboration that will introduce concepts of ecological stability, microbial diversity, and biogeochemical cycling into the high-school classroom.  The project will also provide interdisciplinary research training in the fields of ecosystem science, quantitative ecology, and molecular biology for undergraduate students, a graduate student, a high school teacher, and postdoctoral researcher. <br/><br/><br/>"

The FEMSS is not based on a particular imaging technique in order to acquire the displacements. During this project we will develop an ultrasound array so as to have immediate correlation and validation of the model in house, and we will use MRI images to correlate our data. In order to achieve our goal we propose to (a) Investigate linear and non-linear solid dynamics models for soft tissues, (b) Model and characterize of uncertainties presented in measurements and our system, (c) Develop a phantom virtual laboratory, and to (d) Experimental validation and fine tuning.  We will fine-tune our FEMSS model with experiments performed in our labs.<br/>If successful the proposed work will provide a consistent, unitary mathematical model for the solution of the forward problem for the non-invasive characterization of living tissues.

RSMAS (PI: Tim Dixon), the University of California Santa Cruz (PI: Susan Schwartz), UNAVCO and Costa Rican colleague Dr. Marino Protti at OVSICORI to acquire and deploy GPS and seismic equipment on the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica.   Observation from this network will directly feed into research efforts supported by the Margins Program (OCE-0841091/Miami-RSMAS/Dixon and OCE-0841091/UCSC/Schwartz).   This grant will facilitate an augmentation and upgrade to a current but smaller network of GPS and seismic instrumentation on the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica (funded through EAR- 0502221).  The end result will be extended and better constrained geophysical observations in time and space beyond that now being acquired.<br/><br/>This support will add an additional seven GPS sites and upgrade five of the older existing thirteen GPS sites to PBO standards as well as allow for the purchase and installation of four Guralp CMG3 broadband seismic sensors and associated data loggers to replace equipment in the current Nicoya seismic network that are currently on loan.  Data from the network will continue to flow to the UNAVCO and IRIS publicly accessible data archives.  <br/><br/>The existing Nicoya seismogeodetic network has recorded initial evidence of aseismic slip of the downgoing slab and associated nonvolcanic tremor in May 2007.  This expansion of the Nicoya GPS and seismic network will better constrain the time varying strain field and seismic activity.  Similar albeit higher resolution space-time observations of subduction zone dynamics within the Cascadia and SW Japan subduction zones have radically changed and challenged our understanding of plate tectonic processes at subduction zones with implications for better understanding seismic hazards.  This expansion of the Nicoya Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) will allow for study of a class of subduction zone with different properties from those of the Cascadia and Japan trenches, perhaps most importantly, temperature/age of the downgoing slab.  The Nicoya Peninsula is unique in that it is perched almost directly over the locked part of the plate boundary.  As a result, the proposed geophysical observatory will enable high signal/noise (S/N) ratio observations of plate boundary processes.  Questions to be addressed by the data collected by these instruments include: 1) What is the relationship between slow slip, nonvolcanic tremor, strain accumulation and interplate earthquakes. 2) What is the role of temperature and fluids in tremor and slip generation? 3) Is the occurrence of fast and slow slip tremor spatially and/or temporally separated? The answers to these questions have important implications for understanding the seismic process at subduction zones.<br/><br/>Broader impacts will include international cooperation and technology transfer, graduate student training with state-of-the-art seismic and geodetic instrumentation and techniques, and improved understanding of earthquake hazards in the region.<br/><br/>"

The focus is on understanding how vibrational energy moves over molecular dimensions from one location to another.  This fundamental knowledge is needed to better understand chemical reactivity and to understand heat dissipation in molecular machines.  Two techniques have already been developed in the Dlott laboratory that allow experimenters to input vibrational energy at one location of a molecule and probe its arrival at one or more other locations.  In the IR-Raman technique that will be used to study molecular liquids such as a series of substituted benzenes, the energy is input with a tunable IR pulse and detected by a time series of anti-Stokes Raman spectra.  In the ultrafast flash-thermal conductance technique that will be used to study molecular monolayers adsorbed on metal substrates, heat is input by flash-heating the metal layer and probing the molecular adsorbate with coherent vibrational sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy.  The monolayer method is especially useful for studying molecular machinery, but SFG provides only an overall measure of heat flow, as opposed to anti-Stokes Raman that reveals which vibrational states carry the energy.  Recent advances in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy from the Dlott laboratory will improve the sensitivity of anti-Stokes Raman enough to probe molecular monolayers.  Combined with SFG, these experiments will reveal both the rate of heat flow and the mechanism of heat flow through a series of crafted molecular structures.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/> All machinery generates heat.  When the machine is the size of a molecule, the familiar concepts of heat transport no longer apply.  This project seeks to understand the fundamental science of heat transport through molecules using advanced laser technology that produces light pulses less than one trillionth of a second in duration.  With these advanced lasers, researchers in the Dlott group at the University of Illinois can input heat (vibrational energy) into one part of a molecule and measure how long it takes the heat to reach other parts of the molecule located a few angstroms (1 angstrom = 10-10 meters is about the diameter of one of the molecule's atoms) away.  In this project, Dlott group researchers will develop new techniques to improve the measurement of vibrational energy, and will study how systematic changes of the molecular structure can speed up or slow down the heat transport.  Ultimately this work will lead to a fundamental understanding of heat at the molecular level and provide the underlying knowledge needed to engineer molecules for specific heat transport applications, enabling new technologies to help the US remain economically competitive.  The work will be performed by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at the University of Illinois, who will learn to design, construct and operate advanced laser systems for studies of molecular machinery as they progress in their training to become world-class scientists.  The focus on heat flow processes, which are familiar to laypersons as well as all scientists, helps insure the wide dissemination of the results of our work to technical journals and popular science media.  <br/><br/><br/>"

The planned studies of how proteins shape intracellular membranes will provide insights into an important aspect of organelle and vesicle formation.  The work on photosynthesis involves studies of the chromatophore in purple bacteria, a system involving over 200 proteins and a step along the route of being able to model an organelle.  This will allow researchers to determine the statistically preferred routes for quinones as they couple distant proteins, and how the light-generated electrical potential spreads as it drives ATP synthesis and cellular transport.<br/><br/>The molecular simulation codes used in this work will be made widely available, providing tools for other researchers in the chemistry, biochemistry and materials research communities.

In PDE, the focus is on the dynamical properties of Schrodinger evolution (SE). One subject of on-going research is dispersive estimates for SE. He will also work on mathematical problems on non-linear SE motivated by the numerical studies in fiber optic communication systems. In harmonic analysis, he focuses on problems in Euclidean spaces centered around Lebesgue norm inequalities. In particular, he proposes to continue his investigations on restriction estimates relative to fractal measures, and on their applications in  PDE and geometric measure theory. He also proposes to continue his research on the mapping properties of generalized Radon transforms (GRT) -- a huge class of averaging operators over lower dimensional submanifolds of Euclidean spaces. By applying the techniques  developed for Kakeya problems, he obtained interesting results in some cases. The results on the mapping properties of GRT have important applications in Fourier restriction phenomenon and in general in the summability  theory of multi-dimensional Fourier series.<br/><br/>Harmonic analysis has always found wide applications in natural sciences and engineering.  It underlies a powerful and diverse array of tools currently widely used in applications, and offers the promise of further applications in the future. The proposed research deals with foundational issues which may ultimately help to underpin such future applications. The proposed research on nonlinear SE are directly motivated by the engineering problems in fiber optic communication systems, and the methods used are likely to be useful in a range of applications. The study of the mapping properties of GRT has various applications in engineering. For example, the X-ray transform (which is a particular GRT) applied to the density function of a patients body is essentially the data obtained by magnetic resonance imaging. The study of Fourier restriction, summability theory of multi-dimensional Fourier series, and  dispersive estimates are irreplaceable tools in the study of a wide class of PDE. The proposed research would make  a contribution to the general understanding of these problems. The planned research is also related to certain discrete problems of interest in combinatorics and number theory, which in most cases remain wide open."

The two main projects explore central problems in the subject. The first project seeks uniformly stated combinatorial rules in Schubert calculus, via an expanded theory of Young tableaux. The famous Littlewood-Richardson coefficients arise in this context, but also in the theory of representations of general linear groups and of symmetric groups, eigenvalues of sums of Hermitian matrices and short exact sequences of finite abelian p-groups. The PI will find combinatorial rules for these coefficients and their Schubert calculus extensions, building on joint work with H. Thomas. The second project aims to further develop a combinatorial and computational framework, introduced jointly with A. Woo, to understand the singularities of Schubert varieties.<br/><br/>The main tools applied and further developed in this project come from combinatorics, including algebraic and geometric combinatorics, and combinatorial commutative algebra. Combinatorics concerns discrete objects such as permutations, partial orders and graphs, as well as techniques of enumeration. In many instances, such as with Schubert varieties, continuous objects can be parameterized by discrete data, opening the door for combinatorial analysis. Moreover, one often witnesses that the same combinatorial objects govern a priori different mathematical settings. The Littlewood-Richardson coefficients are a prime example of this.

The expected results will elucidate the interactions of goal-directed neuronal network circuitries to show how animals can make successful behavioral decisions that balance perception of available resources and risk against their own needs.  They will provide a simple model for approaching the neural circuitry for similar value-based decision-making in more complex animals.

Our programs facilitate all stages of development from prospective undergraduate math major to senior mathematician. We propose here to enhance our REGS program and thereby impact several critical transitions at the graduate level.  REGS stands for \Research Experiences for Graduate Students""; for many students REGS provides the initial contact with research. Our current program provides summer support for early graduate students to work (individually or in a group) on a research project with one or several faculty mentors. We propose here an enhanced program with four components: one for incoming Ph.D. students (REGS 0), one for 1st- and 2nd-year Ph.D. students (REGS 1), one for students who have already begun thesis research (REGS 2), and one for students about to complete their dissertations (REGS 3). The first three components are summer programs while the fourth provides a year-long fellowship. We will extend the reach of our programs by including external participants in the REGS 0 and REGS 1 components. The external participants will include students from underrepresented minority groups and also from schools which do not have mathematics Ph.D. programs.<br/>The Mathematics Department at UIUC has a distinguished record of research, scholarship, and training. Our current REGS program has provided graduate students with early research experiences. Our enhancements will stimulate their intellectual development at all stages of the program. In addition we will provide similar opportunities to some students from other programs. All students will work in research areas of current interest and many will make original contributions to them. Furthermore the mini-courses from the REGS 0 program will make the graduate curriculum more dynamic and better in tune with current mathematical research.  Our programs significantly impact the quality and vitality of the national scientific workforce. Because we are a large department with broad mathematical interests, our students go on to a wide variety of careers. Those who become research mathematicians impact many different fields, and those who work in industry or as teachers replicate our commitment to mathematics in their settings as well.  We have disseminated and shared information about our programs via websites and publications; our participation in the Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate (CID) allowed us to share the details of our REGS program. Our ideas are easily adapted to the needs of other departments. Our enhancements include participants from other programs, and hence will encourage an early transition to research for people outside of our department. The REGS 0 component provides a way to recruit members of disadvantaged minority groups to mathematical research.<br/>"

This will change fundamental and applied science and engineering with respect to halorespiration as a metabolic process, and chlorinated solvent bioremediation as a practiced technology. In addition, the work will characterize several poorly understood environmental processes including the overlap of Fe(III) reduction and complete dechlorination, and acetate as a direct electron donor for halorespiration. The proposal has been constructed in a manner that all hypotheses are relevant and independent, and the data generated will benefit the broader scientific community studying basic halorespiration science or those investigating applied bioremediation of TCE.<br/><br/>The proposed outreach plan incorporates both students who are members of underrepresented groups in environmental engineering, and practitioners who will ultimately benefit from the data. The students will be both graduate level and undergraduate level, and will be recruited specially from programs for minority and female students. The practitioner aspect will culminate in direct contact with one group who has already expressed interest in the work and with others via conferences and individual presentations to small groups at their regional offices. Entire research staff including the proposed postdoctoral scholar will interact with all practitioners such that they become accustom to the lab to field transition for research, and how the pragmatic aspects of environmental engineering practice can influence fundamental research science."

This research is directed at strengthening our understanding of the physics of fouling of microfiltration membranes and applying that understanding to mitigate fouling, thereby enabling its use for sustainable manufacturing. The work will proceed along three primary research foci: (1) create and validate a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic model of a tortuous pore network that incorporates hydrodynamic, van der Waals, electrostatic forces, and Brownian motion; (2) use the model to understand the physics of membrane fouling through examination of the motion of single and multiple microemulsions and aggregates; and (3) use the assembled knowledge of fouling mechanisms to create a reformulated semisynthetic metalworking fluid designed with fouling-mitigating fluid properties. The completion of this research will provide a solid knowledge base that can be used to reduce fouling in three ways, namely, changing operational conditions to minimize fouling within a given setup, redesigning membranes to incorporate anti-fouling coatings and pore morphology, and designing fluids to be more compatible with the microfiltration membranes. <br/> <br/>The enhanced understanding of fouling mechanism through this research will help to eliminate the barriers to widespread adoption of microfiltration technology and encourage sustainability within the machining industry through the reduction of millions of gallons of hazardous metalworking fluid waste and the toxins associated with it. In addition, the knowledge gained on fouling mechanisms will not only likely lead to sustainability improvements within the machining industry, but also improvements in the food processing, water purification, and waste-water processing communities. The impact of the modeling approaches developed in this research is not limited to membrane microfiltration applications, as all filtration techniques have to deal with the issue of fouling. One of the important impacts that this work will have is to serve as an ?open door? into the concept of sustainable manufacturing."

Its variability has been linked upstream to tropical Indian Ocean Dipole events which are largely coupled to Pacific winds and ENSO (El Nino- Southern Oscillation). Downstream, it feeds an inter-ocean transport of warm and saline waters into the South Atlantic which directly impacts the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. This makes the Agulhas Current an effective link between the Indian and Atlantic tropical arrays of the Global Ocean Observing System. It is of significance not just to Indian Ocean variability, but to global climate.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The goal of this project is to build a multi-decadal time series of Agulhas Current Transport (ACT). This will be done in a manner similar to what was started in the mid nineties for monitoring Kuroshio transport via satellite altimeter. The first phase of ACT requires deployment of an array of instruments across the Agulhas Current and along an altimeter (TOPEX/Jason) ground track, to obtain a three-year time series of transports via in situ measurements. The second phase involves calibrating the along- track altimeter data with these measured transports to produce a time series of Agulhas Current transport from 1992 and into the future, for as long as altimeter missions continue to along this track. Jason-2 has just been launched (June 2008) ensuring a continuing time series through 2012. This twenty-year time series will provide an important climate index for the Indian Ocean, which can be compared to other climate indices and to the Florida Current and Kuroshio time series. The importance of understanding climatic variability on decadal time scales has come to the forefront over the last decade with the need to distinguish natural modes of variability of the atmosphere/ocean system from anthropogenic changes. In response, the international oceanographic community, particularly through the CLIVAR (Climate Variability and Predictability) program, have developed a collaborative plan for a global ocean observing system, consisting largely of tropical moored arrays, sub-surface floats, repeat XBT (eXpendable BathyThermograph) sections, and satellite data. The CLIVAR Indian Ocean Panel recognizes that western boundary observations of the Agulhas Current are an important and missing element to this observing system. Both the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream transports are continuously monitored, providing a link from tropical to mid-latitude variability in their basins. However, there is no monitoring capability for the Agulhas Current, which has links not only to the tropical Indian Ocean, but also to Pacific variability through the Indonesian throughflow and Tasman leakage, and to the Atlantic via Agulhas Rings.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the project concerns the societal value of monitoring a current that has climate and marine impacts on Africa, a region lacking the capacity to monitor the current themselves. African scientists and students will benefit from active participation in the project, in particular through participation on cruises and via a student exchange between the University of Cape Town and the University of Miami. These collaborations will build local oceanographic experience and knowledge. Finally, the ACT array itself, and subsequent long-term time series of Agulhas transports, will allow a broad assessment of the relationship of the Agulhas to other observed climate indices, making an important contribution to the Global Ocean Observing System by building long-term regional capacity."

The research goal is to characterize the effect of a passively imposed asymmetric force on a bubble during the boiling process. Such asymmetry is created by the use of a surface with repeated ratchet structures and pyramidal reentrant cavities located on one of its sides. The hypothesis is that with several ratchets, this local asymmetric motion can be translated to a net fluid pumping. Educational activities aim to provide a synergy between research and education, as well as between several universities.<br/>The main objectives of the project are to: (1) Determine, using a suite of non-intrusive imaging methods, time-varying bubble diameters and frequencies, liquid and bubble velocities, and temporally- and spatially- resolved surface temperatures, (2) Refine preliminary models based on information obtained from the above imaging experiments,  (3) Validate the model against global measurements of a large-array of ratchets, for which boiling curves will be established, and (4) Integrate research findings into a new module in an existing multi-University Electronics Thermal Management course.<br/>Intellectual Merit: The enhancement technique can be applied to heat transfer from adversely oriented surfaces and in space thermal management. The proposed methods of experimentation present a detailed estimation of flow and temperature field in boiling flows that will be useful to modellers. The proposed analyses will highlight forces of importance by performing experiments under different orientations and subcooling levels, and with two fluids of contrasting properties. Passive methods of heat transfer enhancement are important in a broader context of energy efficiency.<br/>Broader Impact: Educational activities will include integration of the project results in the form of a module into an existing, past-NSF funded Electronics Thermal Management live-internet multi-campus course and will incorporate Oregon State University as a new partner. At the end of year 2, a DC-9 microgravity flight experiment is planned as a part of a concurrent grant from NASA. Several senior undergraduate students will take part in the design and eventual testing of this experiment. An AT&T-Minority-Engineering-Program student at Auburn University will also be working closely with OSU undergraduate students. One promising high-school student, through the Oregon-state-wide Apprenticeship in Science and Engineering Program, will be involved in experiment design and testing."

The current project will extend an ongoing, longitudinal project that has been examining interrelations among parental conflict, sleep, and child adjustment.  Previous waves of data collection in this project demonstrated that disruptions in an important facet of children's biological regulation, namely sleep, can have deleterious effects on typically developing children, and highlighted the importance of simultaneously examining family and sleep functioning in the prediction of child outcomes. The opportunity to follow the same families during a time when children are entering puberty is vital to determine the role of marital conflict in child development. Children and their families will be asked to participate in a third wave of data collection in which marital functioning and associated processes (e.g., emotional insecurity) are examined, children's sleep quality and quantity are assessed, and multiple domains of children's adjustment (socio-emotional, cognitive, academic) are investigated. This wave of data collection will allow the investigators to (1) analyze the mediating (intervening) role of sleep in the link between marital conflict and child development over time; (2) determine whether relations among marital conflict, children's sleep, and daytime functioning persist, weaken, or become stronger as children enter puberty, and ascertain if these associations differ based on child sex, ethnicity or socio-economic status; and (3) clarify processes that can influence child adaptation in the context of marital conflict and sleep disruptions. <br/><br/>Knowledge of contextual factors (e.g., high marital conflict) and psychobiological processes (e.g., sleep) associated with normative familial risk in children are critical for education and prevention efforts, multidisciplinary intervention, and institutional structures and policies relating to children and families. Understanding the role of sleep will inform interventions that promote resiliency, coping, and competence in many areas of functioning. By integrating theories and methods from different disciplines, the study will facilitate collaborations among the medical and social sciences in the ultimate service of public policy and practice. Further, Alabama's high rate of poverty, as well as large minority (African-American) population, makes the setting advantageous for studying the impact of multiple factors on the well-being of a diverse population of children.  There are also a number of educational benefits of this study. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary methods and working with a diverse population. Parents, school administrators, teachers, clinicians, and county agents will have the opportunity to participate in training workshops and seminars that are based on study findings. Finally, results will be presented via professional meetings, multidisciplinary journals, and a user-friendly website."

The transition from the Middle (900-300 B.C.) to the Late Formative period (300 B.C.-A.D. 300) witnessed the development of hierarchical rulership at sites throughout Northern Belize, including San Estevan.  During this time villages developed into cities that were ruled by an elite class who built monumental architecture and espoused an ideology claiming privileges because of supernatural connections.  Mr. Seinfeld's work will clarify how agricultural and dietary practices may have changed with these developments by tracking food consumption patterns during the Middle through Late Formative periods at San Estevan.  This investigation will involve paleobotanical (ancient plant remains) and molecular analyses of materials excavated from domestic middens dating to the Middle and Late Formative periods at the site.<br/><br/>The project will employ an innovative combination of paleobotanical and molecular techniques to study ancient food consumption.  Analysis will integrate data from paleobotanical macroremains with two forms of molecular analysis (bulk stable carbon isotope analysis and compound-specific stable carbon isotope analysis) aimed at detecting maize residues absorbed in ceramics.  These analyses work because maize has a distinct isotopic signature from most other terrestrial plants in the area. Changes in agricultural consumption patterns will be determined by comparing the results of paleobotanical and molecular analyses on materials from Middle and Late Formative period midden contexts.<br/><br/>The project's intellectual merit is to improve understanding of how agricultural and dietary practices relate to wider changes in a culture's ideology and sociopolitical organization.  The innovative combination of methods used to explore ancient food consumption patterns may be used in future studies.<br/><br/>This project will have broader impacts beyond its immediate research goals by contributing to the wider academic community and by training graduate and undergraduate students.  The current project is part of a wider research endeavor at San Estevan involving faculty and students from multiple universities studying political economy and subsistence at the site.  Results will be presented in a dissertation that will be available online along with a database of the analytical results.  Data from this dissertation project will also be disseminated to the wider academic community through publications and conference presentations in the United States and Belize.  The availability of the data will benefit researchers conducting comparative studies of subsistence practices. To complete this project, Mr. Seinfeld will receive training in paleobotanical analysis and advanced molecular analysis techniques.  The project will also provide training opportunities for undergraduate volunteers to assist in sorting paleobotanical macroremains and preparing samples for molecular analysis."

Focusing research efforts on issues of harmful algal blooms (HABs) and microbial pollution of recreational marine waters, the University of Miami strategy has been to build upon existing cooperative efforts and seek out new researchers, blending strengths from those activities in oceanography and biomedical sciences. <br/><br/>In the course of the last five years, we have expanded the original breadth of our Oceans and Human Health Center substantially through leveraged funding and involving new researchers. In particular, in the area of microbial pollution, we have performed human health and exposure studies with predictive mathematical modeling in the microbe component and added methacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureas to the microbe component; and in the area of HABs, we have demonstrated that the neurotoxic amino acid, beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), may be an important toxin in the food web, and we have developed diagnostic and prognostic modeling showing a new source for Florida red tide blooms. <br/><br/>With funding from this Accomplishment-based Renewal, research at the University of Miami OHH Center over the next two years will build and expand on two important ongoing areas of Center research: 1) the modeling of the transport of microbes from the shoreline of a nonpoint source beach within a sub/tropical environment as well as pathogen behavior in this beach and near-shore environment; and 2) further exploration of HAB organisms and their toxins in the marine food chain, focusing on the water soluble neurotoxin, BMAA, associated with blue green algae (cyanobacteria) and the lipophilic neurotoxin, brevetoxin, associated with the Florida red tide organism, Karenia brevis.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:   Research for the next two years of the UM OHH Center will provide: a) a real-time predictive modeling tool for water quality conditions at beach sites as well as important data on pathogens and sand; b) the exploration of the extent of toxin transfer within the marine food chain of two important but different HAB toxins. These research activities will be supported by training and outreach in oceans and human health. Graduate students will be supported in both research projects. There will be an OHH Program to provide undergraduates with the opportunity to work with the Research Projects and their investigators. Opportunities will also be made available for OHH Center investigators and students to travel nationally and internationally to present the results of their OHH research and interact with the other OHH Centers in scientific conferences (including participation in the Second OHH Gordon Research Conference and Graduate Research Seminar in June 2010), as well as interact with visiting OHH Scientists sponsored by the Center. The Center will continue to support the 24/7, 365 day/yr toll-free Aquatic Toxins Hotline (888-232-8635) at the Florida Poison Information Center to provide information on harmful algal bloom exposures and health effects to healthcare providers, patients and the general public, as well as expand the uses and dissemination of the Center Website (www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/ohh/). Finally, the Center researchers are involved in expanding and disseminating an ongoing graduate and upper level undergraduate course in Oceans and Human Health, and the development of a new Textbook on the Socio-Economic Impacts and Human Wellbeing in Oceans and Human Health."

RSMAS (PI: Tim Dixon), the University of California Santa Cruz (PI: Susan Schwartz), UNAVCO and Costa Rican colleague Dr. Marino Protti at OVSICORI to acquire and deploy GPS and seismic equipment on the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica.   Observation from this network will directly feed into research efforts supported by the Margins Program (OCE-0841091/Miami-RSMAS/Dixon and OCE-0841091/UCSC/Schwartz).   This grant will facilitate an augmentation and upgrade to a current but smaller network of GPS and seismic instrumentation on the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica (funded through EAR- 0502221).  The end result will be extended and better constrained geophysical observations in time and space beyond that now being acquired.<br/><br/>This support will add an additional seven GPS sites and upgrade five of the older existing thirteen GPS sites to PBO standards as well as allow for the purchase and installation of four Guralp CMG3 broadband seismic sensors and associated data loggers to replace equipment in the current Nicoya seismic network that are currently on loan.  Data from the network will continue to flow to the UNAVCO and IRIS publicly accessible data archives.  <br/><br/>The existing Nicoya seismogeodetic network has recorded initial evidence of aseismic slip of the downgoing slab and associated nonvolcanic tremor in May 2007.  This expansion of the Nicoya GPS and seismic network will better constrain the time varying strain field and seismic activity.  Similar albeit higher resolution space-time observations of subduction zone dynamics within the Cascadia and SW Japan subduction zones have radically changed and challenged our understanding of plate tectonic processes at subduction zones with implications for better understanding seismic hazards.  This expansion of the Nicoya Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) will allow for study of a class of subduction zone with different properties from those of the Cascadia and Japan trenches, perhaps most importantly, temperature/age of the downgoing slab.  The Nicoya Peninsula is unique in that it is perched almost directly over the locked part of the plate boundary.  As a result, the proposed geophysical observatory will enable high signal/noise (S/N) ratio observations of plate boundary processes.  Questions to be addressed by the data collected by these instruments include: 1) What is the relationship between slow slip, nonvolcanic tremor, strain accumulation and interplate earthquakes. 2) What is the role of temperature and fluids in tremor and slip generation? 3) Is the occurrence of fast and slow slip tremor spatially and/or temporally separated? The answers to these questions have important implications for understanding the seismic process at subduction zones.<br/><br/>Broader impacts will include international cooperation and technology transfer, graduate student training with state-of-the-art seismic and geodetic instrumentation and techniques, and improved understanding of earthquake hazards in the region.<br/><br/>"

In particular, the investigator will study (1) spectral theory for nonautonomous and random linear dispersal evolution equations on bounded domains and its applications to evolution of dispersals in ecology, Turing instability on growing domains, and nonlinear Leslie type models for age-structured/size-structured population dynamics; (2) spatial spread and front propagation dynamics in unbounded inhomogeneous and random media arising from phase transition, nerve propagation, and population genetics. The investigator and her collaborators have extended several classical concepts and notions and established a number of general theories and techniques for the study of the problems in this project and many other nonautonomous and random differential equations. In addition to the established theories and techniques, the investigator will continue to extend relevant classical concepts and notions and to develop general theories and techniques for the study of the problems in this project and other related nonautonomous and random differential equations. The results of this project will enhance the understanding of the dynamics of the systems under investigation, specially, will enhance the understanding of the effects of the time/space dependence and randomness on the dynamics of the underling problems, will provide theoretical and methodological foundations for the further study of these systems and related ones, and will bring closer several separate but related branches of mathematics, including differential equations, topological dynamical systems, and metric dynamical systems, and enrich each of them.<br/><br/><br/>Realistic physical and biological systems are influenced by variations in the external environment, and are often situated in anisotropic or inhomogeneous media. For this reason, the study of such systems via models involving nonautonomous or random or stochastic differential equations has been gaining more and more attention. Due to a lack of general methodology and difficulties in generalizing classical concepts and notions, there is still little understanding of many important dynamical issues in these equations. The investigator will continue to extend relevant classical concepts and notions and to develop new tools and general theories to study the dynamics of these equations. The results of the project will provide deep insight into the effect of the inhomogeneity and randomness of the media on the dynamics of various applied problems including phase transition, nerve propagation, population dynamics, and pattern formation. It will provide graduate students  and junior  faculty members  research training in the area of nonautonomous and random differential equations. It will also create opportunities to interact with students and scientists from other disciplines and will lead to advance in technology."

This consensus on the centrality of affect in children's lives has led to many studies on the emergence, understanding, and regulation of affect states during the first years of life. These studies have suggested that most of the primary affects are present in the repertoires of infants and toddlers by the end of the second year of life, and children begin to acquire labels for these internal states over the third to fifth years of life. Furthermore, many investigators have assumed that affective states tend to be disruptive, especially when they are experienced at higher intensities, and that the primary task of the developing child is to acquire behavioral and cognitive tactics to ""regulate"" these states. This assumption is contradicted by a functional explanation of affects, which claims that these internal states are adaptations designed to signal the infant/child about the state of the immediate context as it has relevance for the child and to prepare the child to act in a manner appropriate to the context. The traditional view on the meaning of affect for young children is also at odds with a recent perspective from positive psychology, which suggests that experiences of positive and negative affects per se are critically related to concurrent experience and are predictors of future adaptive behaviors. Finally, most currently available research considers parents as the critical social elements of the child's social context and few data are available for non-parental adults and peers as social contextual features of very young children. Given that 50% or more of infants under 12 months of age are now being cared for by adults other than their parents for significant amounts of their waking day (with the proportion of children in care increasing between 12 and 60 months of age), it seems prudent to examine both developmental trajectories and the correlates/consequences of affect experiences for children in group care. This study was designed to address a range of questions concerning the emergence, change, and developmental outcomes associated with the experience of both positive and negative affective states. To accomplish this broad goal, an observational study of infants and young children, recruited between 3 and 30 months of age, will be mounted, with participants being observed for 30 minutes in each week (up to 80 consecutive weeks of observation). At selected ages, children will be tested using standard developmental assessments to document individual differences in general psychomotor development, temperament, adult-child interactions relevant to understanding intentionality, attachment security, and peer social competence. Growth models will be used to examine the trajectories of change in affect expression and in several developmental domains. Associations between affect and various developmental outcomes will be assessed using both correlation and structural equation model techniques.<br/><br/>Results of this research will document the developmental pathways of affect experience from 3-6 months through 36-42 months of age (examining multiple cohorts, each recruited at different age levels). This is the first such study involving children in extensive non-parental childcare experience from early in the first year. The study will examine central assumptions from positive psychology, namely that the experience of positive emotions constitutes the very young child's first level of awareness about the support for subjective well-being available in the immediate social context (and conversely, that the experience of negative affects signals contexts that undermine well-being).  The research will estimate the overall level and the nature of changes in affect experience over time. The design allows for testing of critical assumptions from theories of attachment and temperament regarding the social vs. innate influences on tendencies to experience and express different categories of affect. Finally, this study is designed to test the nature of relations between affect experience and peer social competence. Results of this study will be useful for design and implementation of curricula for infants and preschool children and will have implications for caregiver preparation."

As the tourist industry becomes more prevalent throughout indigenous areas in the world, it provides a research setting for understanding how multilingualism mediates social networks, inter-cultural relations, and identity.<br/><br/>The research will be carried out among tourist workers in the town of Coba, Quintana Roo, Mexico. Tourists who visit this ancient Maya site have dramatically altered the economic landscape of this formally agricultural community just over the past few decades. The researcher will focus on the relationship between language use and settings characterized by different forms of exchange. She will examine, for example, the contrast between household (largely centered on interpersonal forms of exchange) and public spheres of interaction with tourists (largely centered on the market economy). Methods of data collection will include extensive observations of conversational content in each setting, semi-structured interviews of local attitudes and cultural beliefs, and surveys measuring linguistic abilities. <br/><br/>The resarch is important because it will look not only at how tourism affects local people, but also if language switching helps or hinders people as they try to reconcile indigenous values with foreign ones.

While Japan has had national programs with the goal of searching for new materials for several years, as a whole the US does not have such broad-ranging discovery programs.  One year after the discovery of the large class of pnictide superconductors, it is opportune to explore the opportunities for further discovery in a small workshop format.  NSF support will enable young US scientists of diverse background and goals to attend the workshop.  The Japanese have also emphasized a significant role for young scientists.  The small workshop will provide an opportunity for the young scientists to present their work and to interact with leading researchers in the field.  Along with the potential of developing future collaborations, the workshop may serve as the essential seed needed to generate long-term materials discovery programs in the US."

Additionally, atomistic models of the experiments are proposed to pursue one-to-one comparison of deformation fields and fracture. The proposed research involves in-situ tensile experiments in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) on one-dimensional fcc crystal nanostructures which are characterized in terms of their atomic structure by high-resolution TEM. Atomic scale modeling of tested specimens will be used to validate existing EAM potentials.  A computational framework will be formulated to identify criteria for yielding and failure of metallic fcc nanostructures under uniaxial loading given their initial atomic structure. Limitations in testing specimens of suitable size and atomic structure will be overcome by employing a previously developed nanoscale-material testing system based on micro-electro-mechanical systems sensing (MEMS) and actuation, using protocols for sample fabrication and manipulation. Dislocation nucleation and/or activation will be identified and modeled atomistically for comparison. In order to address temporal and spatial resolution issues, high-speed TEM imaging will be carried out. Likewise, in order to capture material instabilities and failure, the MEMS technology will be extended to achieve load sensing with feedback control, which will ensure testing under displacement control. Boundary conditions on the atomistic models will be imposed in the form of displacement fields obtained from TEM images taken during the experiments. The atomic rearrangement predicted will then be directly compared with the TEM observations at different strain levels. Deformation of the nanowires will then be modeled including the surface and internal defects experimentally observed. A systematic study will be carried out to develop a criterion capable of predicting nanowire strength and failure, given its size and atomic structure. Although very challenging, if successful this research will constitute a major step in the quest for connecting experiments and simulations at the atomic level. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>One dimensional nanostructures are envisioned as key components in the next generation of electronics and sensors as either nanoelectromechanical systems or interconnects. The protocols developed under this project will allow the identification of mechanical and electrical properties that are essential in the design of these systems and will also impact the development of computational tools used in their design. In the long term, the combined experimental-computational approach developed under this project could be employed in the study of electro-mechanical coupling in semiconducting nanowires, field effect transistors, and other nanosystems. The strain dependence of electrical properties, surface reconstruction and interaction between molecules, all important phenomena essential in the design of nanoscale sensors and devices, could then be investigated following the same ideas. The educational and outreach component of this project will focus on providing opportunities to undergraduate and minority students, through existing programs within the NSF-NSEC at Northwestern University, to participate in 9-week summer internships. Likewise, the PI will add a lab on in-situ SEM nanomanipulation and testing of nanowires in the dual level course Experiments in Micro/Nano Science and Engineering he teaches at Northwestern University. The PI will also develop course materials on atomistic/quantum modeling using EAM type potentials and reactive force fields for his graduate level course Special Topics in Nano Engineering."

Despite intense interest in mapping and characterizing the responsible genes, the processes responsible for maintaining genetic variation are generally unknown. One reason is that direct experimental investigations are impossible in humans and difficult and expensive in most model organisms. More tractable species that can be studied in both natural and laboratory settings are needed to address this question. Wild guppies exhibit one of the most striking examples of polymorphism among animals (male color pattern variation), thought to be maintained by mating and survival advantages to rare or uncommon color types. Mating advantage appears result from female sexual responses to unusual males, and survival advantage appears to result from selective predation on common color types. This project will elucidate behavioral and genetic mechanisms underlying these patterns.  Studies will examine (1) behavioral mechanisms leading to mating advantage for rare types, (2) behavioral responses of a predatory killifish to rare vs. common types and (3) brain gene expression changes that occur when guppies respond to novel sexual and environmental stimuli.  Specific outcomes include determining (1) if female guppies have a specific preference for rare male types, (2) if prior experience with color types affects the predator's behavior and (3) which genes change their levels of expression in response to novel stimuli.  This work will provide a clear picture of how behavioral and genetic processes contribute to genetic variation, and will also provide a model system for understanding response to novelty as a general phenomenon.  Broader impacts of the project will include training of undergraduate and graduate students and further development of the guppy model system as a well-known exemplar for broad understanding of evolution.<br/>"

AAIW fills the southern hemisphere and world tropical oceans at depths of 800 m to 1000 m. These waters are important in the global freshwater budget and may impact long-term climate variability through their influence on North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation. Decadal freshening of Pacific AAIW may be associated with anthropogenic climate change. AAIW affects the stratification of the tropical ocean, and variability in AAIW may thus influence variations in the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. <br/><br/>INTELLECTUAL MERIT. The central goal of this project is to characterize and quantify the formation of Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water in an eddy resolving Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE), to describe their pathways in the SOSE ocean interior at eddy to global lateral scales, to compare the results with the observations, and to identify key processes and locations for SAMW and AAIW formation in support of organizing future fieldwork. The work will also include assessing the fidelity of estimated atmospheric forcing fields, especially at smaller (meso) scales. The investigators will synthesize the results of previous and ongoing projects, focusing on Southern Ocean mode and intermediate water observations and model results. Two years (2005 and 2006) of an eddy permitting (1/6° horizontal resolution) Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) that assimilates observations, including those from two recently cruises in the southeastern Pacific mode water formation region, are available. SOSE permits comparison of the observational (cruise-based) picture of Southern Ocean water mass formation and spreading in the ocean interior with that in a numerical (assimilating) ocean of unprecedented lateral resolution and realism of air-sea forcing. SOSE assimilates surface fluxes, but adjusts them to be dynamically consistent with the oceanic fields, all with horizontal resolution of 1/6°. The investigators have completed a detailed comparison of large scale pattern of SOSE air-sea fluxes with those in the literature, finding them to be a notable improvement over previous flux products, and has also begun a study of water masses in SOSE, which shows that the SOSE fluxes more faithfully capture the density ranges within which SAMW/AAIW is formed than do the standard NWP flux products. A related study of mean flow and eddy dynamics in a different numerical model of Southern Ocean circulation will provides the opportunity to compare water mass properties and distributions in SOSE with those in a stand-alone ocean model of comparable resolution. The co-PI, Professor Talley will provide leadership in synthesizing SAMW and AAIW observations and model results. As a new post-doc at Scripps Institution of Oceanography funded through another project, Dr. Mazloff will continue the SOSE assimilation, extending it in time and data coverage.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: This analysis will document in detail the hydrographic properties of the SOSE numerical representations of Southern Ocean circulation and of their corresponding ocean surface forcing fields in comparison with existing observations and literature. The results will be a foundation upon which to (i) plan and evaluate new observational studies, and to (ii) plan and evaluate new ocean and or ocean-atmosphere model studies, particularly studies intended to evaluate the effects of processes and/or changes in the Southern Ocean on climate. All SOSE fields are publicly available."

This project will investigate the best-preserved early Paleogene avian assemblage from North America to forward rapidly our understanding of Cenozoic avian evolution and taphonomy. The assemblage comprises a rich sample of exceptionally preserved, but largely uncharacterized, fossils deposited in less than ~2000 years in distinct, mapped, and sedimentologically characterized sub-environments of a single lake. The deposits are tightly dated to 50.2+-1.9 Mya and occur in the Fossil Butte Member in Wyoming. <br/><br/>The project is the first to integrate systematic analyses and an investigation of preservational biases that impact fossil evidence from key lake assemblages. The results are essential to gaining: 1) a global perspective on early Paleogene avian biodiversity; 2) an understanding of the timing and paleobiogeographic patterns of the avian radiation; and 3) answers to fundamental questions of how birds and their feathers are preserved in key lacustrine environments. <br/><br/>The results will have wider significance in providing a basis for comparison and indication of likely biases in other assemblages of fossil birds preserved in similar settings such as the Early Cretaceous Jehol Group that yields feathered dinosaurs.

From the LGN, information is relayed to the cortex, where neurons have properties closely related to our perceptual experience.  To understand how the cortex acquires its remarkable abilities, data on its inputs from the LGN are needed.  When we view objects in the world, the neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are stimulated by small regions of space called their receptive fields.  This project will record the electrical responses of the LGN neurons of monkeys performing a visual task.  Linear mathematical models of the receptive fields of LGN neurons will be constructed based on their responses to simple forms.  These models will be used to predict responses of the LGN cells to natural scenes.  In addition, the effects of regions of space surrounding the receptive fields will be assessed.  These surrounding regions are expected to reduce the activity of the LGN neurons so that they are more efficient and they conserve energy.  In addition to improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying human perception, the results may help to generate ideas about improved designs of artificial vision systems that have wide applications in industry.

Semiconductor technology lies at the heart of the revolution in computing, communications, consumer electronics, transportation and health care. In the last decade, diversified demand from consumers has been pushing semiconductor industry to produce many differentiated products. As a result, multi-product-multi-tool (""high-mix"") manufacturing has become increasingly the standard manufacturing model, which poses many challenges that the current APC framework cannot address. The PIs plan research in the fields of run-to-run (RtR) control, control performance assessment (CPA) and statistical process monitoring (SPM) to meet the emerging needs in high-mix production. <br/>Intellectual Merit: The research will create a non-threaded paradigm for high-mix semiconductor manufacturing by breaking from the current tradition of threaded APC, and provide new theories and techniques to address the challenges posed by high-mix production. By sharing information among different threads and different APC components, monitoring and control performance will be greatly improved and the number of required models will be significantly reduced. Specifically merits of each project are summarized below. <br/>Project 1: State estimation and control model update: It will provide theoretical analysis on the non-threaded state estimation problem; in addition, it will develop a systematic approach for non-threaded state estimation and control model update for high-mix production, which handles large-scale nonlinear systems through a linear regression formulation. <br/>Project 2: Control performance assessment and diagnosis (CPA/CPD): Instead of comparing the actual control performance against a theoretical benchmark, the proposed framework explicitly estimates model-plant mismatch and disturbance dynamics to achieve CPA/CPD simultaneously. In addition, it will provide the first non-threaded CPA/CPD tools for RtR controllers in high-mix fabs. <br/>Project 3: Statistical process monitoring: Analyzing the pattern of batch statistics instead of the pattern of process variables for SPM is planned. The approach eliminates data pre-processing required by threaded methods, greatly improves monitoring performance, and significantly reduces the number of required models. <br/>Broader Impact: This research will have an immediate impact on the industrial practice of semiconductor manufacturing, as it specifically addresses emerging industrial needs. Due to the complexity of semiconductor processes and the critical role of APC in fab-wide monitoring and control, the problem addressed in this research has the potential to transform the way industry performs process control. <br/>Because few restrictions were posed during the framework development, the proposed framework is not limited to the semiconductor processes, instead, it can also be applied to the batch-oriented pharmaceutical, specialty chemical, and polymer industries and could inspire new solutions and research directions in general batch process monitoring and control. <br/>This research promotes the education of control engineers for semiconductor manufacturing at both graduate and undergraduate levels. Currently, U.S. semiconductor companies are facing challenges in sustaining a well-qualified semiconductor workforce, including engineers in the area of process control. Therefore, the three universities are committed to the continuing education and training of students and professionals in semiconductor manufacturing process control. Moreover, these projects are potential resources for involving minorities and giving them research experience in semiconductor process control. Finally, the PIs will offer short courses on the new process control paradigm to mid-career professionals in the semiconductor industries."

Warfare changes society, and is a spatial phenomenon that generally occurs at regional scales. The spatial patterning of fortifications informs archaeologists on where people are threatened by war or where warfare occurred, but has until recently been difficult to assess regionally. This research addresses the need for systematic data collection on defensive sites in a large region to better permit assembly of scholarly contributions, and more rigorous comparison. The Fellow?s examination of fortifications on the coast of Perú will address two time periods during which war is rampant: the Early Horizon (ca. 900-200 B.C.) during which a pan-Andean cult ideology is widely adopted, and the Late Intermediate Period (ca. A.D. 1000-1476) during which the Chimú Empire expands southward. During the fellowship tenure the Fellow will establish a database of information on fortifications, and develop new methods and theories in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to apply to a regional archaeological analysis of warfare.<br/><br/>The Fellow will spend one year in Perú carrying out fieldwork to systematically identify and map all hilltop forts from 11 coastal valleys. She will spend 2 months doing a remote survey of forts by analyzing aerial photographs at the Servicio Aerofotográfico Nacional in Lima. This remote survey will prepare her for 10 months of fieldwork during which she will visit each fort to collect data. The Fellow will also date a sample of the fortifications using radiocarbon dating. Using these data she will address the following questions: 1. How many forts are there, where are they, and how big are they? 2. what are the dates of each, how are they constructed, and is there any indication of attack? 3. Where are the water sources (river, lagoon, and ocean)? 4. What are the best routes and travel times between forts, valleys, and the coast and highlands? and 5. What are the changes in patterns of fortification over time?<br/>Regional analysis using GIS and spatial statistics will be carried out to rigorously test models of the relationship between human settlement, landscape use, and warfare as a social phenomenon. The Fellow will integrate theoretical knowledge from anthropology, archaeology, and GIS, and technical mastery of computer applications so that GIS tools can be programmed to assess models of human interaction, fort use, and war. The Fellow will by mentored by Dr. David Webster and Dr. George Milner of the Department of Anthropology at Pennsylvania State University (PSU). PSU is a leader in both GIS research and the anthropology of warfare. The Fellow will have access to computing infrastructure and advanced analytical training that will permit new methods to be developed to examine the regional problem outlined. Advanced GIS training will include the construction of geodatabases, knowledge of map algebra, and learning Python and other script languages to develop and automate new analytical processes, and carry out very complex spatial analyses of visibility, movement, and surfaces over a very large region. Based in the Department of Anthropology, the Fellow will be guided in the application and forging of new methodological and theoretical ground in GIS and archaeology.<br/>Intellectual Merit: The broad impact of this research will be improved knowledge of indigenous warfare and its variability, and a better understanding of prehispanic Central Andean society and social dynamics. The results will provide new insights into the spatial and social dimensions of warfare. The research will contribute toward cross-cultural investigations of war and society, a topic of heightened anthropological interest in today's world. The research is significant for methodological and theoretical improvement of the use of GIS in archaeology. The Fellow will acquire advanced technical command of GIS. She will gain a high level of expertise to employ advanced and newly developed GIS techniques tailored to archaeological questions, transforming understandings of warfare and methods of regional analysis.<br/>Broader Impacts: The fellowship will aid in the Fellow?s long-term research goal of explaining the causes of warfare and understanding its varied social dimensions. The database created will be shared with other investigators to provide a basis for more intensive future investigations by the Fellow and colleagues. Radiocarbon dates will enhance current chronologies for the Central Andes, improving temporal control in the region. Spatial control of the distributions of fortifications and calculated routes will sharpen the ability of archaeologists to further examine individual sites within a broader context. The Fellow?s training will bridge anthropological archaeology and GIS, and provide her the knowledge and skills to enable her to teach this cross-disciplinary approach to the next generations of anthropologists and archaeologists."

We plan to synthesize these new materials by combining the state-of-the-art in traditional polymer synthesis methodologies with recent breakthroughs in soft lithography that we have pioneered called Particle Replication in Non-wetting Templates (PRINT®).  What we hope to try to achieve is the synthesis of mesoscopic variants of conventional polymers that we will call ?meso-polymers?.  By ?meso-polymers? we mean molded polymeric objects that are filamentous in nature that have length to diameter ratios that rival that of synthetic polymers.  This has never been achieved before.  It will be very interesting to see if we can synthesize meso-polymers having various and tunable solubility parameters (varying degrees of hydrophilic, hydrophobic, fluorous phases); various degrees of stiffness (analogy to rod-coil polymers); controllable lengths (% compositions); and connectivity (ABA, ABC, ABABA, etc).  If we can achieve such high aspect ratios, meso-polymers should provide great insight into how polymers entangle and form higher order structures. The proposed research effort has three aims involving the attempted i) synthesis of meso-polymers; ii) the characterization of the physical properties of single-phase meso-polymers; and iii)  the synthesis and mesoscopic characterization of multi-phase meso-polymers.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  Polymers are long chain molecules with very high length to diameter ratios that impact our everyday lives as plastics, coatings, adhesives, and rubbers.  They are found in everything from acrylic paints and rubber tires to plastic bottles, bulletproof glass, and computer keyboards.  The fabrication of polymers results in materials that have a distribution of lengths and, due to the fibrous nature of polymers, are entangled with one another.  Making polymers out of more than one material is very complicated and introduces composition as another variable.  To further the science and understanding of this important class of unique materials, we propose to fabricate precisely controlled polymer mimics that we term ?meso-polymers.?  The meso-polymers will be fabricated using a molding technique called PRINT® that is akin to baking muffins in a muffin pan but on a much much smaller scale. Using PRINT, meso-polymers will be fabricated out of a variety of materials with very high aspect ratios approaching 10 million!  The successful synthesis of these materials will have a significant impact on the polymer science community.  It is expected that meso-polymers will have fundamentally different characteristics from conventional polymer molecules and it is anticipated that the success of this program will change the way people think about polymer molecules and indeed new physics will have to be invoked to understand the properties and characteristics of these materials. <br/>In addition to advancing the understanding of polymeric materials, this project will also promote teaching, training and entrepreneurship. Graduate students will learn how to solve problems by starting with polymer synthesis moving to material properties and applications. Anticipating that we will have a breakthrough with this program, several initial patent applications will inevitably be developed which will be done by the student co-workers on this project.  Such patents will protect our ability to do translational science and engage the outside community to address heretofore unmet needs in numerous fields.  The filing of these patents and the multi-disciplinary interactions will also provide great educational experiences for the students involved.  Additionally, it is expected that the research results will be incorporated, where appropriate, into the teaching of undergraduate organic chemistry and of graduate polymer chemistry to help students appreciate the utility of basic concepts and the translational opportunities of innovation.<br/>"

Their success has in part been attributed to the use of, and dependence on, technology of which stone tools represent the earliest evidence. The form of stone tools, together with data on their use and manufacture (knapping), also provide a long record of human cognitive development. Since the early period of tool production corresponds to major changes in the morphology of the hand, wrist and arm, researchers have suggested that increasing use of stone tools played a role in shaping modern human upper limb anatomy.  The fracture mechanics involved in producing stone tools in different raw materials and the biomechanics of the upper limb during stone tool production, however, are not well understood. The interactive relationship of fracture mechanics and upper limb morphology on the resulting stone tool is also unclear. This project addresses these issues from an interdisciplinary perspective that integrates lithic analysis with experiments in fracture mechanics and biomechanics. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1.) magnitude and direction of knapping forces required to produce specific flake morphologies can be predicted from raw material properties (i.e., toughness) and core shape, and, 2.) evolved upper limb morphology in Homo plays a key role in efficient stone tool production.<br/>         The research design involves fracture mechanics experiments on relevant raw materials, followed by a two phase analysis of knapping motions using a digital motion analysis system to study upper limb motion patterns and forces acting across the hand and wrist. The motion analysis study will involve ten experienced knappers replicating stone flakes and tools in two different raw materials from four different successive tool traditions (Oldowan, Acheulian, Levallois and Middle Stone Age). The two phases will involve the same tasks but in the second phase the knappers' wrists will be restrained to ~30° of anterior-posterior motion to simulate the primitive condition found in African apes and early hominins. Flakes and tools from the two phases will be compared and analyzed for the accuracy and efficiency of motions during the natural vs. the restrained condition. The goal of this study is to determine how fundamental variables involved in stone tool production (material toughness, fracture behavior, core shape and upper limb kinematics) interact to determine flake morphology, knapping accuracy, and energetic efficiency. The study will provide new insights into the advent and development of stone tool production and the evolution of the human upper limb.  This in turn has significant clinical implications for understanding upper limb joint motions, variations in morphology, and the impact of injuries and degenerative bone diseases."

However, the impacts of the MJO on the chemical component of the climate system are not understood nor even well documented. This project studies the MJO's impacts on atmospheric ozone and aerosols, two important atmospheric constituents. First, the investigators will utilize a rich set of atmospheric ozone and aerosol data from a number of satellite sensors and in-situ observations to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of intraseasonal variability of atmospheric ozone and aerosols as well as the dynamical and hydrological (e.g., rainfall, winds, and water vapor) patterns associated with these variations. Second, they will compare the intraseasonal variations of atmospheric ozone and aerosols between satellite/in-situ observations and chemistry/transport model (CTM) (e.g., Community Atmosphere Model with chemistry) simulations in order to quantify the fidelity of the CTM's representation of intraseasonal variability of atmospheric ozone and aerosols. Where possible, they will use the model and observations together to more fully understand the dynamical and chemical processes behind the intraseasonal variations of atmospheric ozone and aerosols. <br/><br/>This project will lead to better documentation and understanding of the intraseasonal variations of atmospheric ozone and aerosols and their connection to the MJO in both observations and models.

Recent studies suggest that plant-pollinator communities have a universal type of structural organization that is determined by the degree of mutual dependency and specialization of interactions among their members. However, since community composition is contingent upon overall species diversity, among other factors that vary across latitudes, plant-pollinator communities likely yield different structures in distinct geographic regions. This study focuses on a tropical plant-pollinator community in the Brazilian Cerrado, one of the most diverse and endangered tropical ecosystems in the world. High plant diversity and frequent occurrence of specialized pollination systems create an important opportunity for a community-wide analysis of structural organization using a particular approach that treats this community as a network. This structure will then be compared to the universal structure proposed for other plant-pollinator communities, providing an important contrast with previously well studied systems outside the tropics. In addition, field sampling will be conducted both in the wet and dry season, to determine how environmental conditions may affect community structure. The project involves collaboration between South American and North American institutions, training of undergraduate and graduate students in Brazil and the U.S., as well as the identification of keystone species that may have an especially important role in the conservation of plant-pollinator communities in the Cerrado."

The complex nature of the coupled electromagnetic and thermo-mechanical phenomena that occur during these rapid processes, have not been the object of a systematic study from the mechanics standpoint. The goal of the proposed work is a systematic investigation of electromagnetic loading phenomena, which is expected to help: a) characterize, using fundamental experiments, the constitutive response of structural metals under EMF conditions and: b) establish the modeling capability required for such processes, and validate with experiments in which full field strain measurements will be performed in real time.<br/><br/>The proposed study will enable a useful new technology, since the EMF process has the advantage of being a rapid, low-waste and environmentally friendly process for manufacturing parts out of alloys that are difficult to shape through conventional means. Recent advances in electronics and energy storage technology make EMF technology ripe for mass production, and plans are well under way for the large scale manufacturing of fuel cell plates and tubular frames for the automotive industry. The fundamental understanding of this process will significantly push the use of EMF towards large-scale applications through links that have been established with interested industry to facilitate such transition.

The first way is that the rates of many biological processes determine their function. The second way is that the mechanisms of biological reactions can be revealed by a study of their reaction rates. The goal of this instrument development program is to make tools that efficiently probe the time dependent evolution of biopolymer structures. What is unique about the tools to be built is that they allow reactions to be followed from their earliest steps from the point of view of each monomer of the polymers DNA, RNA and proteins. These tools will be low-cost, easy-to-use and inexpensive-to-operate machines so that biology laboratories will have an entrée into quantitative analysis and biophysical laboratories the incisive tools required for the analysis of very fast biological reactions. The mixing devices that will be built will be able to acquire time ? progress curves commencing from the earliest steps of macromolecular folding and binding reactions with as spatial resolution as fine as every residue of the polymer chain. From a quantitative understanding of the molecular mechanism of individual systems flows a broader understanding of the interrelationships among multiple systems. Ultimately, predictions of the behavior of biological systems based upon the physical properties of their constituent processes will be possible. While such predictions are an admittedly ambitious goal, new technological tools such as those to be built in this study will enable the acquisition of both the depth and breath of information that can make this dream a reality. The project will undergraduates in research through a Summer Undergraduate Research Program. Outreach activities include performing demonstrations is middle and high schools, as well as make them available to middle school and high school teachers."

The quality of this learning experience is in large part determined by the availability of the skeletal teaching materials. Because these holdings vary considerably from one institution to the next, the educational experience depends significantly on available materials. In recognition of the limited availability of these artifact materials, a digital library devoted to the human and primate skeleton was constructed a few years ago: www.eSkeletons.org. This website was an early component of NSF's National Science Digital Library and, along with its 2D and 3D multimedia materials and interactivity, helped to expand the definition of what constitutes a digital library. <br/>The eSkeletons resource provides a ""one stop shop"" for detailed reference information about the human and primate skeleton.  It includes the digitized skeletons of rare and endangered primate species in order to expand the student's understanding of some rarely studied close relatives of humans. The eSkeletons' user community is represented by a diverse body of learners who vary by age and grade level, and who differ in their expected learning outcomes in visiting the site.  Experience with these users led to the realization that many users, students, and teachers would benefit from the inclusion of a curriculum that would provide them with a more focused and individualized (but still directed self-study) that taught and tested them about their understanding of the skeleton. Thus, this project is building on the eSkeletons materials to create an online course in Human Skeletal Biology. The initial work is focusing on an upper division undergraduate course that is being implemented and tested at the University of Texas at Austin. <br/>The online course incorporates multimedia self-paced learning modules and exams that teach and test the student's mastery of the subject matter.  An advantage of this asynchronous learning environment is that students can study and review materials without regard to lab open hours or bone availability because virtual materials are always just a mouse click away. Students can take their exams when they have mastered the topic, rather than following a preset schedule. Because the website is designed around a database, its hierarchical structure can be used to evaluate how a particular student navigates through the learning materials, and it is anticipated that this sort of tracking will reveal other learning patterns that are both student-specific and more generally applicable to other learners."

In many species, males vary markedly in anatomical, physiological, and behavioral traits that constitute discrete alternative strategies for obtaining mates.  A proposed mechanism for the maintenance of such variation is frequency dependence, which states that if a given male strategy becomes rare its success in reproductive competition will increase relative to the other strategies therefore preventing its extinction. In the fish Xiphophorus nigrensis, there are two strategies that are correlated with male body size, small 'sneaker' males that pre-empt female choice by forcing copulations and larger 'courting' males that produce behavioral displays females find attractive. To test the frequency dependence hypothesis, sneaking and courting male X. nigrensis will be distributed at different frequencies in semi-natural enclosures and their reproductive success measured using genetic markers. The success of the strategies in nature will also be measured by comparing strategy frequency in the adult population to strategy frequency in a sample of offspring collected from pregnant females. In addition, this study will examine the effects of frequency dependence on the genetic diversity within individual broods produced by females. Sneaker male X. nigrensis produce ejaculates that contain both a higher proportion of living sperm and sperm that is longer lived, and as a result it is expected that variation in the quality of sperm between strategies will influence the rates of multiple paternity. This research will broaden our understanding of how frequency dependence affects patterns of genetic variation both at the population level and among offspring within broods.  The broader impacts of this project involve training of a graduate student, mentorship of undergraduates and outreach to elementary school children."

The initiative builds on previous work in other parts of the world (e.g. Europe, Australasia) and on recent efforts in the U.S. to create science festivals.  The target audiences are families, children and youth ages 5-18, adults, professional scientists and educators in K-12 and informal science institutions, and underserved and underrepresented communities. Project partners include the MIT Museum in Cambridge, UC San Diego, UC San Francisco, and the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. The deliverables include annual science festivals in these four cities supported by year-round related activities for K-12 and informal audiences, a partnership network, a web portal, and two national conferences. Ten science festivals will be convened in total over the 3 years of the project, each reaching 15,000 to 60,000 participants per year.  STEM content includes earth and space science, oceanography, biological/biomedical science, bioinformatics, and computer, behavioral, aeronautical, nanotechnology, environmental, and nuclear science. An independent evaluator will systematically assess audience participation and perceptions, level/types of science interest stimulated in target groups, growth of partnering support at individual sites, and increasing interactions between ISE and formal K-12 education.  A variety of qualitative and quantitative assessments will be designed and utilized.   The project has the potential to transform public communication and understanding of science and increase the numbers of youth interested in pursuing science."

Only a few reproductive genes have been studied, and most of the work has been in a few model organisms. Members of the Australian bird family Maluridae (Australian wrens), have an extremely high level of sperm production, suggesting an unusual genetic influence on reproduction. The first goal of this study is to identify novel reproductive genes that are expressed in the testes. Then the mechanisms of evolution of these genes will be examined and their diversification within the Maluridae will be compared with control genes that have not been exposed to natural selection. A final study, of geographic variation for one species, will give a better understanding of the underlying source of selection on reproductive genes. <br/><br/>This project includes collaboration with a several Australian organizations, which will foster the exchange of academic knowledge and scientific technology between Australia and the United States, and it will serve as an example of applying the most recent genetic methods to non-model organisms.

By using a pressure-quenching technique, they will synthesize glasses that have a high thermo-mechanical resistance when subjected to large temperature and pressure fluctuations, which will find a wide range of uses in pressure sensors, optoelectronics and space applications.  An integral part of the project is to introduce materials simulation and modeling into the materials science and engineering curriculum through course development and redesigning.  In carrying out this project, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the fields of glass science and computer simulation.  Special efforts will be made to attract underrepresented minority students into materials research, and into science and engineering in general, through various programs at Rensselaer. Findings of this project will be disseminated to a wider audience through national and international seminars and conference presentations.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: <br/>Characterization of the structure of amorphous materials has always been a challenge.  Studies of the pressure and temperature dependence of elastic moduli for amorphous materials give considerable information about the structure of glass, since elastic properties are directly related to the interatomic forces and potentials, which in turn determine the vibrational properties of glass.  In this project, one of their major efforts will be to use light scattering techniques as structural characterization tools for glass, by studying the pressure and temperature dependent vibrational and elastic properties of glass using Raman and Brillouin light scattering.  To complement the experiments, they will carry out large-scale atomistic simulations to study glasses under external thermal, mechanical and radiation impacts.  Once reasonable models are obtained for the glasses under investigation, they will use these models to explain experimental observations, predict the properties of glasses not yet synthesized, and provide guidelines for designing new glasses with desired properties. In this project, they will develop a pressure-quenching technique that can be generalized to synthesize glasses with novel properties. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an atomistic understanding of the response of glasses to external thermal, mechanical and radiation impacts, and an ability to tune these properties by changing the structure of glass through processing in a controllable way. <br/><br/>"

The addition of functionalized carbon nanotubes is found to initiate crazing in thermosetting epoxies which are a class of polymers that do not exhibit crazing. The objective of this project is to understand the mechanism by which crazing is initiated in thermosetting epoxy polymers by the addition of functionalized carbon nanotubes. To this end, the effect of structural changes induced by these nanotubes on the cure chemistry of the epoxy will be studied. The relationship between these structural changes and the mechanism of crazing will be established. Furthermore, the effect of multiscale static and dynamic stress heterogeneities on the mechanical response of the material will be studied.  An ability to control crazing in thermosetting epoxies could significantly enhance their toughness and ductility without reducing their mechanical strength. Given the widespread use of epoxies in structural applications this is expected to translate into significant practical applications.  <br/>  <br/>The results of this work will provide a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which functionalized carbon nanotube additives can initiate crazing in thermosetting epoxies. This can lead to the development of a new class of nanocomposite thermosetting polymers with significantly enhanced toughness, ductility and fatigue resistance, while at the same time enhancing the strength and stiffness of the polymer. A variety of applications involving thermosetting epoxies such as paints, coatings, adhesives, industrial tooling, composites as well as the semi-conductor and electronics packaging industries will benefit from this research.  In order to integrate research and teaching, specially designed interactive modules will be introduced into the curriculum as well as in the science courses taught at a science museum.  The outreach activities will also include experimental demonstrations and presentations to high school students and teachers. <br/>"

Representation theory is one of the cornerstones of the Langlands program in number theory, dating to the 1970s. Zuckerman's work on derived functors, the translation principle, and coherent continuation lie at the heart of the modern theory of representations of Lie groups. One of the major unsolved problems in representation theory is that of the unitary dual. The fact that there is, in principle, a finite algorithm for computing the unitary dual relies heavily on Zuckerman's work.<br/><br/>In recent years there has been a fruitful interplay between mathematics and physics, in geometric representation theory, string theory, and other areas. New developments on chiral algebras, representation theory of affine Kac-Moody algebras, and the geometric Langlands correspondence will be some of the focal points of the conference. Recent developments in the geometric Langlands program point to exciting connections between certain automorphic representations and SYZ type fibrations in geometric mirror symmetry.

All of the represented fields are advancing rapidly<br/>and in all cases the mathematical advances, the engineering<br/>advances and the new experiments enabled by new technology or<br/>innovative ideas combine together to make a rich opportunity for<br/>new research projects at the interface of disciplines.  It is<br/>expected that research projects will be inspired, and in some<br/>cases be newly developed, as a result of the workshops.  The<br/>presentations include state of the art techniques in mathematical<br/>sciences and engineering; an important addition in some of the<br/>workshops is the inclusion of experimentalists who describe their<br/>latest advances, the data sets that are obtained from those<br/>experiments, and their anticipated results from that data.  Early<br/>career participants, including a strong representation of<br/>participants from underrepresented groups, are targeted.  The<br/>Inverse Problems Center, IPRPI, provides an ideal environment to<br/>hold these workshops. <br/><br/>     The problem areas being targeted all impact quality of life<br/>and safety of individuals.  Two of the workshops specifically<br/>target medical imaging; one is in imaging of biomechanical tissue<br/>properties, a new, very fast moving area with significant success<br/>anticipated, and another considers diffusion optical tomography,<br/>which also has a great deal of promise.  Successes in these two<br/>areas significantly impact human health.

For example, in a financial market each investor may have different pieces of information about the underlying value of an asset or a company.  In product markets, each competiting firm may have private information about its cost structure.  In auctions, such as the wireless spectrum auctions organized by the Federal Communications Commission or the offshore oil tracts auctioned off by the U.S. Department of the Interior, the bidders have private information about their valuations and also some, possibly noisy, information about the valuations of their competitors.<br/><br/>The private information of an agent, whether it is about his/her own valuations or the valuations of the competing agents will determine the behavior and the strategy of the agent.  But in practice, the theoretical and/or empirical analysts do not have a clear understanding of what the economic agents know and, in particular, what they do or do not know about each other.  The missing and incomplete information si also highly relevant from a policy perspective as the supervising or regulatory authority in many markets face similar informational constraints.<br/><br/>The PIs develop methods that allow predictions about the behavior of economic agents and the reulting market allocations in such settings.  These predictions are robust to a large class of private information structures by the agents.  They identify conditions on the nature of the interaction and the market under which it is possible to make unique predictions about economic behavior.  When these conditions are not met, the PIs establish robust bounds on the distribution of possible economic outcomes, especially the mean and the variance of the outcomes.  They use these bounds to predict the welfare impact of information sharing in markets.  They also use the bounds to design robust mechanisms, such as auction and voting methods, that perform well in many information environments.<br/><br/>This project provides an economic theory that can lead to practical solutions to market and mechanism design problems.  It also provides a theoretical foundation for future work in econometrics aimed at testing models in situations where the researcher does not know the market's information structure.<br/><br/>This research will have broader impacts for the many different areas of social science that use game theory as a fundamental tool.  In addition, the project has direct implications for antitrust policy, since whether or not to allow sellers to share information is a question for price-fixing policy."

Competitive markets are characterized by large numbers of sellers featuring identical products and large numbers of buyers, all with good information about trading possibilities.  As a result, participants in this market have no effect on the market price, and do not care who they trade with?buyers are just as happy to trade with one seller as another, and sellers as happy to trade with one buyer as another.  Prices have relatively little to do in such markets, serving to balance the quantities supplied and demanded, with the remaining details of how trade occurs and who trades with whom being largely irrelevant.  It is thus no surprise that competitive markets work relatively well.<br/><br/> Much of current economic theory is concerned with the many markets in our economy that are not competitive.  It is well understood that markets will not be competitive when there are only a few buyers or sellers, large enough to affect prices through the exertion of market power, and a rich literature in industrial organization has emerged to examine such markets.  The research described in this proposal is instead concerned with cases in which markets create asymmetries that distinguish agents, giving rise to personalized relationships (rather than the anonymous interactions of competitive markets).  How are resources allocated in such personalized markets?<br/><br/>The research begins by examining markets in which people must undertake investments before they can trade?potential employees may acquire skills, just as employers may invest in capital equipment.  These investments introduce a matching component in the subsequent market, as people vie to trade with desirable partners.  The appropriate legal and institutional structure, including especially the appropriate assignment of property rights, turns out to be critical for prices to do an effective job of clearing such markets.  This project gives us a new understanding of this relationship, potentially leading to the possibility of designing more effective matching markets.  A second component of the research examines relationships in which people repeatedly deal with one another, sometimes sacrificing short-term gain in the interests of a more effective long-term interaction.  Technically, the research advances the theoretical tools used to examine such relationships, namely the theory of repeated games under incomplete information.  More concretely, the investigator applies these tools to model specific economic questions involving resource allocation and price formation.   Finally, the research considers cases in which economic interactions are personalized rather than anonymous because the preferences of the parties are linked, with each having some regard for the welfare of the other.  <br/><br/>The intellectual goal is a better understanding of resource allocation and economic behavior. A running theme is that personalized interactions often complement or even replace prices and markets in allocating resources. Taking a longer term view, this research enhances our understanding of how to better allocate resources through the design of more effective markets.<br/>"

Using microalgae-derived lipids as biofuel feed-stocks has documented advantages in production rate, land use, and CO2 sequestration over the more developed liquid biofuel alternatives, including ethanol and plant oils. The efficient application of this technology requires the incorporation of core bioprocess engineering concepts, including gene regulation and microbial ecology, into microalgae-based biofuel reactor design. The goal of this proposed research is to link gene regulation with microalgae function to design and produce robust mixed consortia microalgae reactors that maximize volumetric lipid content. Specific objectives include the following: (i) sequence genes involved in microalgae lipid production and build gene expression microarrays, (ii) determine the effects of CO2 concentration, pH, and other environmental conditions on the gene regulation and ability of microalgae to synthesize lipids, (iii) investigate process conditions that select for lipid producing microalgae stains in reactors using unsterile feed solutions, and (iv) integrate the experimental work with an evaluation of the environmental and economic impacts of producing biofuels from microalgae.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The potential sustainability of microalgae fuel production, coupled with the limited knowledge of how to design and operate efficient, robust CO2 uptake and lipid synthesis systems, provide a strong rationale for investigating microalgae genetics and microbial ecology. The major outcome of this research is fundamental and applied information that directs the design, stable operation, and sustainability of microalgae-based biofuel reactors. Beyond these tangible outcomes, the proposed work is designed to make fundamental contributions toward this developing industry. These include producing gene sequence information and bioinformatics tools to enable further gene expression or genetic engineering research, providing a basis to understand how algal populations evolve under realistic microalgae biofuel reactor conditions, and ensuring the sustainability of the process by incorporating economic issues into microalgae biofuel technology development.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project promotes teaching and training through involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in research. Students from a broad cross section of disciplines will become involved in a multi-year project to design, operate, and test a variety of research hypotheses on two continuously operated, unsterile microalgae reactors. In addition to providing long term information to inform the research section of this proposed work, the project will span six different courses and is expected to produce a campus-wide opportunity for student involvement in alternative biofuel development, regardless of the student's course of study."

This clade offers an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the effects of deep time paleogeographic transformations and periods of global climate change on lineage diversification and facilitation of adaptive radiation. With over 100 species, the Antarctic notothenioid radiation has been the subject of intensive investigation of biochemical, physiological, and morphological adaptations associated with freezing avoidance in the subzero Southern Ocean marine habitats. However, broadly sampled time-calibrated phylogenetic hypotheses of notothenioids have not been used to examine patterns of adaptive radiation in this clade. The goals of this project are to develop an intensive phylogenomic scale dataset for 90 of the 124 recognized notothenioid species, and use this genomic resource to generate time-calibrated molecular phylogenetic trees. The results of pilot phylogenetic studies indicate a very exciting correlation of the initial diversification of notothenioids with the fragmentation of East Gondwana approximately 80 million years ago, and the origin of the Antarctic Clade adaptive radiation at a time of global cooling and formation of polar conditions in the Southern Ocean, approximately 35 million years ago. This project will provide research experiences for undergraduates, training for a graduate student, and support a post doctoral researcher. In addition the project will include three high school students from New Haven Public Schools for summer research internships."

This project aims to uncover the causes of, and the paths to, the mortgage crisis from the experience of a major mortgage bank. The bank the PI's study is an ideal place for the study because it provides a epresentative and yet amplified version of the boom-and-bust cycle that the national subprime sector has seen during the past decade. First, the bank was one of the nations ten largest mortgage banks in 2006 and was one of the fastest growing. Second,it specialized in the reduced- and no-documentation loans that has been central to the mortgage crisis, while also providing full-documentation loans. Third, the insolvency of the bank in 2008 was one of the largest bank failures in United States history. Lastly, the borrowers and properties underlying the bank's mortgage loans have fair representations from all the states, and therefore, lessons from the bank's failure have general implications. <br/>The project will be based on a new and proprietary data set that represents the most comprehensive, detailed, and disaggregated data sets used in the mortgage loan literature. We have obtained data on more than 700,000 loans made by the bank that were outstanding at any time between January 2004 and March 2008. The dataset includes all the detailed information that the lender collected for loan origination, including loan pricing and other contractual terms, and the borrowers demographic and economic conditions. In addition, the dataset includes detailed information about the loan performance in each month during the sample period, including the payment amount and the loans prepayment, delinquency and foreclosure status. Finally, using the address information in the dataset, the PI's are able to match individual loans to community attributes such as school quality, housing price indices, and business opportunities in narrow localities. <br/>The analysis of this unique dataset will include several steps. First, the PI's plan to conduct a descriptive analysis of the evolution of the structuring and performance of loans originated by the bank during the sample period. Second, they will perform a predictive analysis of default, and analyze the differences in the determinants of default among subsamples partitioned by loan types and borrower characteristics. They will also analyze the time series variations of such. Most importantly, they will identify the two-sided moral hazard problems in the mortgage market. On the one hand, there is the possibility of predatory lending, where the lender misleads an uninformed borrower into a high-cost loan when the latter could qualify for a lower-cost alternative; or the lender makes a loan that will cause expected harm to the borrower. On the other hand, predatory borrowing points to the possibility that borrowers falsify or hide unfavorable information in their loan applications. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity: Using a unique dataset, the proposed study will help settle the controversies over lending practice, most importantly the presence of discrimination in loan pricing and predatory lending. The research also aims at identifying key factors in causing the mortgage crisis by assessing the relative importance of irresponsible lending and irresponsible borrowing. The novel empirical design to separately identify the opportunistic behavior of lenders and borrowers will also represent a contribution to the empirical literature on two-sided information asymmetry and moral hazard. <br/><br/>The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity: By conducting an inside study of a major mortgage bank through its expansion and failure, this work will provide a better understanding of the causes of the recent mortgage crisis. The findings will provide useful reference for policy makers who work on laws and rules in order to prevent a crisis of this scale from recurring. The lessons from this study will also benefit banks and financial institutions for better practices in loan provision and securitization, risk management, and monitoring. <br/>"

The field is now just fifty years old. The overarching agenda of this conference is to consider what medical anthropology has contributed to basic scientific research  and to create new research agendas and collaborations for the future. <br/><br/>The four day conference will be anchored by thirteen plenary speakers who will highlight the potential for future research in the most significant research areas. The speakers will report on the social science of health research from a variety of perspetives, including inequality, science and technology, genomics, bioethics, and the science of public policy. The conference also will provide a forum for the dissemination of new findings and the development of international collaborations through research working group sessions.  A special student poster session will provide an opportunity for senior medical anthropologists to offer constructive feedback to the next generation of scientists.  <br/><br/>This conference is important because the last half-century of research has shown that across the globe, social and cultural institutions, not just medical practice, have significant influence in human and community health. This conference will bring together the very best researchers in this area to move the field forward at a time of critical need."

These materials undergo a martensitic phase transformation from one crystallographic structure to another and provide large actuation forces. Despite these interesting properties the integration of shape memory alloys in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is limited because the details of the phase transformation that activates the shape changes is very sensitive to microstructural details. For example a small increase in grain size significantly changes the actuation force and the transformation temperature. In addition, the mechanical behavior of NiTi in thin-film form differs from the bulk and is a largely unexplored research topic. Objectives of this program are to evaluate  the effects of grain structure, grain size and grain-size distributions on phase transformation temperatures, hysteresis behavior, actuation properties, and mechanical properties. Accordingly, we will explore the crystallization behavior of NiTi thin films and nanostructures; and broaden the understanding of thin film mechanical properties by examining materials that exhibit elastic nonlinearities. Structure-property relationships will be studied by observing microstructural development using in situ transmission electron microscopy. Evolution of the and grain structure will be evaluated using the Johnson?Mehl?Avrami?Kolmogorov theory. The resulting actuation properties of the engineered microstructures will be studied with wafer curvature methods and MEMS-based cantilevers; and the transformation temperature changes will be investigated with differential scanning calorimetry. The dependence of mechanical properties on microstructure will be examined with nanoindentation. This study will provide novel observations of the behavior of thin film shape memory materials, and provide guidance for their adoption into MEMS.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Knowledge of the link between phase transformations, microstructure, and mechanical properties will be studied in thin films by observing a new class of materials that undergo a martensitic (i.e. displacive) transformation. From this work, we will improve the fundamental understanding of thin-film shape memory alloys and learn how to control their properties in a predictable way, thereby illuminating the role of microstructure on the thermodynamics of martensitic transformations. This ability to control properties will benefit the MEMS community and enable future devices. Additionally, these materials provide a model to hone the ability to tailor microstructures and will benefit other research pursuits in amorphous silicon, amorphous carbon, and metallic glasses. This program?s broader impact consists of stimulating the interest in science for a range of individuals from the training of graduate students to the encouragement of school children. A revamped introductory materials science class that includes hands-on demonstrations and real-world examples will cultivate engineers with strong materials backgrounds. A compilation of classroom demonstrations disseminated on the web will serve a wider learning community. This educational program also provides informal opportunities to change the perception of science via a lecture series that showcases diverse scientists and presents enjoyable science events. The aim is to encourage all students, particularly students of color and girls, to consider science as a career. It furnishes richer connections to science for school children, their teachers, and their parents and is a simple model that can be extended within and between universities. By leveraging a partnership with the NISE network, this program will have large dissemination channels. Leaving no student behind, this program seeks to capture the attention of non-science majors in a liberal-arts environment by using them as demonstrators to teach science in a compelling way."

Their interface is of particular relevance to Wyoming as the leading US state in the exportation of energy but having major water limitations. As a model for illustrating principles of complexity and uncertainty in science, the energy-water interface presents a relevant framework to enhance STEM learning outcomes. In addition, like many rural, frontier states, Wyoming faces distinct challenges with respect to STEM awareness, education, and career opportunities. And a significant proportion of the state population can be categorized as at-risk relative to socio-economic status and educational achievement. These challenges will be addressed through a partnership between schools, the University, and the private sector using a diverse portfolio of activities designed to increase learning outcomes of doctoral fellows, 7-10 grade students and teachers, to inform career choice through motivating STEM experiences, and to institutionalize GK12 goals in the graduate education infrastructure of UW. Specific deliverables from this project include: inquiry based curricular units, summer research experiences, diverse workshops, multiple training events, sustained cyberinfrastructure interactions, and global research opportunities.  This program will promote the competitive success of the future STEM workforce by providing training in leadership, communication and project management skills for graduate fellows, by enhancing the educational pipeline through motivational awareness units, through sustained professional development of teachers, and by development of new interdisciplinary graduate programs focused on GK12 objectives.<br/>   <br/> <br/>"

In this project, a multidisciplinary team of investigators will design, test and implement new tools to analyze data obtained by means of the recently developed technique of mass spectrometry imaging applied to the mapping of peptides and proteins in biological tissues. Application of these new methods will yield detailed maps of the temporal and spatial distributions of thousands of individual molecules and the capacity to examine patterns of expression as well as correlations in expression within ensembles of molecules. These new methods will be developed and tested first in simple model organisms, to characterize and compare the molecular components in the embryonic, adult and regenerating nervous system. Later, they will be applied in studies of mammalian nervous system slices in order to answer, among other questions, how stem cells are intercalated into and how they mature in adult nervous systems, during normal replacement or artificial replacement following cell loss due to disease or aging. All computational and bioinformatic tools developed in the course of this project will be made available openly to other scientists.

However, recent studies suggest that microorganisms with previously unknown capabilities for harnessing solar energy, the so-called photoheterotrophs, are abundant in the oceans and are present in freshwater ecosystems as well. In contrast to algae, which completely depend on chlorophyll-based photosynthesis for their growth, photoheterotrophs use pigments called rhodopsins and bacteriochlorophylls to convert solar energy into a food supplement to their predominant diet of ingested organic matter. The aim of this project is to discover, describe, and document the predominant organisms that make up this unusual group of phytoplankton in temperate freshwater lakes. <br/>Due to their light-harvesting capacity and amenability to genetic engineering, photoheterotrophs may be useful in future bioenergy production systems.  Research results will provide baseline information for freshwater phytoplankton bioprospecting, in a search for potentially useful microorganisms.  The broader impacts of this work also include further development of cutting-edge research technologies, such as the study of a complete genome of a single cell, infrared epifluorescence microscopy for visualizing phytoplankton, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate and study phytoplankton cells for experiments.  One postdoctoral associate and up to three undergraduate students will be trained during the course of the project, with particular effort placed on recruiting Native American students.

It addresses how these foreland arches form and how they are linked to plate tectonic processes. The research in the Rocky Mountain Bighorn Arch of northern Wyoming and southern Montana combines geological investigations of surface geometries and kinematic indicators with geophysical imaging of 3D crustal and upper mantle geometries from an active/passive seismic experiment. The resulting 4D (3D spatial and temporal), lithospheric-scale model of foreland arch deformation tests current hypotheses for basement-involved foreland thrust belts both in the Rockies and in active orogens of Asia and the Andes. These hypotheses include: 1) fault blocks defined by lithosphere-penetrating thrust faults, 2) subhorizontal detachment within the crust, 3) lithospheric buckling, and 4) pure shear lithospheric thickening. Our investigation to determine the mechanism driving basement-involved arch formation is advancing our understanding of continental lithospheric rheology. <br/><br/> This three year (2009-12) collaborative project defines a lithospheric volume of 1.5 x106 km3 by integrating arch-scale upper crustal geometries derived from surface exposures and petroleum industry subsurface data (Eric Erslev, University of Wyoming; Christine Siddoway, Colorado College) with the results of a hybrid seismic experiment. The passive component of this experiment consists of a 1.25 year (2009-10) deployment of 27 broadband seismometers that densify the EarthScope transportable array (Megan Anderson, Colorado College), a 6.5 month deployment of 220 short period seismometers (Anne Sheehan, University of Colorado), and a 9 day deployment of 800 high frequency ""Texan"" seismometers (Kate Miller, University of Texas at El Paso). The active component consists of 9 shots (summer 2010) recorded by the above instruments and an additional 1600 ""Texan"" seismometers deployed for 5 days. These instruments are arrayed in a grid consisting of three SW-NE lines and two NW-SE lines with a total line length of 1000 km. Joint inversion of active and passive results defines crustal and upper mantle velocities and interface structures within the Bighorn Arch. These new seismic results are integrated (2010-12) within a GIS-based, 3D geospatial framework including data from exposures, geologic maps and industry subsurface data for the study area. Kinematic information from fracture transects (Erslev, Siddoway) and gravity modeling (Miller) is used to guide 3D, lithosphere-scale structural restorations to test the compatibility of different components in our 3D geometric model. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the Bighorn Project partially lies in the development of fundamental methods for quantitative integration of geological and seismological research. In addition, the Bighorn Project involves a broad range of geoscientists, including one post-doctoral fellow, 4 graduate students, and >15 undergraduates, who will participate in IRIS and Keck Consortium sponsored research. The results have key implications for energy resources, allowing the prediction of open fractures that are critical to hydrocarbon production. The development of a dramatic animation showing the 4D structural development of the Bighorns Arch during the Laramide Orogeny provides important public outreach."

Trajectories of natural environment change are commonly analyzed, but less studied is how environment change opens alternative social and economic paths, which paths are most desirable, and what actions are needed to sustain them. How do Arctic communities remain viable and what are the implications for human capital development?  Is the Arctic mixed economy, consisting of wage and subsistence activities, sustainable or is the Arctic transitioning to a predominantly industrial, wage economy?  This project will help communities, workers, and businesses address these issues through analysis of current and prospective patterns of human capital development and careers in the major Arctic industries. As part of the the International Polar Research research initiative, this project will develop ?linked,? tripartite case studies of industry, workers, and communities and use videography as both research tool and as a means for community members to document and analyze ongoing changes. <br/><br/>Central to the study are the following issues:  How do communities sustain their coherence and even existence in the face of climate change, of industrial economic development, and of employment and education opportunities that appear to draw off their younger members?  How do individual workers develop skills and careers in highly seasonal work and/or while maintaining subsistence activity and traditional community participation?  How do businesses sustain and grow their activities, develop and fully utilize available human capital, and adapt to changing climate conditions and to economic growth opportunities?  Case studies include: fish processing in St. Paul/Pribilof Islands and oil and gas field services in the North Slope Borough. The Tribal Government of St. Paul will partner in the Aleut/fish processing case study; in the North Slope Borough, Barrow Arctic Science Consortium will partner in the research and several oilfield service companies have agreed to participate.<br/><br/>The important social benefits will be insights into sustainability of careers, businesses, and communities in the face of climate, social, and economic change.  It will provide multiple perspectives on the impact of climate change on human and economic activity.  Partnering with Native communities is an integral part of the methodology to document and assess the role of workforce development in future directions of community development. Video will be used to document and archive contemporary conditions as part of the historical record as well as providing raw ?data? for each community and for future research. The video capability developed in the communities and the technical assistance and participatory research will support ongoing education within and between communities as well as outreach to schools and the public outside the Arctic.<br/>"

These models involve nonlinear partial differential equations such as reaction-diffusion equations, which may be coupled to the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics.  The proposed research aims at improving our understanding of the effects of fluid motion on combustion and has two main goals.  The first is a continuation of current work on passive combustion in periodic media as well as development of new techniques applicable to general disordered media.  The questions to be addressed include the effect of geometric properties of periodic flows on speed-up of propagation of reaction as well as the phenomenon of quenching.  We will also investigate propagation of reaction in disordered media, in particular, the existence of traveling front solutions and asymptotic approach of arbitrary solutions to these special ones.  The second main goal is the study of active combustion with direct feedback of reaction on the fluid motion via the buoyancy force.  Models incorporating such feedback, particularly relevant in highly turbulent combustion regimes, involve reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid dynamics equations and are inherently very complex.  We will focus our efforts on the existence and stability of traveling fronts, bounds on the speed of propagation of reaction, and gravity-induced mixing.  In addition, we intend to apply the developed techniques to the study of phase transitions in a related model of liquid suspensions. <br/><br/>The problems addressed by the project involve rich and subtle mathematics but also have an interdisciplinary character.  Reaction processes such as burning in internal combustion engines, nuclear reactions in stars, forest fires, and production of ozone in the atmosphere are ubiquitous in nature, science, and engineering.  Motion of the underlying liquid or gaseous medium often plays a crucial role by either speeding up reaction or quenching it.  The proposed research aims at a better mathematical understanding of the effects of various properties of the resulting turbulent flows on reactive processes.  It is relevant to branches of science such as astrophysics, biology, environmental science, and chemical engineering, and may provide useful qualitative insights in real life phenomena.  The principal investigator also plans to teach an undergraduate-level course as part of the Research Experience for Undergraduates summer program at the University of Chicago, as well as a specialized graduate-level course in reaction-diffusion equations."

New species and distribution records continue to be discovered, yet scorpions are increasingly threatened by habitat destruction and harvesting for the souvenir and exotic pet trades.  Scorpion research is hampered by infrequent application of modern concepts and techniques. This project will use genetic and anatomical data to revise a diverse and medically important genus of New World scorpions, the bark scorpions, Centruroides. Fieldwork will be conducted to discover new species, document distributions, and gather fresh material. The taxonomy will be revised based on objective analysis, and a monograph on the entire genus will be produced.<br/> <br/>Identifying and defining Centruroides species is problematic. The characters traditionally used often overlap between closely related species, are vaguely defined, and often vary within a population. It may be difficult even for specialists to identify species. Without a sound taxonomy, it is thus impossible to determine which species are medically important and dangerous to prepare and administer anti-venom. This project will produce revised species descriptions and interactive identification keys, illustrated with digital images and links to maps of species distributions, for all Centruroides. An expert in scorpion systematics will be trained, and results will be disseminated via the Internet for use by medical professionals and the public. <br/>"

As with other organisms in this region, the diversity and endemism of Indo-Pacific scorpions is high. This project investigates the diversity, evolution and biogeography of the scorpion family Liochelidae in the Indo-Pacific, using anatomical and molecular data. Liochelid scorpions are ideal model organisms for evolutionary and biogeographical studies due to their restricted dispersal ability, specific habitat requirements and high rate of endemism. Congruence between the evolutionary history of these scorpions and geotectonic events during the last 35 million years will be assessed using molecular clocks.<br/><br/>The urgency of surveying, inventorying and describing the biota of the Indo-Pacific region cannot be underemphasized given the rapid destruction of natural habitats and accelerating extinction of species. Liochelid scorpions, which mostly inhabit threatened tropical forests, are good indicators of environmental disturbance and areas of endemism. A synthesis of their diversity and distribution will provide data for conservation and biodiversity management in the Indo-Pacific. The biogeographical analysis presented by this project will also provide data for geologists, who increasingly rely on such studies to corroborate geological hypotheses."

The AU-SETH partner provides a Master of Arts in Teaching in Secondary Education: Mathematics, with emphasis on teaching math and the challenges of a high needs district. AU-M/S provides graduate level math courses, including a course focusing on secondary school math content. The AU program encompasses 18 credits in pedagogy, 15 credits in math content courses, and 500 hours of teaching and observing in the classrooms of outstanding secondary school math teachers. CASE is providing fundraising and organizational efforts (such as recruitment and mentoring and professional development during the four teaching years), and is coordinating activities with the MfA organization in New York. The participating district is providing Fellows the opportunity to observe and teach during their training and teaching years, cooperating in the certification process, and ensuring access to available teaching positions after the training year. <br/><br/>The program is serving as a test of the idea that a teacher's deep content knowledge can enhance secondary school students' understanding and learning of math. The experiences of the Fellows are contributing important information concerning the pedagogical training and support needed to make STEM professionals effective teachers for high needs students. Findings are being shared with the local and national education communities through presentations at meetings and scholarly publications. The program goals address the national need to improve the education of disadvantaged youth so that they can complete high school, aspire to college and productive employment, and become contributing citizens. The program's association with the MfA program is, with other MfA  cities, serving to amplify the impact and expand the data that can inform math education improvement nationwide."

Courtney Smith, PI; Martin Flajnik, Co-PI<br/>IOS-0905197<br/>International Travel for Students and Postdocs to attend ISDCI-11 in Prague<br/><br/>Funding will be used to support international travel support for students and postdocs in US laboratories to attend the 11th Congress of the International Society of Developmental and Comparative Immunology (ISDCI-11) to be held in Prague, Czech Republic, from June 28 to July 4, 2009.  These funds will be important for several reasons.  1) The budget for the Society alone for the previous two meetings (2003, 2006) was not enough to provide significant travel bursaries for students and postdocs.  Travel costs are expected to be increased for the Congress in Prague.  2) Because funding for research in the US is difficult to obtain, it is expected that fewer numbers of students and postdocs will have access to travel support from research grants.  3) NSF funding for students and postdocs in US labs will enable the Society to shift some of their funds to support students from other countries.  Overall, this will aid all students and enable more to attend, which will benefit the students and post docs, and will benefit the Society through the influx of new ideas and new members.<br/><br/>Students and postdocs who have attended ISDCI meetings in the past have benefited in a number of important ways.  These included: 1) the experience of presenting their data at an international meeting for the first time, 2) the opportunity to meet and talk to other scientists with common interests in comparative immunology, 3) the opportunity to receive feedback on their research from leaders in the field, 4) the opportunity to meet their future mentors and collaborators, 5) the opportunity to experience the Society and to participate in this collegial and supportive community of scientists.  These benefits will be available to students and postdocs at Prague.<br/><br/>The attendance by students and postdocs at the ISDCI meetings brings significant benefits to the Society.  1) Often, students and postdocs decide while at the ISDCI meetings to remain in the field of comparative immunology.  This increases the membership in the Society.  2) The younger scientists are often those who bring to the Society new ideas and new approaches for tackling hard scientific problems.  This injection of new results maintains vibrant research progress by all members of the Society.  3) Attendance by students at the Congress provides opportunities for the full members of the Society to identify future postdocs to work in their labs.  4) It is quite possible, that some of the students supported to attend ISDCI-11 may be the ISDCI officers of the future.  For example, the current ISDCI Secretary of Education (the PI) received funding as a postdoc to attend the 5th ISDCI Congress in Portland OR in 1991.<br/><br/>"

Nature has evolved efficient strategies, exemplified in the mineralized tissues of numerous species, to synthesize materials that often exhibit exceptional mechanical properties. These biological systems demonstrate the ability to control nano- and microstructural features that significantly improve the mechanical performance of otherwise brittle materials. One such example is found in the hyper-mineralized combative dactyl club of the stomatopods, a group of highly aggressive marine crustaceans. This ultrahard organic-inorganic composite structure is capable of inflicting significant damage following impact with a wide variety of biomineralized structures (e.g., mollusk shells, crab exoskeletons, the skulls of small fish). This project combines expertise in a number of areas including biologically inspired materials synthesis, structural characterization, mechanical testing, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, protein-mineral interaction modeling, and a thorough knowledge of the biological system to be studied. Using these approaches, the project will investigate the structure-property relationships of the hyper-mineralized stomatopod dactyl clubs and elucidate the primary toughening mechanisms of these unique composite materials through the following potentially transformational investigations: (1) A detailed, three-dimensional map of the nano- and microstructural features, with specific mineral composition and phase information. (2) A complementary mechanical investigation of the regional structures. (3) In-vitro mineralization experiments to understand organic-inorganic interactions that control mineral composition and phase.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  This strongly interdisciplinary research has the potential to enable significant progress in the emerging fields of nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing by exploiting control mechanisms established by nature to make novel materials and devices exhibiting paradigm-shifting properties. By investigating the structure-property relationships of these unique impact-tolerant mineralized structures using modern chemical, morphological, and mechanical characterization techniques, the long-term aim will be to develop the necessary tools for the design and fabrication of cost-effective and environmentally friendly engineering materials that mimic the various design elements and performance properties present in biological systems.  The PI, a new faculty member at UC Riverside, has demonstrated an ability to attract a diverse group of students to his lab.  Of the six graduate students, three are female.  He has 12 undergraduates working in his lab, including four females, four Hispanics, and two African Americans.  The co-PI has an equally strong record in attracting a diverse group of students. The UC Riverside campus is noted for its success in attracting underrepresented minorities to a Research I environment and seeing them complete their studies successfully.  Encouragement of undergraduate research is an important component of this success, and both PIs are making strong contributions. Although not required of proposals submitted prior to January 5, 2009, the proposal describes a clear and effective plan for training of the postdoctoral who will be trained on the project.  The PI has also described plans for involving high school students and teachers from the diverse community surrounding the university in his research.  A web camera set up in the Kisailus lab will enable students in local and more distant high schools to observe the stomatopod rearing facilities and the experimental research as it progresses.<br/>"

These metabolites are also of medical importance due to their documented anti-oxidant and anti-cancer properties in humans. Extensive molecular and biochemical characterization of the pathway responsible for the synthesis of phenylpropanoids, combined with recent insights into the physiological functions of the metabolites themselves, make this an ideal system to address fundamental questions about cellular metabolism using an integrative, multidisciplinary approach to place these molecular and biochemical events into a physiological context. Understanding the controls of this pathway will provide insights into engineering the synthesis of phenylpropanoids and other plant metabolites, both for improving plant growth and facilitating the production of these important compounds for the nutritional and dietary enhancement of crops. <br/> In this Arabidopsis 2010 project, six research groups will come together in a unique discovery effort, involving the establishment of biological framework models that integrate gene expression, protein expression, and metabolite production into a comprehensive map of phenylpropanoid function, signaling, and metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana. This project addresses the priorities of the 2010 project by collecting one of the first unified sets of time course gene expression, protein expression, and metabolite data and then use emerging computational methods to combine these comprehensive data sets in order to create testable models of integrated biological networks. This project combines modeling, theory, and experimentation to produce a systems-level understanding of the hormonal controls of the transcriptional and regulatory mechanisms controlling phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Research results from this project will be made widely accessible to the public through publication and through construction of an information-rich website at http:// www.phenylpropanoid2010.wfu.edu. This project will result in interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. In addition, the PIs will partner with local and national groups to enhance science education, including development of K-12 student and teacher experiences and providing research opportunities for individuals from groups underrepresented in science.  <br/>"

PHAs are microbially produced, biobased, and biodegradable polymers that have properties similar to petroleum-based polymers.  Substitution of petroleum-based plastics with PHAs could alleviate many of the pollution problems associated with non-biodegradable plastics. PHA polyesters can be divided into several classes with different physical properties based on their monomer composition. Short-chain-length (SCL) PHAs consist of repeating units with 3-5 carbons and have thermoplastic properties.  Medium-chain-length (MCL) PHAs consist of repeating units with 6-12 carbons and have elastomeric properties.  SCL-MCL PHAs consist of repeating units of 4-12 carbons and have a wide range of physical properties dependent on their molar ratio of SCL to MCL monomers. Currently, the ability to produce MCL and SCL-MCL PHA polymers from unrelated carbon sources in recombinant organisms is limited due to low activity of potential MCL monomer-supplying enzymes.  There are two main objectives for the proposed research: (1) Use of engineered bacteria harboring synthetic metabolic pathways to efficiently produce SCL and MCL copolymers from unrelated carbon sources; and (2) the alteration of the substrate specificity and specific activity of enzymes for the supply of PHA monomers to produce novel copolymer formulations. Enzyme engineering using random, error-prone PCR and rational design based on known crystal structures of enzymes will be used for the production of improved PHA monomer-supplying enzymes for the production of novel biodegradable polymers.<br/><br/>Plastics are invaluable materials that are used to produce many essential items in modern society.  Most current plastics are derived from petroleum, which is a limited resource.  There are many problems associated with petroleum-based plastics (pollution, waste disposal problems, greenhouse gas emission, competitive fuel utilization, etc.), which suggest that research in the area of biobased and biodegradable alternatives is of paramount importance. Studies supported by this research will use bacteria as ?microbial factories? for the production of biodegradable plastics from renewable, plant-based resources. By engineering proteins within the bacteria, we will be able to produce higher quantities of biobased plastics and produce new types of biobased plastics with improved material properties.  The work will yield new and detailed insights into how biodegradable plastics are produced in cells. Completion of the proposed research could have dramatic impacts on curtailing a variety of urban pollution issues caused by petroleum-based plastics.<br/>"

(Bioactivity here denotes the ability of these materials to bond to bone and ultimately to promote bone growth and development, including osteoblast differentiation, proliferation, viability, and mineralization.)  The inherent complexity and the lack of long-range order limit our understanding of the structure of multi-component glasses that are important in fields such as biomedical applications. Through development of innovative methodology and integration of experimental and modeling studies, this project attacks two scientifically challenging problems: the structure of the complex multi-component oxide glasses and the dissolution mechanism of these glasses in an aqueous environment. Computer simulation methods such as classical molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations have generated a wealth of information about glass structure, but the results rely heavily on the quality of empirical potential models and validation on experimental results is usually needed. On the other hand, experimental methods such as neutron and X-ray diffraction, EXAFS, and infrared and Raman spectroscopy can probe certain aspects of the structure of glasses but are often limited to averaged short-range structures or mutually overlapping structural information. The novelty of the proposed new method lies in integrating classical or ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with the reverse Monte Carlo algorithm based on scattering data in studying the structure of glass materials, which will generate structural models that have more refined short- and medium-range structures for complex multi-component systems such as bioactive glasses. Based on these structural models, dissolution of bioactive glasses will be studied using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with input of reaction energy barriers and reaction pathways from ab initio DFT calculations.  The structural models and dissolution mechanisms obtained can guide more rational and systematic design of new glass compositions and processes for biomedical applications. This project involves intensive training of graduate and undergraduate students to master skills that combine multiscale materials modeling with state-of-the-art material characterization techniques, and thus prepares students for future careers that involve solving challenging materials problems.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  Potential applications of refined bioactive glasses in restoration and repair of bone represent an arena in which this research may have an important broader impact.  The PI describes a thoughtful commitment to understanding how students learn and to providing the kinds of hands-on experiences that implement this understanding.  He has developed a new course in Computational Materials Science based on a series of modules that develop students' understanding of materials phenomena and the underlying mechanisms and experimental methods.  He uses multimedia to explain crystal structures through three-dimensional visualization and manipulation, to illustrate crystal dislocations using movies of atomic scale simulations, and to convey the diffusion process through transition state theory and energy barrier calculations.  Another important way the PI involves students in advanced courses is to use literature based instruction.  Here he focuses on a group of classical and seminal papers, dissecting them and digesting them through class discussions, homework, and exams.  This teaches the students how to use the literature effectively to become qualified researchers.  The PI also involves undergraduates in his research lab, and the students who prepare the bioactive glass samples will have the opportunity to visit Argonne to participate in the scattering studies.  A Materials Day organized by the PI for Dallas-Fort Worth area high school teachers introduces the teachers to state of the art materials processing, characterization, and modeling facilities available on his campus.  He also conducts outreach to Latino and Native American students in the Fort Worth School District.  He is currently guiding science projects for students in the Texas Advanced Math and Science program, a two year residential early college entrance program for selected high school students.<br/>"

These spiders rely on silk for constructing burrows and trapdoors, without which they could not survive. Silk genes from different Aliatypus species will be sequenced to determine the relationships and rates of change among the genes. These results will reveal how silk evolves among closely-related species and how molecules adapt to local environmental conditions.<br/><br/>Due to its extraordinary mechanical properties, spider silk is being used to develop novel biomimetic materials that are tougher than Kevlar but also biodegradable. This research will help bioengineers understand which elements of silk sequences correspond to particular functions or environments. Additionally, understanding the dynamics of silk gene variation has relevance to other repetitive, structural proteins, such as biomedically important collagens, elastins, and amyloids.

While there is a large body of experimental work on polyelectrolyte complexation, much lagged behind is development of a reliable theoretical tool to describe the underlying structure and thermophysical properties. The theoretical predictions are important not only for engineering applications but also for understanding fundamental biological processes that involve association of oppositely charged biomacromolecules. The proposed research seeks to develop predictive models useful for quantifying structure and thermodynamic stability of polyelectrolyte complexes from a molecular perspective. The theoretical models will be validated with results from molecular simulations and well characterized experimental systems. A case study is also proposed to apply the theoretical tools for understanding genome packaging in viral capsids.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: <br/><br/>The theoretical techniques to be used in this research are built upon<br/>recent work in the PI's group in development and application of classical density functional theory (DFT). DFT provides a unifying computational tool for describing the microscopic structure and interfacial behavior of complex molecular systems. Preliminary investigations have demonstrated that it is able to capture both the local packaging and long range electrostatic and intra chain correlations essential for a successful description of strongly charged polyelectrolyte systems. The planned research focuses on development of complementary molecular models for investigating the structure and phase transitions of polyelectrolyte complexes. If successful, accomplishments from this work may open new avenues for understanding diverse molecular self assembly processes and thereby will transform industrial design and practice of both synthetic and natural polyelectrolyte systems.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The generic nature of the theoretical techniques proposed in this work promises applications not only to polyelectrolyte systems but also to the broader fields of complex fluids. In particular, development of advanced computational methods may have unusual impacts in fundamental research toward understanding the molecular basis of viral replication cycle that often entails strong interactions of DNA/RNA chains with oppositely charged polypeptides or proteins. Such understanding is essential for identification of potential drug targets for treatment of virus induced contagious diseases and for formulation of efficient gene/biopharmaceuticals health care delivery systems.<br/><br/>This project will provide opportunity for young scientists to gain interdisciplinary research experience and motivate their career interests in molecular modeling and engineering. In addition to supporting one senior graduate student toward his/her advanced degree, this project will recruit at least two undergraduate students from the University Honors Program (UHP) by offering research based thesis projects. Based on the introductory materials related to this research, the PI plans to prepare lectures and special seminars to introduce recent developments in viral self assembly and gene delivery. In addition to UHP, the introductory materials will also be used for the university FastStart summer academy program, designed for high-school students who aspire to biomedical and engineering careers"

The project develops materials describing a disciplined approach to time-oriented programming that emphasizes the use of state machines for computation and the explicit programmer management of time, described in teaching materials including an online book and extensively animated PowerPoint slides. Recognizing the key barriers to focusing on a disciplined approach, the project develops a virtual microcontroller, which is freed from the complex details of modern microcontrollers stemming from legacy or mass-production concerns, and which instead possesses simple input and output pins and a basic timer component with an intuitive programming interface. The virtual microcontroller is supported by a single compilation, simulation, and debug environment, eliminating the complexity involved with setting up and maintaining microcontroller tools. The teaching material is based on the virtual microcontroller, and a set of online lab exercises is also included. For physical implementation, the virtual microcontroller can be mapped to a variety of existing microcontrollers or even to PCs or field-programmable gate arrays, thus decoupling lab hardware from teaching materials. Follow-on courses or labs can then introduce students to low level details of microcontrollers as appropriate.<br/><br/>The project's developed materials define and support the appropriate abstraction for disciplined time-oriented programming, exposing low-level resources necessary for a solid bottom-up understanding of time-oriented programming (timers, interrupt service routines, processor cycles), hiding minutia that detracts attention from higher-level concepts, describing a disciplined synchronous state machine approach. The coordinated materials enable any instructor to introduce disciplined time-oriented embedded programming into a computing curriculum as early as the freshmen year without concern for complex lab setups or of overwhelming students with low-level hardware/software details. The net result is that disciplined time-oriented programming methods can be introduced earlier and to a larger audience."

Bumble bees maintain a tight association of their life cycle (e.g., colony growth and development; behavior) with seasonal changes in light. The main hypothesis of this project is that photoperiod is a cue that a bumble bee colony uses to shift through consecutive steps during its life cycle. This hypothesis will be evaluated from three different perspectives using the North American native bumble bee Bombus impatiens. First, this study will determine the effects of photoperiod on colony development through manipulations of the Light/Dark cycle. Second, the effect of photoperiod on individual behavior will be quantified using video recording analysis.  Third, the study will characterize differences in the molecular components of the circadian clock using gene expression and clock protein localization in the bumble bee brain. It is expected that treatments with increasing day length will produce larger colonies and a synchronized production of new males and queens. At the molecular level is it predicted that changes in photoperiod will correlate with changes in clock gene expression profiles and will affect the localization of clock proteins in the brain. This project will integrate behavioral research and molecular analysis to yield a basic but complete overview of the effects of photoperiod on the social organization and life cycle of B. impatiens. Bumblebees are important pollinators of crops and other plants.  In recent decades there has been a worldwide reduction in the populations of bumble bees, and of pollinators in general.

Molecular shape is a fundamental property governing phase behavior. The concept of excluded volume describes a region of space that one molecule prevents another from entering.  Reducing excluded volume gives molecules more freedom of motion and thus increases entropy. Consequently molecules are influenced to undergo phase transitions that have molecular configurations which minimize excluded volume. In order to reveal the role of entropy in phase transitions the PI will create shape amphiphiles or entropic surfactants, molecules composed of two parts that separately have a tendency to phase separate, but which are bound together forming a block co-polymer. Two experimental systems will be created. The first colloid will be formed of blocks of the filamentous virus fd, a long, thin, semi-flexible polymer that forms liquid crystals and DNA, a polymer too flexible to form liquid crystals. The second system will be PRINT particles ? nanosized colloids produced by a high throughput molding technology developed by collaborator, Joseph. DeSimone. The phase behavior of these systems will be studied, as well as the phase behavior of mixtures of the shape amphiphiles with the individual components. Entropy is the dominant feature controlling the phase behavior of these charge stabilized colloids.  Because of the size, shape, and simplicity of the interparticle interactions this system can be theoretically modeled and simulated with high precision. To study the phase behavior of shape amphiphiles the PI will employ a microfluidic device, the PhaseChip, which can precisely meter, mix, and store sub-nanoliter amounts of sample, solvent, and other reagents. Tens of thousands of individual mixtures can be stored on a chip in individual wells. Each well is in contact with a reservoir through a membrane through which only water can pass, but not salt, polymer, or amphiphile. This enables the concentration of all solutes in a sample to be reversibly, rapidly, and precisely varied.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  This project has important scientific implications in terms of what will be learned about the factors that drive self assembly and determine the ultimate architecture of the assemblies.  The proposal describes an already highly developed program for interdisciplinary training of Brandeis life science and biophysics graduate students, including an IGERT in Quantitative Biology.  Undergraduate participation in research is actively encouraged, and both graduate and undergraduate students learn to incorporate microfluidics technology into life sciences research.  The PI is involved in K-12 outreach through the Brandeis POSSE program designed to bring inner city students to Brandeis and to encourage and support their success in the sciences.<br/>"

The east African rift valley lakes may be the only high-productivity, low-nutrient freshwater ecosystems. The profusion of life in these lakes is concentrated at their edges, where sufficient light reaches the lake bottom to allow for high rates of photosynthesis of the algae growing on the rocks.  But how is high algal productivity maintained in the face of 1) the extreme scarcity of critical nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in the environment and 2) the intense grazing pressure imposed by high densities and rich diversity of herbivorous fish?  The answer may lie in the grazing fish themselves.  The hypothesis that the negative impacts of fish on their algal food resource are offset by the positive effects of fish on nutrient availability will be tested. Lab and field experiments will be used to test whether fish promote ecosystem productivity by 1) slowing the loss of nutrients to deeper waters by storing nutrients in their bodies; 2) rapidly recycling dietary nutrients between algae, animals, and the environment; and 3) promoting the growth of types of algae that are able to use and retain forms of nutrients unavailable to most algal species. Thus, algae-eating fish may encourage the growth of their own food resources by speeding up the nutrient cycle, stockpiling nutrients, and increasing the influx of new nutrients into the ecosystem.  Testing the importance of fish in sustaining lake productivity requires measuring nutrient storage and recycling by fish, experimentally testing whether algae grow faster when fish are present, measuring inputs of nutrients from the depths of the lake, and using theoretical models to compare the importance of fish and other nutrient inputs.  This combination of activities will be pursued both under field conditions in Africa and in laboratories in the United States.<br/><br/>This project will help to guide efforts to protect the hundreds of unique species and the globally-important fishery of Lake Tanganyika by clarifying two critical issues.  First, fishermen are catching too many fish in many lakes worldwide, including Lake Tanganyika.  This overharvest may remove too many nutrients from the lake, or reduce the rate of nutrient recycling so that algae grow more slowly.  By that mechanism, fishing could actually undercut the future productivity of the lake.  Second, climate change is warming the surface waters of the lake and reducing the seasonal winds that cause cold, nutrient rich waters to periodically well up from the depths of the lake. Reduction in the frequency of influx of these deep-water nutrients is cutting off the algal growth that sustains the fish.  This research will offer the first thorough evaluation of how these human-imposed factors will affect the productivity of Lake Tanganyika, which supports a regional human economy. The project will increase public awareness of Lake Tanganyika?s aquatic life through a website, an article for an aquarium hobbyist magazine, and a popular science article.  Finally, many students from Wright State University and the University of Michigan will gain professional experience through involvement in the project.  This will include students from Africa as well as Americans. Partnerships with African and global non-profit organizations will further broaden the impact of the research.<br/>"

When designing an emissions trading program, one of the most contentious issues a policymaker faces is the question of how to allocate emissions permits to stakeholders. How permits are allocated can have significant implications for both who bears the costs and how the required emissions reductions are achieved. Although the theoretical literature addressing the efficiency and distributional implications of permit allocation design has become quite sophisticated, empirical research is limited. The proposed work brings a detailed understanding of the electricity and cement industries, two major polluters, careful empirical analysis of firm-level decision making, and state-of-the-art econometric methods to bear on this first-order policy question.<br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>This project advances the literature at the interface of industrial organization and environmental regulation in several important ways. First, the researchers propose a novel source of exogenous variation to identify the effects of the permit allocation design decision on short-run firm behavior by exploiting panel data variation in allocation rules in the NOx Budget Program (NBP). This provides a unique opportunity to cleanly estimate the short-run response of firms to a full range of allocation mechanisms. The proposed research also investigates long-run dynamic effects of these regulations. Previous work in this area has largely focused on non-strategic simulation models of the industry using calibrated parameters. This project extends this literature through the use a fully-strategic equilibrium model of industry behavior based on econometrically-based parameters. Finally, the project makes an important contribution in its application of methodologies developed in the industrial organization literature on dynamic games to policy-revelent questions in the field of environmental economics.<br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Social Impact: Research findings would directly inform the design and implementation of future market-based environmental policies. The research provides evidence on the magnitude and direction of firms' responses to alternative emissions permit market designs. The proposed integration of empirics and applied theory will yield insights into how the permit allocation design decision can affect producer profits, consumer welfare, and the ability of the permit market to efficiently coordinate emissions abatement activities in real-world regulatory environments.<br/>Educational impact: Students working on this project will acquire hands on experience working with rich firm-level data sets, and build core competencies in applied econometrics and industrial organization. Both researchers will present research findings at academic and policy conferences and look forward to integrating research results into their graduate course curricula. Both MIT and UM have programs designed to integrate undergraduates into ongoing research. This project will nicely complement these undergraduate research<br/>programs."

In particular, the Fellow will adapt Kwan and colleagues? recent model of self-enhancement bias which emphasizes that two factors need to be considered to accurately estimate an individual?s self-enhancement (or effacement) bias. That is, self-perceptions must be compared both to how an individual perceives people in general (i.e., perceiver effect) and how others consensually perceive the behavior of the target individual (i.e., target effect).<br/>The Postdoctoral Fellow will extend this SRM-based approach to cultural research by including both in-group and out-group perceptions. She will be able to examine three kinds of differences between Asian and European Americans within one comprehensive design: perceiver effects (e.g., do Asians generally perceive people more critically or negatively? Do Asians only perceive other Asians more critically?), target effects (e.g., do Asians score lower in certain desirable social characteristics?), and various aspects of self-enhancement bias (e.g., do Asians perceive themselves in self-enhancing or self-effacing ways? Do biased self-perceptions affect adjustment in a positive or negative way?). She will compare conclusions derived from the two earlier conceptions of self-enhancement (namely the social comparison and the self-insight perspective) and then test whether Asian self-perceptions are realistic, self-enhancing, or self-effacing. Finally, the Fellow will study the academic and social consequences of self-perception biases in college students of different ethnic backgrounds.<br/>To test these hypotheses, the Fellow will use a repeated-measures design in which participants rate their own behavior and the behavior of the other group members in a specific group interaction context. In a round-robin design, Asian and European American participants (assigned to 6-person groups) will provide ratings of self and others on several positively and negatively-valenced behavioral attributes, as well as social adjustment variables such as liking and interpersonal closeness. Furthermore, the mixed ingroup-outgroup feature of my design will allow the Fellow to also compute the perceiver, target, and self-enhancement effects specifically for one?s own ethnic in-group (e.g., Asians perceptions of other Asians) or an ethnic out-group.<br/>This research should provide a more complete and contextually nuanced understanding of how social perception and self-enhancement biases differ across Asian-Americans and other ethnic groups in the U.S. For example, this research importantly extends previous work by controlling for individual differences in both perceiver and target effects, thus beginning to resolve the inconsistent findings about self-enhancement for Asian and European Americans, as well as examining if there are personal or social consequences of this bias. Additionally, this research emphasizes the importance of the cultural context?conclusions about self-enhancement may critically depend on social comparison standards (e.g., comparing the self to an out-group or one?s ethnic in-group). In the future, the Fellow plans to conduct research that takes a cultural approach to studying social perception by examining how other factors such as ethnic identity strength, biculturalism, and acculturation shape self-perception processes. Specifically, she hopes to extend this work to other underrepresented populations including African Americans and Latinos.<br/>This proposal for postdoctoral training and research stems from earlier research that she conducted at UC-Berkeley, which has been funded initially by a NSF Pre-doctoral fellowship and a Ford Foundation Dissertation-Year fellowship. The Fellow looks forward to involving future generations of undergraduate and graduate students in research on minority and diversity issues and generating methodologically sound research on these topics. <br/>"

Understanding how available data can provide information about objects or events that cannot be directly experienced or manipulated is particularly challenging to students. Through ""Evidence-based inquiry into the distant, remote, or past (EIDRoP)"", Kansas State University (KSU) graduate fellows in the biological sciences, geosciences and physics will work with mentor teachers at Junction City High School (USD 475) to develop and teach both discipline-specific and interdisciplinary lessons responsive to state standards in science as inquiry and the nature of science. Professional development activities include a Summer Institute, a fellows class and an annual Capstone Meeting. Program goals are to: enhance young scientists' abilities as effective communicators and as educational collaborators; improve science education for grade 9-12 students through the infusion of contemporary science research, an integrated emphasis on nature of science, interdisciplinary teaching modules and provision of scientist role models; enhance the knowledge of grade 9-12 teachers through teacher training, interaction with KSU students and faculty, and curriculum enrichment; strengthen USD 475's partnerships with STEM departments at KSU; and expand collaborative partnerships within KSU and between KSU and K-12 education. EIDRoP will have extensive broader impacts in terms of enhancing education (of fellows, students, teachers and faculty), and will drive a cultural change in science education with respect to interactions between University science departments and K-12 education.<br/>"

They also have tremendous conservation value and support most remaining large native grazing animals in the world, particularly in Africa. A fundamental understanding of the factors most important for sustaining savanna grasslands, including their natural fire and grazing regimes, is required for their management and conservation. Scientists have questioned whether grasslands in different regions function similarly. Convergence in functioning would mean that ecological understanding and conservation strategies could be generalized for savanna grasslands worldwide. But contingent factors specific to a region, such as differences in evolutionary history or the types of grazers present, may lead to unique responses in some savanna grasslands. The goal of this research is to compare responses of key ecological processes to fire and grazing in North American and South African savanna grasslands. Scientists will take advantage of three ongoing, long-term experiments that manipulate fire return interval and the presence of large grazers. Responses of plant productivity, plant diversity and nutrient cycling will be compared, and the mechanisms underlying responses, such as differences in plant traits or evolutionary histories, will be assessed. <br/><br/>Comparative research elucidating the consequences of human alterations of fire and grazing regimes worldwide is needed to enable development of management strategies that can insure the sustainability of ecologically and economically important savanna grasslands. This research will provide the basic knowledge necessary to do so, as well as afford training and important global and cultural experiences for young scientists, graduate students and undergraduates. Finally, though collaborations that are already established, results will be made available to scientists and managers in South Africa."

REU site will bridge current and future Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students by offering exceptional research and training experiences for science students who intend to pursue careers in research or in secondary education. The production of research-literate teachers will subsequently improve the pipeline of future STEM students. This project includes research topics in several key scientific fields. Students will perform scientific research for a 10-week period, with regular progress reports to the cohort, giving multiple opportunities for discussion, constructive criticism, and support of their projects. Our participants will include undergraduates who plan to pursue graduate degrees and research careers, as well as those who plan to become science teachers. We will recruit from underrepresented groups and those without the opportunity to engage in research at their home institutions. We have taken advantage of several of Saint Mary?s strengths: a focus on academic excellence; strong teacher/student interactions; and Bay Area location with access to prominent science museums and research centers. The Bay Bridge REU is distinguished by the emphasis on science education and communication of science, and the inclusion of ethics workshops, in-depth field trips to science museums, and guided visits to technology companies and research institutes. This REU site aims to train future researchers, as well as the teachers of future scientists. The cohort made up of future researchers and teachers, the multidisciplinary research focus, and the diverse interactions inherent in the program will enrich the research experience.<br/>Intellectual Merit. The intellectual merit of this proposal stems from the unique combination of science research with science education, communication, and ethics. The key part of the program is to engage students in innovative research in different disciplines, reflecting the diversity of research interests and expertise at Saint Mary?s. All mentors have science Ph.D.s, active research projects, and extensive experience mentoring undergraduate researchers, including presentations and publications with undergraduate student co-authors. Saint Mary?s resources are sufficient to carry out the proposed projects and introduce students to advanced instrumentation and techniques. The Bay Bridge REU also contains education, communication, and ethics elements, through which students will communicate science at different levels, explore the connections between their research and science education, and identify and develop solutions for ethical issues.<br/>Broader Impacts. The Bay Bridge REU program involves research projects to advance scientific boundaries. Participants will contribute to science research and thereby enhance their undergraduate education. This research experience will improve the training of teachers in STEM disciplines, and these better-prepared teachers will provide a better educational experience for the next generation of STEM students. Each project will be submitted for publication, thus disseminating the results widely. The effectiveness of the unique combination of science research with science education, communication, and ethics activities will also be evaluated and the results disseminated."

This study is a beginning in addressing that gap. It is investigating whether access to cyber-infrastructure-based materials for teaching and learning in STEM results in more widespread and effective diffusion of resources than a traditional paper-based production and distribution. Using both a quasi-experimental design and network analysis, the project is testing a series of hypotheses that were generated from diffusion and network theory that are applicable across STEM disciplines.  Examples are whether user networks are homophilious, whether digitizing materials increases the scope density and rate of usage, and whether digitizing results in greater participation in the production of materials. This research has the potential to advance theoretical and practical insights into the means by which scientific resources for classroom use are diffused throughout networks of teachers and scholars in STEM fields. Research shows that introducing technological innovation does not ensure the diffusion of new ideas and that the diffusion of innovation occurs through social networks mediated by their density and the relative status of their members. <br/>The American Sociological Association (ASA) is creating the digital materials for this study.  ASA is launching a digital teaching resource center by moving more than 16,500 pages of teaching modules from a print-based delivery system into a web-based interactive digital science library. <br/>A key step of this project is the creation of a database of all 14,000 members of the ASA and their demographic, departmental, and institutional characteristics, their use of the paper-based science teaching materials, and the networks in which they participate (measured by the links such as graduate school cohorts, dissertation committees, and co-authors) among users, and the links among non-users. An updated database will be created in the second year in order to compare the characteristics of users and non-users, and their networks, of the paper resource materials and the digital library. In addition, the rate of adoption of individuals in denser or less dense networks will be assessed. <br/>As a membership organization ASA is able to establish a yearly database of both users and non-users of STEM teaching materials.  This membership database is a bounded network of association members that makes network analysis easier to conduct.  The availability of these data provides a set of unobtrusive measures that will avoid many of the costs and problems of other data collection methods. It is possible that the findings from this project will provide key insights about how to facilitate the movement of cutting-edge scientific findings into the classroom."

The Greenish warbler provides a rare example of 'speciation in action', providing the chance to observe the mechanisms underlying production of geographic variation within a species and divergence between geographically separated populations. In the last 10,000 years, the Greenish warbler has expanded its range northwards through Central Asia and into Siberia. The populations at the extremes of its range are recognized as two distinct species. However, the split is not complete, since these two species are connected by a chain of populations that continue to exchange genetic material. This project will investigate the process leading to divergence and speciation in the Greenish warbler, though examination of habitat, associated traits, including song and plumage color, and genetic relatedness, in three populations across the warbler's range. These data will be used to test alternative hypotheses of how selective pressures vary geographically and cause divergence between populations. <br/><br/>This project contributes to development of international collaborations and provides valuable biodiversity data from and conservation benefits to remote regions of Asia. In addition to providing training to the graduate student CoPI, the project provides involvement in scientific research to students within Russia and Kyrgyzstan and outreach to biologists in those countries through workshops developed by the CoPI.

The approach consists of fluorescent-magnetic nanomanipulators that impart force to the cell?s internal scaffolding (i.e., the cytoskeleton) through stimulation by custom-designed magnetic instrumentation. Cell response is observed via the nanomanipulators? fluorescence property. This research will focus on examining migration of cells crucial to the wound healing process (i.e., fibroblasts). Fluorescent-magnetic nanomanipulators will be characterized and optimized to interact with magnetic instrumentation; proof of concept of nanomanipulator delivery to the cell interior and manipulation potential will be demonstrated; and the effect of force applied by nanomanipulators on cell migration will be evaluated in fibroblasts. Deliverables include optimized nanomanipulators and magnetic instrumentation, validation of the intracellular force application method, documentation of research results in the fibroblast model, engineering student education at the graduate and undergraduate level, and a module based on this research for public school outreach disseminated by COSI, a local science museum.<br/><br/>If successful, this research will provide new tools to explore the influence of mechanical force on protein expression and cellular processes, in particular those that underlie cell migration. Cell migration is a critical component of several biological events including wound healing, fetal development, and cancer metastasis. This research would provide methods to apply force to subcellular components with the smallest manipulators yet studied (~ 10-50 nm), sizes that are similar to many of the components of interest (e.g., protein receptor, cytoskeletal element). Research results will be disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations, and also, to the general public, through interactions with an area science museum.

The structural disorder originates at the atomic scale from randomly packed atoms in proximity to each other. This disorder leads to some of the most remarkable mechanical properties that their crystalline counterparts can only envy: high strength close to the theoretical value, large elastic strain, and high toughness. Metallic glass covers a wide range of systems including transition metals, refractory metals, rare earth metals, and their alloys. These unique and superb properties make them the perfect candidates for many applications including structural components, durable and high performance equipment, coatings, and miniature devices subject to large loading, wear and corrosive protection, and precision shaping. In the past decade, extensive research and development have been done to utilize metallic glasses, especially their mechanical properties. This collaborative research is focused on probing atomic scale deformation processes and atomic structures. It combines experimental approaches using synchrotron X-ray scattering and neutron scattering, and atomistic simulations using molecular dynamics and first-principle calculations. Specifically, it addresses the following issues: (1) Atomic structures, including short- and medium-range order and their changes caused by deformation; (2) Mechanical responses and their differences for systems with different atomic structures; (3) Atomic scale characterizations of structure-mechanical responses such as free volume, local shear transformation, and local atomic bond changes that cannot be easily captured directly by experimental measurements.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this research is to establish the constitutive relations among stress, strain, strain rate, temperature and various physical, structural properties and compositional changes. Due to the difficulties posed by the structural disorder in metallic glasses, reliable constitutive relations must be built on detailed and accurate understanding of atomic scale processes and mechanisms. This effort contributes critically to the advancement of knowledge in this area. We also expect this effort to contribute a positive step in widening the applications of this marvelous material, thus gaining an edge for US industries in the highly competitive world market. Another integral part of this proposed work is the education and outreach program. The project follows two tracks in this regard: (1) participation in outreach education program for local minority engineering undergraduates and K-12 program for students interested in engineering careers through demonstrations, workshops, and hands-on learning experiences, (2) establishment of a close collaboration and exchange program between experimental and computational work for graduate students in Georgia Tech and University of Tennessee, contributing to a rich education experience for both undergraduates and graduate students."

Backstresses or LRIS in the past have been suggested by many (but certainly not all) to exist in plastically deformed crystalline materials. Elevated stresses can be present in regions of elevated dislocation density or dislocation heterogeneities in the deformed microstructures. The heterogeneities include edge dislocation dipole bundles (veins) and the edge dipole walls of persistent slip bands (PSBs) in cyclically deformed materials and cell and subgrain walls in monotonically deformed materials. The existence of long-range internal stress is especially important for the understanding of cyclic deformation and also monotonic de-formation. Preliminary x-ray microbeam diffraction experiments that are able to deter-mine the elastic strains within the cell interiors were performed by the principal investi-gator using a synchrotron. These were accomplished using, oriented, monotonically and cyclically (presaturation, i.e., no PSBs) deformed Cu single crystals. The results suggest that small (17 to 29 % of the applied stress) long-range internal stresses may be present in cell interiors. These LRIS vary substantially from cell to cell as 0-50% the applied stress. This proposal includes an attempt to measure elastic strains in the cell walls which has been challenging due to the high defect density. This will help complete the definitive analysis of LRIS in deformed materials. Finally, detailed transmission electron micros-copy will be performed on the dislocation substructure (Burger?s vector analysis and pre-cise spatial positioning of wall dislocations), to assess through a dislocation dynamics code, a verification of the experimental LRIS. The understanding of plastic deformation, in general, is expected to be enhanced. We expect to be the first to definitively assess long-range internal stresses in plastically deformed materials.  <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This is a project to uncover the secrets of the strength of materials using x-ray mi-crobeams. The use of intense, submicron, x-ray beams at the Advanced Photon Source in Illinois has led to the discovery that structural materials are under significant, variable internal stresses of opposite direction on submicron length scales corresponding to the dislocation substructure. This result has profound implications for understanding the me-chanical strength and behavior of materials. The presence of counterbalanced stresses within microscopic volumes (or cells) in deformed materials was predicted more than two decades ago and has been inferred from numerous indirect experiments. Yet, direct proof of their existence has been elusive, as spatially-resolved measurements of the stress mag-nitudes and distributions critical for testing theories and computer modeling were not possible before the development of high-resolution x-ray microbeams at synchrotron sources. The implications of this work are of direct relevance to important practical prob-lems such as sheet metal forming (for example, in automobile production) and metal fa-tigue, the latter being responsible for most structural materials failures.<br/>"

The problems considered may be viewed as far-reaching extensions of classical results. At the same time, these problems lead to strong applications of ergodic theory to combinatorics, number theory, and algebra that are inaccessible, so far, by conventional methods. Some of the polynomial results obtained by the principal investigators in recent years have served as an impetus for further developments in the theory of multiple recurrence. These developments provide better understanding of the phenomenon of multiple recurrence along polynomials and bring new vistas of research to light. Some of these avenues of research lead to interesting new connections with and applications to the theory of prime numbers and finitary combinatorics. An interesting and important direction of research opened up by the results of the principal investigators is connected to the entrance of nilpotent groups into the picture. Not only are most of the familiar results dealing with commutative groups naturally extendible to the nilpotent setting, but it also turns out that nilpotent dynamics allow one to get new information about convergence and recurrence properties of abelian groups of measure-preserving transformations. The related conjectures that underlie the project shed new light on the linkages between nilpotent dynamics and important problems in ergodic theory, combinatorics, and uniform distribution.<br/><br/>The problems and conjectures that are under investigation in this project connect diverse areas of mathematics (ergodic theory, combinatorics, algebra, number theory) and contribute to each. For example, in recent years the methods, results, and ideas originating in the theory of ""multiple recurrence"" (some of which are due to principal investigators) have engendered spectacular advances in the study of prime numbers. Another interesting direction of research that has emerged recently links ergodic theory of multiple recurrence with combinatorics in the algebraic area of ""finite fields."" These developments have connections with theoretical computer science. The goal of this project is to obtain a better understanding of the regularity of the behavior of dynamical systems sampled at moments of time corresponding to values of polynomial (and more general) functions. While the project focuses on applications of this phenomenon in the mathematical areas of combinatorics and number theory, it may be of interest to physicists as well. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the area of so-called ergodic Ramsey theory, with its diversity of problems, techniques, and applications, is an excellent medium for attracting undergraduates to mathematics and graduate students to an area of active research."

The Coe Group has developed a new method for recording ""scatter-free"" infrared (IR) absorption spectra of individual microparticles in the 1-5 micrometer size regime, using a standard FTIR imaging microspectrometer by placing a microparticle in a hole of plasmonic metal mesh.  Particles of this size are important to human health because they get past our noses and throats and are efficiently trapped in our lungs - in fact death rates are known to rise with increases in airborne particulate matter.  The group will employ this new method to analyze the chemical content of airborne dust particles, which may be important in identifying or quantifying respiratory health risks.  These new techniques will also be applied to individual yeast cells which are smaller than most of the infrared wavelength range and subject to large scattering effects.  Success would be broadly applicable in the biological sciences.  Finally, in addition to the training of graduate students in the new field of plasmonics for chemistry, Prof. Coe and his students will enable the remote use of a cyber-enabled imaging Raman microspectrometer by students from Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama and California State University Dominguez Hills (CSUDH) in Carson,California."

Translation is the process by which genetic information is transferred from a nucleic acid sequence into the amino acid sequence of a protein. The fidelity of translation is determined at two major points: the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA selection by the ribosomes and synthesis of cognate amino acid/tRNA pairs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) in the course of the aminoacylation reaction. The aaRSs define the genetic code by pairing tRNAs with the corresponding amino acids. Accurate aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis often requires an additional editing activity intrinsic to many aaRSs. Editing significantly decreases the frequency of mistakes during aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis in vitro, although many details of the reaction mechanism and the impact of editing on the living cell remain unclear. The goals of this project are to use phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) as a model system to clarify the molecular mechanisms of editing, and to investigate the physiological role of editing in the cell. The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity will be to provide integrated laboratory research and training programs for both undergraduate and graduate students including members of historically underrepresented minorities, and to provide laboratory training and education experiences for middle and high school teachers and their students."

These are rather canonical very large families of correlated random variables with a smooth ``high-dimensional"" correlation structure, which are very different from the structures investigated by classical probability theory.  The physicists predict the emergence   under very general conditions of a kind of self-organization called ultrametricity. We suspect that the root of this phenomenon lies in a family of probabilistic identities discovered a few years ago by Ghirlanda and Guerra and we plan to investigate whether  this is really the case.  A somewhat different direction of the proposal plans to focus on the general theory of stochastic processes. There are indications that some new structure theorems are possible, that would in some precise sense affirm that if  certain types of stochastic processes are well-behaved according to their sample boundedness properties, then there is simple ``witness'' of their good behavior. This would imply that when trying to decide whether a specific stochastic process has a good behavior, this can be done only by finding the appropriate witness and by no other means. Both part of the proposal represent a genuinely new direction of Probability theory. <br/><br/>A growing number of large scale operations (safety of electrical networks, safety of nuclear plants, finance) essentially depend on tools from Probability theory. This proposal investigates two new directions in this theory. The first concerns the emergence in certain large random structures of remarkable kind of self-organization discovered by theoretical physicists. The second attempts to prove that there is a kind of universal method to control how large can be the ``worst occurrence'' of certain random quantities, and that therefore it is useless to attempt to do this in any other way than as prescribed by the universal method."

As ""propaganda by deed,"" terrorism is essentially a form of psychological warfare, and is therefore heavily reliant on the modern mass media to convey its symbolic messages.  Unfortunately, little comparative or cross-national research has explored the nexus between terrorism, the mass media, and democracy, and what exists has suffered from theoretical anemia, definitional ambiguities over the different types of political violence, and concerns about how data on political violence are collected.<br/><br/>This project introduces innovations to help correct these problems. Specifically, nesting social movements and diffusion theories within a social ecology framework, we draw hypotheses concerning the media's role in various forms of political violence. At the same time, we introduce a refined typology of political violence as well as new media variables to partially correct some of the problems plaguing current research.  In terms of methodology, we will use pooled time-series analysis on the ITERATE database as well as other data sources that provide appropriate information for most of the world?s nations.  Some preliminary results using ITERATE suggest that 1) net of media effects, democracy has very little influence on political violence; 2) democracy interacts with the presence of the Western press to encourage transnational terrorism; but 3) this is not the case when violent actors target government (i.e., guerilla war). <br/><br/>This research will contribute to our understanding of political violence in three ways.  First, it will provide a new theoretical framework for understanding political violence that suggests fresher, more nuanced hypotheses (e.g., the mass media should encourage terrorism but discourage ongoing guerilla/civil/international warfare).  Second, it will demonstrate how refined definitions of various forms of political violence (such as strictly defining ?terrorism? as attacks on civilians) can have a major impact on research findings.  Third, as most data on political violence are taken from media accounts, there is a natural (or artifactual) correlation between media reportage and political violence.  To correct this, the project introduces a relatively simple technique for disentangling media artifacts from the true influence of media on political violence.     <br/><br/>While many scholars and policy-makers suspect that the mass media and democratization are central to the staging of terrorism and other forms of violence, there is no agreement on their distinctive or combined effects. The research innovations introduced by this project will improve on past research and, as these relationships become clearer, finally answer questions about how democracy and the mass media invite or discourage political violence, moving us beyond heated debate.  More broadly, Shakespeare has proven prescient when he said that ""all the world's a stage.""  The modern mass media have made it so, but the influence of media on other sociological, political and economic phenomena is not well-understood.  This project will demonstrate at least one way to study media effects on a global scale, and the framework can accommodate the investigation of many other media-driven phenomena such as global business cycles, waves of democratization, transnational protest/mobilization, the spread (and occasional contraction) of so-called ""world polity"", and many other forms of transnational social change."

This morphology decouples absorption depth from diffusion length, allowing effective exciton diffusion to large interfacial areas as well as vertical charge transport with reduced recombination. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The proposed nanoimprint lithography with innovative mold technologies provides a practical means with greater precision than currently available techniques to make an optimal solar cell design. The thermal imprinting process can also induce favorable polymer chain alignment and crystallization, leading to higher hole mobility and light absorption. By decoupling absorption depth from diffusion length, a thicker polymer film than in conventional bulk heterojunction devices can be used to enhance light adsorption considerably. This morphology provides a basic nano-platform to study the interrelated polymer properties (crystallinity, mobility, chain orientation, stability, thermal dynamic properties, etc) and their correlation with geometry, imprint temperature, surface effects, and device quantum efficiency. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: This study will establish a comprehensive understanding of the effects of heterojunction nano-morphology on material properties and device characteristics, which is transformative to other materials and devices. What may naturally follow is the demonstration of 7-12% PCE in polymer solar cells. This research will be integrated with education through available programs at UTD to provide research opportunities for students. Particularly, this program aims to bring greater nanotechnology exposure to a broad range of individuals including undergraduates and the education community on the whole. <br/>"

Many of these are central to multi-billion dollar U.S. industries, such as flat-panel TV?s and computer monitors. The atomic-scale structure of these materials controls their properties, which must be tailored to improve performance in their diverse uses. This project seeks to understand general principles of  how variations in the glass composition, and the way that it is heat-treated during manufacturing, change the glass structure in useful ways, to allow properties to be more easily predicted and engineered. The results of these studies should have more general interest as well, in other fields of science where glasses (and the liquids that form glass on cooling) are important, including geosciences and condensed-matter physics. Education is central to this project, since most of the research will be part of the training of Ph.D. and undergraduate students on their ways to careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS<br/>The most important experimental approach that will be used is solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which provides quantitative details about the structure around many of the components common in technological glasses, including boron, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen. The P.I. and students in this program will synthesize several series of glasses with systematic variations in composition, and measure how glass structure changes. They will vary the thermal history of the glasses to look for clearly important, but poorly-known, effects of temperature. They will analyze results with thermodynamic modeling to allow prediction of critical properties. Much of the current development of improved and new types of glass materials comes from trial-and-error experimentation; it is thus an important goal to develop more fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships. Success with this goal could lead to new ways of thinking about designing glass compositions for new applications. Given major efforts in fundamental glass science in other countries, and the importance of the manufacturing of high-tech glasses in U.S. industry, it seems particularly urgent to progress in more basic understanding of these materials.<br/>"

The work brings together an engineer, an educational psychologist and a pedagogical design expert in the design and development a universal Internet-based remote laboratory environment where students can proceed at their own pace with more flexibility. The customizable environment brings together an embedded assessment and monitoring facility (progress of a student and the class as a whole) to a range of laboratory courses, so that faculty/facilitator from STEM disciplines can integrate their laboratory courses with very little effort. Students experience engaging laboratories and a means for developing skills of self-monitoring and reflection, while working from pre-existing knowledge of each student. The concept blends emerging Internet technology, software, computer interfacing, cutting edge graphical user interface, effective pedagogical designs, assessment and evaluation schemes. The developed environment has five important features: a) learning through remote laboratory; b) ease of integration with a range of STEM courses; c) real-time video and audio link with experiments; d) frequent student feedback; and e) faculty/facilitator monitoring of student progress and activities. The remote laboratory entails physical (real) laboratory equipment that is controlled<br/>remotely. The developed environment is validated by using two undergraduate<br/>level laboratory courses (advanced digital design laboratory and control systems laboratory). Advances in cross discipline integration and inquiry into unique challenges posed by an unpredictable arena of human learning are combined with emerging technologies to achieve the highest possible performance in learning. The activities build on knowledge developed during a previous NSF grant and advance this remote laboratory to the next level by making it flexible and more effective for utilization in range of STEM subject areas. The project is potentially transformative because it is converting traditional production-line style laboratory delivery systems to a personalized and individualized approach to learning."

This rapid glacial recession has important implications for coastal watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry because the loss of glacier ice decreases hydrologic storage and dramatically alters catchment landcover by exposing new land to the process of primary succession. The ecological development of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems following deglaciation has been explored extensively, however there has been very little research on how landcover change will alter material delivery into and through the river network to coastal estuaries.  This project will fill this critical knowledge gap by evaluating how glacial recession is altering hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in coastal watersheds in southeastern Alaska.  In particular, our research will develop a comprehensive understanding of how the speciation, fate and transport of riverine nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) will be altered by ongoing glacial retreat.  Weekly and storm sampling combined with continuous discharge measurements will provide the first detailed and complete comparison of nutrient and DOM yields between paired glacial and non-glacial watersheds. Continuous measurements of discharge, oxygen, temperature and turbidity will be used to quantify the effects of glacial meltwater on hydrologic and physical parameters. Experimental approaches (laboratory and field-scale) combined with longitudinal surveys and stream tracers will be used to elucidate the fate of nutrients and DOM during downstream transport. Finally, longitudinal synoptics and source sampling will also be used to access the primary landscape sources of nutrients and carbon to the stream. Ultimately, project findings will provide new insights into how land-to-ocean fluxes of organic and inorganic nutrients are being altered by glacial recession along the GOA and in other glaciated coastal regions.<br/>The project will provide laboratory and field research opportunities for undergraduates at the University of Alaska Southeast (UAS), a small, undergraduate university with a high (16%) enrollment of native Alaskan students.  Additionally, the project will provide training for one graduate student and one post-doctoral researcher.  The integration of undergraduate students in this research project will provide a framework for students and researchers to cooperatively investigate important linkages among climate, landcover change, and hydrological and biogeochemical processes in coastal watersheds.  In addition, the project will strengthen an existing partnership between scientists at UAS and naturalists at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center who will work collaboratively to incorporate project results into an interpretive display at the center.  The Mendenhall Glacier is the most visited glacier in the United States and hosts over 300,000 visitors each year and thus provides a unique and effective opportunity for public outreach and education related to the findings of this project.

Thus, understanding the roots and mechanisms of their morphological, functional, and ecological diversification will provide a critical link in the reconstruction of vertebrate evolutionary history. This symposium, which will be held at the annual Joint Meeting of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (July 22-27, 2009), will promote an integration of ideas and techniques across multiple disciplines and levels of biological organization, all within the context of the functional morphology of cartilaginous fishes.

A novel aspect of this symposium is that pairs of participants will develop ""state of the field"" presentations, and it is anticipated that the integration of numerous functional systems in one symposium will foster an understanding of the parameters unique or common to each system. As the nature of the symposium is synergistic, the event will undoubtedly promote future collaborations as well. Additionally, the symposium will facilitate a transfer of technology and techniques among the speakers and audience through a half-day workshop featuring industry-leading producers of technology used in functional morphology research."

The area burned is large enough (>1000 km2) that its impacts can be measured directly at multiple scales, from small plots, to small (first-order) catchments and hillslopes, to large (third-order) catchments, to the atmospheric boundary layer above the entire burn. As the burned area recovers over time, observations of changes in key ecosystem processes and in terrestrial and aquatic communities will afford insights into controls and interactions among system components that would not be possible from long-term observation of an undisturbed or unmanipulated tundra landscape. The AR fire also serves as a harbinger of future change in the arctic landscape and its interactions with the atmosphere, aquatic systems, and oceans as global climate continues to warm. It provides a standard of comparison with predictions of long-term response to disturbance and climate change, based on finer-scale, shorter-term experimental studies. Finally, because the area burned is so large, it provides an opportunity for measuring change at a scale that is directly relevant to large-area, PanArctic modeling and prediction.

Over the last decades, studies of complex oxides have uncovered rich behavior that allows for interesting properties but presents great difficulties in understanding the basic controlling physics. An emerging picture in the study of these materials is the ubiquitous presence of inhomogeneity at several different length scales. There are several important experimental degrees of freedom that can be exploited in the study of films: strain, epitaxy, finite size effects, and the creation of artificial multilayer lattices. We will use these parameters to better understand the interplay between magnetism, charge ordering, and electronic phase separation. This work will require significant development of our ability to control the oxygen content in oxide films and to measure the oxygen that has been incorporated. It will build the infrastructure for oxide film studies at the University of Connecticut, further collaborations with NIST and Brookhaven National Laboratory, and help train both students and Connecticut area high school science teachers. <br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This project will take advantage of the considerable technology that has been developed recently to control properties of nanoscale films of functional oxide materials in order to better understand the fundamental physics of these materials. Functional oxide materials have surprising and extremely useful properties, but they are not well understood at a basic level. Films the thickness of a few nanometers can be different from the same material in bulk form for many reasons including a change in the typical atom to atom distances, the extreme thinness of the film can induce effects from quantum mechanics, and new properties can arise by layering films of different compounds on top of each other. Each of these effects can serve as a control parameter to test basic theories. This work will require significant development of the ability to control and measure the amount of oxygen in the films. It will build the infrastructure for nanoscale film studies at the University of Connecticut, further collaborations with NIST and Brookhaven National Laboratory, and help train students. At least one high school science teacher will work with the group each summer to further her/his scientific training and then be able to bring the research frontier back into the classroom. <br/>"

The need for students to think spatially and use geospatial technologies is becoming more critical as these tools and concepts are increasingly incorporated into a broad range of occupations and academic disciplines. Geo-STAC addresses important needs to improve geospatial education and community college program recruitment by creating a pathway between the community college and high school teachers and their students. Geo-STAC is providing professional development workshops for high school teachers representing STEM and non-STEM disciplines to help teachers: (1) understand the importance of geospatial thinking; (2) learn how to use geospatial thinking in their particular discipline; (3) learn about geospatial technologies; (4) develop a Web-based GIS lesson; and (5) implement a Web-based GIS lesson. Geo-STAC also is working directly with high school students so that they: (1) understand the importance of geospatial technologies and careers in future job markets; (2) learn how to use Web-based GIS to solve problems; and (3) visit the community college GIS lab and experience using desktop GIS. The Geo-STAC project is strongly supported by the new National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence (GeoTech Center), the Lane County Education Service District (Lane ESD), high school teachers, and several community colleges across the country. Geo-STAC is actively disseminating this collaborative model to community colleges across the country."

This activity will engage researchers and educators in the refinement and validation of system requirements. The project includes the development of a detailed science case, concept of operations, design, and implementation plan for the eXtreme Digital (XD) Integrating Services.  The primary goal of the next phase of the TeraGrid, XD, is to enable major advances in science and engineering research, in the integration of research and education, and in broadening participation in science and engineering by under-represented groups, by providing researchers and educators with usable access to extreme-scale digital resources, beyond those typically available on a typical campus, together with the interfaces, consulting support and training necessary to facilitate their use.  The target for XD is innovation in the design and implementation of an effective, efficient, increasingly virtualized approach to the provision of high-end digital services ? extreme digital services - for researchers and educators.  The XD infrastructure is intended to integrate extreme-scale digital resources and services into a common framework that makes it easy for researchers to take advantage of multiple resources and services, including the ability to move between using local resources and national resources within a single, well integrated environment.   <br/><br/>The proposed activity is a planning activity for a project that, if successful, will provide infrastructure for research and education across a broad range of areas in science and engineering.  In addition to users who are career researchers, it can reasonably be expected that this infrastructure will be used by several hundred graduate students and post-doctoral researchers each year as part of their research.

The simulations will be used to determine fundamental parameters of the Standard Model of nuclear physics and will help to determine its range of validity.  They will also be used to calculate the masses, internal structure and interactions of strongly interacting particles, including the masses of the up and down quarks and the values of the weak transition couplings between quarks. These are parameters in the Lagrangian that defines the Standard Model and refinement of these parameters will allow the prediction of rare decays under the Standard Model.  The nature of the predictions of such decays can be quantitatively compared with the signatures of such decays in high-energy physics experiments.  Physicists plan to use such comparisons to determine the range of validity of the Standard Model.  The combination of lattice-gauge calculations such as these and experiments in facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider offer a way of probing for new physics in the behavior of sub-atomic particles.  The proposed simulations will reduce the uncertainty in the masses of the light and heavy quarks to 1% and contribute to a number of other questions in nuclear physics.<br/><br/>The project will provide a library of gauge configurations that will be made available as a resource that will support research by many nuclear physicists, domestically and internationally.

Traditional tools to support VOs (e.g., electronic mail) enable communication and coordination at a distance and across institutional barriers. In such cases, the organizational work of forming and sustaining VOs focuses on the use of these tools to foster trust and to negotiate equitable and efficient resource utilization. More recently, research in computer science has sought to delegate such organizational work to a new class of VO tools, collectively termed ?Grid? technologies.  Grid technologies are envisioned to provide new modes of collaboration, improved allocation of scarce resources, and novel pathways for discovery and innovation. While past research has successfully addressed questions of long-distance communication and coordination involving traditional tools, much less is known about how new tools may transform VOs. Open questions include: the consequences of delegating trust, access and resource distribution to Grid-based systems; the challenges of sustaining computationally-supported VOs; and the new kinds of organizational roles and responsibilities necessary for the upkeep and maintenance of VOs.  <br/><br/>This project undertakes a comparative study of VO formation and maintenance in two leading collaborative science networks: the Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).  Both LTER and OSG are mature enterprises for supporting multidisciplinary scientific research; however, they differ in the nature of their VO tool use.  Whereas LTER uses a broad variety of conventional tools to augment organizational communication (exhibiting the communicational paradigm, or a 'weakly technically delegated' VO), OSG delegates key components of organizational life and maintenance to Grid-based mechanisms (i.e., a ?strongly technically delegated VO, exemplifying the computational paradigm). Using ethnographic and comparative methods, and drawing on theories from science and technology studies (STS), organization science, and human-computer interaction, this study will compare the different approaches taken by LTER and OSG to: i) provide a better and more sophisticated mapping of the characteristics of individuals, groups and organizations that embrace VOs; and ii) develop rigorous comparative models for the differential human and technical work which sustain VOs.<br/><br/>"

The narrow and cylindrical surfaces, inclines and gaps between branches in complex three-dimensional arboreal environments pose several demands well suited for determining: the limits and tradeoffs for musculoskeletal performance, proximate factors influencing gait selection, and the role of sensory information for modifying motor output and choosing different routes in complex environments.  The study species have considerable variation in musculoskeletal anatomy that is universally important for function including: the ratio of tendon to contractile tissue length within muscles, the cross-sectional areas of muscle, total body length to weight, and the numbers and mobility of skeletal joints.  This anatomical variation likely reflect tradeoffs between being flexible vs. stiff, strong vs. weak, and heavy vs. light, all of which are generally important as well as specifically relevant for snakes performing the different ecologically relevant tasks of actively bending to conform and grip cylindrical surfaces vs. supporting a body draped loosely over widely spaced branches.  One study species is the brown tree snake, which causes costly power outages in Guam, but determining the surfaces that are impassable for this species and obtaining information on route choice and gap-bridging should facilitate managing this destructive invasive species.

Biofiltration systems have recently emerged as an attractive option for controlling volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions from industrial processes due to its cost effectiveness. However, a number of challenges face biofiltration technology. Typically, most off-gas or treatment streams for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that originate in industrial processes have variable flowrates and contaminant compositions that limit the handling efficiency of the biofiltration system. Furthermore, hydrophobic contaminants are not readily bio-available. Nevertheless, the regulatory community generally expects emission controls to be capable of maintaining adequate treatment. <br/><br/>As a solution to this limitation in biofiltration systems, a novel integrated technology will be investigated to achieve stable contaminant removal efficiency by combining the buffering capacity of a two bed cyclic adsorption/desorption unit with a Trickle Bed Air Biofilter (TBAB). The bioavailability of hydrophobic compounds will be enhanced by the introduction of non-toxic surfactants that will serve dual purposes, increasing solubility and limiting excess biomass growth. The primary objective of this project will be to establish the effectiveness of coupling adsorption with biofiltration to yield an efficient treatment train that can comply with emissions regulation during adverse conditions of industrial operation especially for recalcitrant low solubility contaminants. The results of the study are expected to form the scientific and engineering bases for an innovative integrated treatment scheme for effective control of hydrophobic VOCs under varying loading conditions. It is expected that the utilization of the 2- bed cyclic adsorption/desorption unit to minimize fluctuations in the TBAB operation will improve the overall efficiency of the biofiltration treatment process; provide cost savings and more consistent emission compliance. <br/><br/>As a general class of additional benefits, the proposed scheme for removal of hydrophobic VOCs is expected to promote significantly improved air emission control technologies. Furthermore, the research activities will emphasize learning through discovery and can be used to establish a culture of curiosity, critical thinking, and an authentic scientific method of inquiry for both undergraduate and graduate students. The 7th to 12th grade teachers involved in the RET site project (in which the PI of this project is a CO-PI) will have the opportunity to gain knowledge in the proposed research through scheduled Engineering Seminars and poster forums and convey the knowledge gained in their teachings of math and science. Furthermore, the results obtained in this study will be disseminated by presentations at national and international conferences and by publication in peer refereed journals for enhancing scientific and technological understanding of the proposed integrated technology."

One major deficiency in the advancement of biofuels is the need to do more integrated and cross-disciplinary research. This conference brings together a broad spectrum of core experts to bridge this gap and help to better enable and advance biofuel research efforts globally. The specific objectives of Keystone Symposia's The Future of Biofuels meeting (organized by Drs. William D. Provine, Chris R. Somerville, Doug Cameron and Jay D. Keasling) are as follows:<br/>1. Address critical barriers to progress in biofuel technology development and innovation,<br/>2. Forge interdisciplinary understanding and collaboration among scientists working in this field,<br/>3. Compare competing ideas, approaches, and strategies in order to address regional challenges for biofuel choices and applications, and<br/>4. Provide an interactive forum to involve new investigators and highlight their discoveries.<br/><br/>Intellectual merits: The Future of Biofuels meeting aims to advance knowledge and understanding within the field of biofuels research by presenting a more scientific view of the leading edge of knowledge in this area. In contrast, most meetings in the field of biofuels are industry meetings in which companies outline their goals and technologies. Keystone Symposia provides an internationally recognized platform as well as resources to ensure the success of this meeting and the organizers are well-recognized leaders in the field of biofuels research.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The field of biofuels is very dynamic and complex. There are many parallel ideas converging on the core issues in the field, and a large number of disciplines, ranging from social sciences and economics to chemical engineering and agronomy. There is a need to bring these disciplines together in a common format to facilitate interdisciplinary contacts and collaborations. Keystone Symposia's The Future of Biofuels meeting will provide a venue in which the various kinds of approaches can be critically considered within one intellectual framework. Additionally, this meeting will enhance infrastructure by fostering networking and initiation of collaborations. We anticipate the following educational benefits: acquaint trainees and investigators new to field with the state-of-the-art; critical scientific feedback; and career development for trainees and new investigators, including opportunities both to see successful scientists presenting cutting-edge science and to network with prospective mentors and others who might contribute to their scientific and professional development.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Energy for Sustainability, Catalysis and Biocatalysis and Environmental Sustainability programs of the CBET Division of the Engineering Directorate."

Study of 2-D phase transitions on flat and curved surfaces, and use of the 2-D phase transitions associated with these novel homopolymer-nanoparticle hybrides to control the stability, morphology and transitional pathways of micelles are parts of this project.  Using lamellar crystals of specifically designed and synthesized particles-crystallizable homo- and copolymers grown in dilute solution, the proposed research will create a flat substrate with particles closely tethered to the surface using these ?sandwiched? single crystals. With near monodispersed molecular weight, the tethered particle will possess a uniform and controllable volume fraction on the surface. Monitoring the lamellar crystal thickness changes at different crystallization temperatures will enable a quantitative investigation of theoretically and technologically important 2-D phase transitions. Lamellar single crystals of hybride linear diblock copolymers, where the two immiscible, non-crystallizable ends will be located at opposite basal surfaces of the single crystal, will be grown.  The newly developed method to create the tethered particle substrates using particle-crystallizable polymers would provide precisely controlled systems that will give significant insight into low dimensional phase transitions which will be an important contribution to the previously developed theories. In addition, combining knowledge from both particle and polymer physics would enable the development of materials with accurately controlled particle interfacial volume fractions, block molecular weights, block chemistries, and molecular architectures.<br/><br/>The project is expected to enhance the knowledge base in developing additional understanding of soft materials physics in general and their behavior in crystals, on surfaces and on micelles.  The proposed research would be exposing graduate and undergraduate student to topics in advanced soft materials while promoting an interdisciplinary approach to research.  Recruiting and training of gifted and underrepresented high school students through ""Upward Bound Math/Science"" and ""Summer Honors Institute for Gifted High School Students"" programs are also planned as part  of this project.<br/><br/>"

While the major sources of this N, atmospheric deposition, wastewater, fertilizer, and other agricultural sources are well known, their relative importance as N sources to particular estuaries is not. One trouble is that the deposition monitoring network used by most researchers in the US was designed to avoid influences from nearby sources such as suburban/urban areas. This is significant because a major source of emissions especially in urban areas are mobile sources such as motor vehicles and construction equipment and a portion of their emissions are deposited nearby. This work will allow more accurate estimates of nitrogen fluxes from urban catchments by including deposition from mobile source emissions. As part of this research, N budgets will be constructed for sub-watersheds along a land-use gradient from the urban core to the rural/suburban fringe of Baltimore that take into account the contribution of mobile sources to atmospheric N inputs. As part of this research, students will be involved in collecting samples from collectors placed throughout the study area at schools associated with the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Schoolyard LTER. <br/><br/>Results of this study will have implications for the management of coastal systems' especially those near major metropolitan areas. This proposal is an important first step in quantifying the contribution of a significant and previously overlooked source of N to our coastal systems. Because of this gap in our understanding it is difficult to design an integrated plan to manage N inputs to estuaries. This is the first project to consider mobile source deposition in watershed N budgets and to relate these estimates to the two methods widely used by researchers and managers to estimate deposition (NADP/CASTNet) and emissions (EPA's National Mobile Inventory Model)."

A challenge faced by the Smart Structures community is the fact that structures vary in different geographical regions due to local building practices, availability of materials and dynamic loads likely to be experienced in the region. Ideal Smart Structure solutions should be universal in order to achieve the desired performance for various structures in the environment. <br/><br/>Reducing structural damage due to natural and made-made hazards in is vital to the safety and economic viability of society. Smart Structures which are those structures that can sense their environment and react accordingly, can provide more resilient designs, more effective construction, and extend overall the safe life of our built infrastructure. This collaborative project will further advance research on universal solutions in Smart Structures. <br/><br/>This program will engage six undergraduate students over ten weeks in these research activities: 1) formal training in structural dynamics, health monitoring and control; 2) experience conducting laboratory experiments in Smart Structures; 3) travel to KAIST in South Korea to experience international collaboration and gain access to world class facilities in Smart Structures; and 4) participate in site visits and cultural events. <br/><br/>The PIs will focus recruitment efforts on students from underrepresented groups at minority institutions. Undergraduate students will work directly with U.S. and Korean graduate students gaining valuable insight about research and graduate school. <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

We will target sophomore to junior-level undergraduate geoscience and pre-service teacher participants from urban comprehensive universities in the Great Lakes and mid-continent region. Our regional recruitment will allow us to encourage students of color from urban areas to participate as well as facilitating participants to present their research at a common North-Central section meeting of the Geological Society of America. We anticipate that this REU experience will positively influence participants to complete a baccalaureate degree and pursue graduate work.<br/><br/>Understanding the dynamics of human-climate interaction remains one of society's looming unanswered questions. The role of natural climate variability and how it may differ from how humans may have changed their environment and driven localized changes to climate is a leading area of global change research. Our faculty will mentor students in the collection, analyses, and interpretation of data from the modern subtropical lake systems and past records of environmental change from sedimentary cores recovered from lakes in the Bahamas. These data will be compared to stratigraphic, biological, and chemical records derived from archaeologically excavations in order to decipher the footprint of human occupation and how it may have impacted the physical and biological environments. These data will be used to build a deeper understanding of the history and nature of climatic and anthropogenic environmental change through time.<br/><br/>The Bahamian Lakes REU site has the potential of increasing both the number of women and under-represented minorities completing gesoscience undergraduate degrees and continuing on to graduate programs. We believe that our international collaboration with the College of the Bahamas and the Bahamian Antiquities, Monuments, and Museums Corporation and the international nature of the fieldwork will provide an unparalleled avenue for cultural enrichment for the students as well as an experience in global cooperation that will be invaluable for a student's future success in an increasingly global workforce and economy.<br/><br/>This award is funded by the Division of Earth Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering."

To reconcile the classical and free central limit theorems, he will study a noncommutative central limit theorem that was suggested by examples in his previous work. He will study similarities between the exponential families of statistics and the Cauchy-Stieltjes kernel families as a way to relate the normal, binomial, gamma and Poisson laws to their counterparts in free probability. He will investigate matrix ensembles that share similarities with such laws, and may lead to new matrix models for the corresponding free probability laws. The PI will use the orthogonality measures of the Askey-Wilson polynomials as a replacement for the above mentioned classical laws to construct Markov processes with linear regressions and quadratic conditional variances on an interval.<br/>He will also analyze large deviations of Markov chains that describe the behavior of geometric quantities like the number of vertexes of prescribed degree as they vary during the evolution of a random tree.<br/><br/>This research originated from the study of random processes that have linear regressions and quadratic conditional variances. These processes model phenomena that evolve at random when the initial and final endpoints are given by following a straight line on average. The randomness occurs as deviations from that line with variance that is a quadratic function of the endpoints.  Such processes, not surprisingly, turn out to be Markov; but surprisingly they exhibit intimate connections to noncommutative probability, and in particular to free probability that usually arises as approximation to spectra of large random matrices. Thus the PI will also investigate random matrices, quadratic regression problems, and the centrial limit theorem in a noncommutative setting.  A separate topic to be investigated are rare phenomena arising in random tree models that evolve in time.  Random trees serve as models in biology, psychology, and computer science.<br/>Rare events of interest consist of unusually large deviations from the equilibrium, and they model a rare but influential behavior of the system."

She will work on Slow Slip Events (SSEs) and Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) observed on Cascadia subduction zone.  These events, observed in subduction zones worldwide, slowly release significant stress throughout the earthquake cycle in a matter of days to weeks.  In contrast, earthquakes release stress in a matter of seconds to minutes.   How SSE and ETS events redistribute stresses and contribute to large earthquakes in subduction zones is largely unknown.  Recent advances in GPS and seismic networks have led to many interesting observations regarding SSE and ETS events.  For example, SSE and ETS events in Cascadia have variable recurrence times along the coastline that spans from the Mendocino Triple Junction to north of Vancouver Island.  Another interesting characteristic of ETS events is its sensitivity to lunar tides. This study will investigate these two observations: variable recurrence time along the coast and effects of lunar tides. This research will use existing geodetic and seismic data sets combined with an aggressive modeling approach to explain these important and fundamental observations that are critical to understanding the earthquake cycle of subduction zones and are crucial in seismic hazard assessment. <br/><br/>This project also includes teaching Research Methods of Seismology and GPS.

The investigation will consist of three stages. First, a basin model will be constructed using industry well logs and seismic reflection data. Second, numerical simulations of previously recorded earthquakes in the region will be performed using supercomputing clusters. Third, the basin model will be iteratively improved using the results of the numerical simulations in a procedure known as adjoint tomography.  The resultant three-dimensional structure will be interpreted in the context of the local active tectonics, such as the delamination of the adjacent Sierra Nevada.  Results from the earthquake simulations will be used to assess the seismic hazard in the San Joaquin basin.<br/><br/>The Great Valley lies west of the Sierra Nevada and east of the Coast Ranges. It is the largest agricultural producer in the United States, a major oil producer, and home to more than 6.5 million people.  The southern portion of the valley, the San Joaquin basin, is filled with several kilometers of sediment that makes the valley prone to enhanced and prolonged shaking during earthquakes.  The region is surrounded by active faults, including the San Andreas fault to the west and the White Wolf and Garlock faults to the south.  The basin is one of the most prominent tectonic features in southern California, yet its structure and seismic response are not well known. The findings of both the seismic hazard and the active tectonics will be conveyed to the communities of the San Joaquin basin, with emphasis on Bakersfield, which has the largest population and greatest seismic risk."

Ubicomp is the premier outlet for novel research contributions that advance the state of the art in the design, development, deployment, evaluation and understanding of ubiquitous computing systems.  Ubicomp is an interdisciplinary field of research and development that utilizes and integrates pervasive, wireless, embedded, wearable and/or mobile technologies to bridge the gaps between the digital and physical worlds.  More information about the conference is available online at http://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp2009.  This interdisciplinary workshop, the first of its kind in the United States, will bring together researchers from a variety of scientific domains, from engineering, and from architecture, to identify opportunities and challenges in the emerging field of architectural robotics, that is to say robotics technologies embedded in the built environment.  Throughout history the emergence of new technologies has reshaped our built environment and so, society.  Workshop participants, about 20 of them supported under this award, will share their research and teaching, and explore issues relating to the design of complex engineered systems that respond to human needs and wants.  They will wrestle with questions such as: What new vocabularies of design need to be cultivated, and what theories of self-reconfigurability defined, in order to lay the foundation for sophisticated algorithms that will sense and infer the occupancy, activities, and external conditions of a building so as to trigger change that improves life, enhances existing places, and supports human interaction?  And:  How can we educate students from different academic backgrounds to collaborate productively in teams, and what tools could further teaching and learning in the design and implementation of architectural robotics?   The PIs expect the workshop to launch a viable new research community, by serving as a catalyst for future knowledge exchange, collaboration and growth.  To these ends, event outcomes will include publication of a collection of position papers and set of references (including academic papers), as well as Web sites and other media that pertain to this new field of research.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The gradual embedding of robotics throughout the built environment will have a broad impact on society as these technologies support and, in some cases, augment everyday work, school, entertainment, and leisure.  Early applications will likely be in health care, in support for persons with physical disabilities, in the empowerment of a growing populating wishing to age in place, and in intelligent work spaces that are responsive to changing needs, that consume less floor space, and that reduce energy costs.  The educational activities in the workshop will explore methods of teaching multidisciplinary classes that bridge the academic cultural gaps that separate engineering, human-centered design, and architecture and its allied design and art practices.   The PIs will make every effort to ensure a diverse group of participants including representatives of underrepresented groups in science and engineering such as minorities, women, and persons with disabilities."

Specifically, the extent to which changes in locomotor behavior over time influence changes in skeletal anatomy will be investigated.  Infant chimpanzees are typically carried by their mothers when traveling and principally move using their upper limbs.  In contrast, juvenile chimpanzees move entirely by themselves, relying more on quadrupedal locomotion.  Quadrupedal knuckle walking increases as individuals age.  These behavioral transitions are predicted to result in correlated changes in anatomy, with an initial increase in lower limb bone strength and shape as chimpanzees mature from infancy to juvenility.  A second change, in knuckle morphology, related to the stress of knuckle-walking, is expected to occur as individuals age and spend more time moving quadrupedally.  <br/> This project will integrate observations of chimpanzees in the wild with measurements of bones in museums and analysis conducted in the laboratory.  Fieldwork will be conducted in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to document the locomotor behavior of chimpanzees of different ages.  Chimpanzees will also be filmed to analyze individual variation in performance within and between locomotor modes.  Chimpanzee skeletons from museums will be analyzed using morphological measures, micro CT scanning, and digital photography. <br/> Chimpanzees are our closest living relatives and their behavior likely includes elements shared with our ancestors.  A systematic study of how chimpanzee movement affects the shape of bones may enable us to identify morphological features induced by behaviors such as knuckle-walking, bipedalism, and suspension.  These features can then be used to reconstruct locomotor behavior in fossil apes and humans and provide a better understanding of how humans evolved into bipedal creatures. Results promise to shed light on problems relevant to several fields of study, including functional morphology, bone growth and development, and human evolution.<br/>"

The work will determine if the inclusions indicate initial conditions of magma formation or if they are modified by late-stage processes occurring at shallow crustal levels.   The sample suite comes from the FAMOUS segment of the mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic.  This study represents the first comprehensive, quantitative, and consistent dataset of olivine melt inclusions for multiple samples.  Samples are phyric and primitive in composition.  They have well-developed local variations that have been ascribed to melting column effects.  Geochemical work includes the analysis of major, volatile and trace elements in melt inclusions from 15-20 samples.  Questions to be addressed include: (1) are unusual compositions a common feature of melt inclusions from various samples; (2) is the occurrence of these unusual compositions related to segment position, lava type, or mineralogy; and (3) are major and trace element variations consistent with predictions from petrogenetic models or are they better explained by diffusion in the host crystal.  Broader impacts of the work include engaging undergraduates in research and incorporation of results into university courses.  It will support a postdoctoral fellow whose gender is under-represented in the sciences and increase bonds between a French and US laboratory.  The work will also be featured in a new exhibit at the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH).   Geochemical data will be archived in PetDB. a public and Internet accessible database funded by NSF."

Traditional studies of diversity have focused on comparing traits between distant groups but such an approach tells little about the mechanisms that cause the differences between closely related species. Darwin's Finches in the Galapagos Islands comprise a group of fourteen closely related species that has evolved extreme diversity of their beak shapes and sizes. Similarly, the Caribbean Bullfinches, an independently-evolved group of closely related species, display similar levels of beak variety. This second group provides an ideal opportunity to test whether the genetic tool kit that fueled the diversity of beak shapes in Darwin's Finches is shared with other species. The researchers will perform analyses of gene expression in natural populations of both groups of birds followed by experiments with beak development in chicken embryos in the laboratory. This project will 1) establish which genes are involved in generating the highly specific seed-eating beaks of Darwin's Ground Finches and 2) investigate whether the same genes are used in a different group of birds to adapt to similar environments. The results of this research will aid the general understanding of how embryological processes generate variation within and among species.<br/><br/>The interdisciplinary nature of this project, combining fieldwork and developmental genetics in an evolutionary context, will involve collaborations with scientists from several fields of biology. The work involves international collaborations and training, plus the involvement and mentoring of undergraduates in field and laboratory methods."

The PI with collaborators will study the Schubert calculus of flag varieties of affine Lie groups.  This includes understanding the geometry of Schubert varieties and the combinatorics of the polynomials representing Schubert varieties in (co)homology and K-(co)homology.  Together with co-workers, the PI will also develop a theory of total positivity for loop groups, and for their flag varieties.  The theory being developed generalizes the classical Edrei-Thoma classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group.  Furthermore, new combinatorics for Coxeter groups occurs, including a weak order for the limiting elements of a Coxeter group.  In another direction, the PI with collaborators will study the convex geometry of the affine Coxeter arrangement, and in particular, certain polytopes which occur in the study of affine Schubert varieties and total positivity of the affine Grassmannian.<br/><br/>The PI's research is in the area of combinatorics, which studies how to count discrete objects. The PI studies combinatorial problems which arise from geometry (studying shapes of objects in space) and algebraic structures (studying solutions to polynomial equations).  One of the on-going themes of the PI's work is the study of (positive) numbers which arise in mathematics.  These numbers may occur when counting the ways geometrical objects interact in space, or by couting certain solutions to polynomial equations.  In particular, the PI aims to understand the ""positive"" part of a geometrical figure in the same way the positive real axis is the ""positive"" part of the real line.  The PI's work will have a significant impact on the understanding of the relationships between geometry, algebra, and combinatorics.<br/>"

This variability may have important consequences for estimating C pools and fluxes given the contribution of landsliding to the removal of organic C contained in vegetation and soil from the hillslopes, its deposition along the hillslope-fluvial interface, and its subsequent regeneration on landslides undergoing succession.  This project will develop a landscape approach for quantifying C budgets associated with landsliding based on the integration of spatial (maps) and non-spatial (field measurements of C in vegetation, soil, and water) data into a GIS modeling framework for a model watershed in the Sierra de Las Minas, Guatemala. Whereas the model will generate subwatershed- and watershed-scale estimates of carbon pools and fluxes, the field data will permit a comparison between the C isotopic composition of soils, landslide deposits, and water and therefore provide a better understanding of C transfer to the fluvial system.<br/><br/>The development of a landscape approach to examine watershed and subwatershed-scale C pools and fluxes associated with landsliding is a first step towards understanding the regional impact of landslide populations on C budgets, and ultimately its influence on global climate.  Furthermore, this proposal will shed light into the factors that underlie slope instability in a tropical mountain range, including recovery processes.

Despite this effort, much uncertainty remains, especially with regard to gaseous nitrogen losses. This is particularly troubling in the context of human modification of the nitrogen cycle, which is dramatically increasing nitrogen pollution, runoff, and the emission of nitrous oxide, a radiatively important greenhouse gas. This research will contribute to our understanding of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle by quantifying the role of ""Feammox"", a newly discovered pathway in the global nitrogen cycle. Feammox is the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium coupled to ferric iron [Fe (III)] reduction. It has the potential to produce inert dinitrogen gas as well as reactive nitrite, which could subsequently be reduced to gaseous or organic nitrogen, or ammonium under anaerobic conditions. Given the potential gaseous loss of nitrogen from terrestrial environments, this pathway may play a significant role in the global nitrogen cycle. The proposed research will place this newly discovered nitrogen transformation pathway in the context of the larger nitrogen cycle by (i) determining if Feammox is mediated by soil microbes, and if so identify the responsible organisms, (ii) determining the relative importance of iron- and nitrogen-containing compounds as controls on Feammox, and (iii) quantifying the role of Feammox in total nitrogen gas emissions from soils.  <br/><br/>The collaborative research between a soil biogeochemistry laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley and a microbial biogeochemistry laboratory at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln will improve the mechanistic understanding of terrestrial nitrogen cycling. Field work will take place at the Luquillo Long Term Ecological Research site in Puerto Rico.  The research addresses a previously unquantified pathway in terrestrial ecosystems that not only has implications for nutrient retention in soils, but could also evolve nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas implicated in global change.  This project will support for an early career female scientist, two graduate students, one undergraduate student, and one postdoctoral researcher.  In concert with sample collection in Puerto Rico workshops and training activities will be held for Puerto Rican high school students.

In countries such as the US this process manifests principally as suburbanization. Our understanding of the specific causes and consequences of suburbanization -- an under-studied form of landscape change -- is limited because we also lack a systematic baseline description of the location, extent, timing, and rates of the changes where the process is suspected to be important. These knowledge gaps are increasingly being filled by ""land change"" and ""vulnerability"" assessments, or the integrated studies of the process, and why it matters to stakeholders. This REU Site project will build on 9 years of success engaging undergraduate researchers through the Human-Environment Regional Observatory (HERO) program, which operates on the REU Site approach. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Two research streams are proposed. The Forest Change Monitoring stream will produce validated measures of spatial & temporal forest composition changes in a landscape (Massachusetts) dominated by heterogeneous species assemblages and ownership groups. This stream will also contribute to the ?best-practices? literature for remote sensing applications, by articulating challenges and opportunities associated with constructing and maintaining a long-term, semi-automated satellite imagery-based forest monitoring program. The Vulnerability Assessment stream will examine the social causes and consequences of, and responses to, land-cover changes in the suburban Boston area, using remote sensing, statistical, and survey analytical techniques. Research products from both research streams will contribute to both substantive and methodological literatures on land use-environment, suburban studies, landscape ecology, and geographic information science.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research proposed here will produce salient results that provide resources for practitioners and suburban communities experiencing rapid changes associated with their development patterns; publications will be produced for both scholarly and stakeholder (e.g., USFS, NASA, federal/state/municipal/community groups, elected officials) audiences.

Current soil improvement methods to safeguard against liquefaction are often very expensive and their applications are limited to new sites.  There is an urgent need to develop cost-effective liquefaction mitigation measures that can be applied to new sites as well as sites where structures exist.  The PI and CO-PI have been conducting research on developing an innovative method for liquefaction mitigation based on inducing partial degree of saturation in otherwise fully saturated liquefiable sands.  The research to date has demonstrated the technical feasibility of the method.  Laboratory tests have led to the conclusion that introduction of gas bubbles in sand, thus reducing its degree of saturation, prevents the occurrence of liquefaction.  While the feasibility of induced partial saturation as a potential liquefaction mitigation measure has been successfully demonstrated, it is the PI and CO-PI?s ultimate goal to further advance this mitigation measure, prove its feasibility through field research tests so that the professional engineering community considers its application in practice.  This will require implementation of a comprehensive research program with testing under large scale laboratory and field conditions.  However, such a research program can not be embarked nor funding can be secured unless two distinct and important research goals are first achieved. <br/><br/>This SGER award focuses on these two research goals.   The first goal of the proposed research is to devise a delivery system that can generate gas bubbles in fully saturated sands that can be implemented with high likelihood of success in the field.  This gas delivery system should be practical and be able to reduce the degree of saturation of sands rapidly and uniformly. The second important goal is to devise a field testing technique that can be used to assess the effectiveness of the gas delivery system leading to validation of partial degree of saturation, as well as the uniformity of the site remediation. <br/><br/>Results from preliminary investigations suggest that oxygen bubbles can be generated within sands through the introduction of chilled water with dissolved ?Efferdent? (primarily sodium perborate), or through chilled hydrogen peroxide with an added catalyst to release oxygen when temperature of the fluid rises.  Also, it is apparent that the use of a piezocone and measurement of excess pore pressures developed during the penetration of the piezocone into the sand can be a practical and rapid way of validating partial degree of saturation and its uniformity.  These exploratory research activities will be conducted using the SoilBed facility of the Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems (NSF-ERC-CenSSIS) <br/><br/>The outcome of this research can help advance efforts at developing a cost-effective liquefaction mitigation measure that can have world-wide impact on safety and protection of property from earthquake hazards.  Development of cost-effective oxygen delivery system can also help in situ bioremediation method to be more widely implemented in practice.  The research is collaboration between faculty and students in the fields of earthquake engineering and geoenvironmental engineering.  Such interdisciplinary collaborations have led to innovative ideas and continue benefiting undergraduate and graduate students engaged in the research<br/>"

Some of the topics that will be included are : Physics from CDF and D0 at the Tevatron,  Supersymmetry and the Higgs Phenomenology at the LHC, Sparticles and their detection at the Large Hadron Collider,Extra dimensions, Flavor problem and CP violation, the interconnections of dark matter and the LHC physics, LHC new physics signatures and simulations, and Neutrino physics and proton stability.  The broader impacts are that many students will participate and give talks in parallel sessions at SUSY-09. This would be an important opportunity for them to interact with a wide group of active researchers in their area to achieve a broader perspective of developments on the frontiers of physics  The Physics program of the conference will help in the discovery of new physics beyond the Standard Model. This would have important implications for the development of high energy theory and string theory in the coming decades.The conference will enhance international collaboration among groups working on similar projects."

The proposed framework exploits and unifies three concepts: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, nonparametric kernel density estimation, and information theoretic optimality measures. Developed techniques will be illustrated in a brain interface, in which high dimensional spatiotemporal electroencelaphogram activity will be translated to intended commands for a robot. This interface will be designed to facilitate fusion with myoelectrically controlled neural prostheses.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Conventional techniques relying on nonlinear programming of semiparametric models with low-order statistical criteria, which is prone to various difficulties including model complexity selection and existence of suboptimal solutions, cannot cope with the challenges of increasingly complex engineering problems. Proposed work facilitates the adaptation of nonlinear models exploiting smooth generalized linear models and principled information processing in a novel unified framework. This will advance the state-of-the-art in nonlinear adaptive signal processing and machine learning. The brain interface testbed will facilitate future collaboration between two currently disconnected neural prostheses communities.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The theoretical framework will impact signal processing and machine learning, thus will have immediate influence on fields that rely heavily on statistical modeling, data analysis, and processing techniques. Specifically, contributions to the emerging neural engineering field will impact the design of future neural prostheses, as well as fundamental brain and cognition research. The project will help educate graduate engineers with mathematical rigor and an interdisciplinary focus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Their enzymes are critical to biofuel production. Despite their importance, there is little known about how many fungi obtain food. Mycorrhizal fungi obtain sugars from plants in exchange for helping their host plants take up nutrients, and saprotrophic fungi obtain their energy and nutrients from decomposition of dead organic matter. Whether fungi switch between nutritional strategies is a key question in the evolutionary ecology of fungi. Recently, measuring carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14 isotopes has been shown to reliably assess nutritional strategy, and therefore provides new opportunities to examine the evolution of nutritional strategies in fungi.  This study will use archived fungi from Australia, Asia, and the US to conduct a broad survey of fungal nutritional strategies.  A site-specific study at the Harvard Forest research site in Massachusetts will also be used to examine whether fungi can switch nutritional strategies.  These studies will greatly expand knowledge on the links among fungal function, phylogeny, and ecology.  The broader scientific impacts of the proposed research will result from integrating functional (isotopic) methods and genetic methods in a novel collaboration that should stimulate interest within the larger community of evolutionary biologists, ecologists, and mycologists.  These methods could be readily expanded to Europe and Africa to include the global distribution of mushroom-producing fungi.  This project will also incorporate current scientific research into specific educational activities designed to inspire future scientists including high school (fungal forays), college (Clark University's ACE Summer Institute, Research Experience for Undergraduates at Harvard Forest, the UNH Undergraduate Research Conference), and graduate students."

As an example, the order in a polymer liquid near a solid interface will exhibit a transition from solid-like, molecular layering in the fluid near the interface to more liquid-like order further from the interface.  The extent over which this transition occurs is commonly denoted as the penetration depth, and is found to be directly related to the temperature, the solid-liquid molecular interactions, and the surface structure of the solid.  Given that the magnitude and extent of the layering has pronounced effects on the electrical, mechanical, and optical properties of the film, understanding the stability or time-evolution of the molecular layering in the film is extremely important.  A major motivation for the current approach comes from a recent computer simulation study by the PI that shows that the extent of layering in an alkane film next to a solid substrate oscillates in time with an amplitude and period that strongly depend on temperature.<br/><br/>Atomic-scale computer simulations will be used to study two major topics: is the observed oscillation in the extent of the layering with time a general property of other polymer melts near solid surfaces, and what are the nucleation kinetics involved in the formation and growth of the ordered monolayers near the polymer melt/vapor interface during the surface freezing phase transformation. This research will provide an atomistic-scale explanation to the structure and dynamics of polymer molecules near interfaces. Our detailed investigation on the adsorption of polymer films on different surfaces will provide us with the means of understanding how nucleation barriers can be altered by appropriate surface templates.<br/><br/>As part of the education component, undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project will be trained in this area of materials research that is interdisciplinary between chemistry, physics, and materials science, and the students will also develop computational skills applicable to these disciplines.  Major efforts will be made to recruit minority and female students.  Additional educational outreach efforts are planned that will develop a seminar program on ""Physics in Africa"" for inner city schools with a goal of increasing enrollment of African-American students in STEM degree programs, as well as a collaborative effort at SIUC to develop a computational science course that will integrate computer simulations into a science methods course for certified and in-training high-school teachers.<br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This CAREER award supports research and education involving the computational and theoretical study of how polymeric liquids are structured near a solid interface, and how this ordered structure changes with time.  One of the major differences between liquids and crystalline solids is that liquids show no ordering over long distances as solids do.  At  a liquid-solid interface (e.g., a solvent in a glass container), however, the molecules in a liquid usually align into thin films with the alignment decreasing with distance from the solid surface.  This research will use computer simulations to examine how this ordering for polymeric liquids changes with time.  Given that the magnitude and extent of the layering has pronounced effects on the electrical, mechanical, and optical properties of polymer films, it is extremely important to understand the stability or time-evolution of the molecular layering in the film.  This research will not only contribute to the fundamental understanding of molecular ordering at interfaces, but it will also have huge potential in addressing problems encountered in industry, such as producing uniaxially oriented mesostructured films which are very desirable for electronics, optics, and sensors.<br/><br/>As part of the education component, undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project will be trained in this area of materials research that is interdisciplinary between chemistry, physics, and materials science, and the students will also develop the computational skills useful for these disciplines.

What is the right functorial definition for compact moduli spaces of higher-dimensional varieties (and what might they be good for)?  To what extent does the birational geometry of moduli spaces govern the behavior of related Geometric Invariant Theory problems, and vice versa?  These questions are intertwined in intricate and beautiful ways:  Intersection-theoretic constructions govern curve classes on both the moduli space of stable curves and holomorphic-symplectic varieties.  The Torelli Theorem for K3 surfaces is the starting point for their moduli theory;  the lack of such a result for higher dimensional holomorphic-symplectic manifolds is a major impetus for analyzing their ample cones.  The elusive dream of a geometric compactification for the moduli space of K3 surfaces animates work on the interplay between Geometric Invariant Theory and moduli spaces.<br/><br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects defined by polynomial equations, which are called varieties.  Examples of varieties include circles, ellipses, parabolas, spheres, etc.  A fundamental problem is to classify all the varieties of a given type.  One approach is to analyze all the varieties defined by polynomials of given degree, e.g., the conic sections studied in high school analytic geometry.  Here the type of the variety is expressed in algebraic terms.  Alternately, one can study all the varieties sharing common geometric characteristics, e.g., those with given numerical invariants.  This project addresses the interplay between the algebraic and geometric quantities, and how these govern the behavior of families of varieties.<br/>"

Over the last sixty years, the transistor has been reduced from several centimeters to a few tens of nanometers, with each device now more than 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.  As sizes are reduced further, quantum effects become critically important in determining device properties.  At the same time, it becomes increasingly difficult to acquire information about the detailed geometry and material quality of the devices.  In the last decade the ultimate limit of this scaling has been reached with the development of single-molecule transistors (SMTs), where the critical channel for current is a small molecule 1-2 nm in size.  These devices are excellent tools for examining the physics of conduction at the nanoscale, including the origins of dissipation and the importance of electron-electron interactions.  This award supports a project with the goal of extending SMT studies beyond electrical conduction to include measurements of electrical noise.  Noise, in the form of fluctuations in the current through the device, is predicted to provide valuable information about both vibrational and magnetic processes within SMTs.   Two graduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art nanofabrication methods and will use both low- and high-frequency techniques to measure the noise in SMTs under various conditions, thus preparing them for future academic or industrial careers.  If successful the research results will provide new insights into the physics relevant to future technologies, while the work itself will open the door to further new measurements, including the detection and manipulation of single electron spins. <br/><br/>****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****<br/>Single-molecule transistors (SMTs) have been developed over the last decade, and have been outstanding tools for examining the physics of conduction at the nanometer scale.   SMTs are highly quantum mechanical systems where electron-electron, electron-vibrational, and spin-based interactions can all be strong.  One persistent challenge in understanding such structures is the limited information available through DC characterization of electronic conduction.  Higher frequency measurements of conduction as well as shot noise can provide much deeper insight into the roles of electron-vibrational and strong correlation effects.   Shot noise in particular gives information about the correlations between electron tunneling events.  This award supports a project to use both low- and high-frequency methods to measure shot noise in SMTs under various conditions.  In SMTs containing unpaired electrons, shot noise will be used to test the theoretical prediction that the effective charge of the electron is modified to a fractional value when transport takes place via the Kondo process.  These measurements will lay the groundwork for the eventual development of high frequency ?RF-SMTs? and possible single-molecule electron spin resonance.  This program will provide state-of-the-art training of two graduate students in nanoscale science fabrication and measurement techniques thereby preparing them for future careers in academic or industrial research."

Third, the PI will apply the Fredholm<br/>theory in polyfolds developed by Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder to<br/>explore newly emerging invariants from the theory of polyfolds<br/>with operations.<br/><br/>Symplectic geometry is the study of spaces equipped with the<br/>basic structure that underlies Hamiltonian mechanics, for which<br/>preferred coordinates give both position and momentum of a moving<br/>object and in which conservation of energy is natural and<br/>inevitable. The Floer homology theory referred to in the first<br/>paragraph studies such manifolds through the critical point<br/>behaviors of certain auxiliary spaces; this kind of analysis of<br/>critical points goes back to work of Marston Morse circa the<br/>1930s, but its application in the modern context requires new<br/>tools such as the polyfold theory cited above."

Even though they consume only a small fraction of sedimentary organic matter (OM), deposit feeders influence the rate and extent of OM diagenesis by increasing oxygen penetration into sediments, redistributing particles, and stimulating diagenetic activity throughout the mixed layer. Sedimentary organic resources simultaneously determine, and are determined by, the activities of the benthic infauna. Understanding how deposit feeding and OM diagenesis interact is critical to developing realistically coupled biological/chemical models of carbon cycling in marine sediments. <br/><br/>In this study, investigators at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography and the University of Texas at Austin will study linkages and feedbacks between OM diagenesis and deposit-feeder ecology by examining the foraging behavior of a conveyor-belt feeding orbiniid polychaetes (Haploscoloplos robustus) in experimental microcosms. Effects of sedimentary OM concentrations on individual feeding rates, patch density, and rate x density interactions will be examined from an optimal foraging perspective. Documenting the dynamic balance among individual functional responses, sediment mixing, microbially-mediated organic transformations, and nutrient assimilation is a major focus of the proposed study. To study the coupled organism-microbe-sediment system, a novel isotopomer-based 13C tracer experiment is proposed. Bacterial co-metabolism of sedimentary carbon and labeled OM additions will lead to the formation of bacterially-synthesized OM having molecular 13C isotopic signatures that are distinct from both the (12C) sedimentary carbon and the added (13C) OM. Measurement of the incorporation of added label into a bacterial amino acid and fatty acid pools and subsequently deposit feeder biomass will be used to trace the fate of carbon as a function of H. robustus feeding rate and population density. Feedbacks among OM diagenesis, microbial production, and worm foraging behavior and growth will be quantified by independently manipulating organic supply, population density, and sediment mixing rate.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this research project will feature several inter-institutional collaborations and will involve the training one graduate student (at UT) and two undergraduate students from the SkIO/Savannah State CIRE internship program."

This project aims to address these materials science issues through a tightly coupled experimental and computational effort. High quality AlN, InN, and their alloys are grow epitaxially and the high quality samples enable detailed characterization of surfaces, point defects, and impurities using structural, electrical, and optical techniques. Electron accumulation layers on the surface are investigated and controlled. The limits of n-type and p-type doping will be pushed. The experimental effort is directly tied to state-of-the-art first-principles calculations based on density functional theory; the ""band-gap problem"" will be addressed through the use of techniques that have recently successfully been implemented, such as quasi-particle calculations and hybrid functionals. Deep (localized) and shallow (extended) levels of defects and impurities are investigated, as well as surface reconstructions and surface states. Closing the loop between theoretical and experimental results is expected to provide deep understanding of fundamental atomic-level mechanisms and phenomena associated with synthesis and processing of these novel materials.<br/>Non-technical: This project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The wide-band-gap semiconductors that are the focus of the investigation are recognized as the prime materials for light emitters throughout the visible and into the ultraviolet, and the transition to solid-state lighting will have tremendous impact both in the developed as well as the developing world. Nitrides are also starting to gain ground in the area of high-frequency devices, with applications in telecommunications and radar. Another area of high potential impact is for photovoltaics, where the nitride materials systems can span the range from ultraviolet to infrared. This project has significant educational value: the graduate students are involved in a tight collaboration between theory and experiment. In addition, the computational project will make use of the brand new Allosphere facility at the California Nanosystems Institute at UCSB. The Allosphere is a 3-story-high spherical space in which a fully immersive and interactive virtual environment can be experienced. It will be helpful with the visualization and understanding of wave functions and bonding environments in the various materials, as well as with the dissemination of results to a broad audience."

The design criteria is for a device that provides for low cost, high throughput production at bench-scale as well as having the flexibility for a fully automated commercial-scale production system. In the Phase I portion of the project, a point-to-point construction format will be used to model the concept and demonstrate the technical feasibility of coupling the upstream biomass production with the downstream protein purification into a seamless production system. A key enabling facet of the design concept is the integration of Athena's novel expression system for the production of recombinant proteins. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are for lower production cost of recombinant proteins. The production and purification of proteins remains a rate-limiting step for basic and applied research as well as for commercial production. The general approach for producing large quantities of recombinant protein involves multiple steps that are physically and functionally separated. Consequently, it is a labor intensive process that is not readily amenable to parallel or high throughput operations. One means of addressing this is by linking the processes together; yet no system is available where the cell culturing and protein purification operations are coupled into one integrated fully-automated system. The device envisioned here will solve this by allowing for the automated large-scale production of recombinant proteins in a seamless system.<br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."

Variational inequalities provide an effective means to<br/>derive properties of solutions of evolution equations and likewise, evolution equations can be used to derive variational inequalities. Exploiting this interplay has been very fruitful in the past, and the investigators plan to approach various problems using this perspective. One is to find correction terms of various examples of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality by exploiting a surprising connection to the porous medium equation and to the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. In particular, a correction term for the logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality will lead to an improved understanding of the solutions of the Keller-Segel model describing the chemotaxis of certain bacteria. A similar philosophy applies as well to certain problems in kinetic theory, with the plan to derive quantitative estimates on speed of approach to equilibrium for some inhomogeneous master equations of Kac type. These investigations tie in with analogous questions in quantum mechanics. Here the PI's plan to prove hypercontractivity estimates for Lindblad operators that describe dissipative quantum mechanical systems, with the aim to obtain quantitative estimates on the speed of approach to equilibrium as well. Another circle of problems is proving Lifshitz tails in the random displacement model. The aim there is to understand the conductivity properties of materials.<br/><br/>Many phenomena in science and technology can be modeled by evolution equations. An interesting example, treated in this proposal, is the Keller Segal model, that models the aggregation, or the absence thereof, in the motion of bacteria. Understanding the behavior of solutions of these equations is both biologically and mathematically interesting. Likewise, it is widely observed thatn systems of many interacting particles, either classical or quantum mechanical, evolve toward an equilibrium, and they do this at a certain speed, often largely independent of the number of particles. Understanding this, and determining this speed is one of the objects of this research. Another question of great interest is what distinguishes a conductor from an insulator. There are simple models in quantum mechanics that are supposed to exhibit these kind of behavior. While it is impossible to understand these phenomena by exact computations, using mathematical techniques notably from analysis, the PI's aim to understand these processes better. Conversely, applied problems, e.g., the porous medium equations that describes the seepage of water in dams, can be used to find interesting mathematical facts, which in turn lead to improved understanding of other problems. It is this interplay of pure and applied mathematics that is the focus of the PI's research and it has been an excellent way to educate graduate students as well as undergraduates, and to draw them into mathematical research."

The technical goal is to detail the limits of validity of reported flow instabilities in entangled polymer melts and solutions. The flow of polymer fluids in conventional rheometers is generally assumed to be nearly viscometric and stable. When instability or secondary flows occur, it is generally acknowledged that such measurements cannot be used to determine material parameters. This is important in any experimental challenge to, e.g., a molecular theory such as the reptation model of polymer chain dynamics. According to a new set of results that has appeared in the literature, the basis for the experimental verification of the reptation theory is, in fact, based upon experiments from non-homogeneous flows. If this is true, it changes the paradigm for the dynamics of polymer fluids in nonlinear deformation regimes. However, much of the community is skeptical of these results and there are multiple reports in the literature of contradictory results. Hence, it is paramount to establish the range of both flow conditions (rate and magnitude of shear) and material parameters (e.g., entanglement density) for which such observations are correct and the range where errors may have been made and to do so in a way that the results are accepted by the community at large. The present proposal is constructed to do this. The groups collaborate through an innovative set of student teams having one representative from at least three institutions for all experiments. Success of the work is defined as achieving an interlaboratory consensus of the flow profiles in polymer solutions and melts. Objectivity is developed by having multiple labs with multiple students performing each type of experiment so that ?neutral eyes? have the major influence in the examination of experimental data. Three types of experiments will be performed, each will be performed in at least two labs and one will be performed in all labs. The experiments are particle tracking velocimetry, confocal microscopy fluorescence dye velocimetry and macroscopic parallel plate-cone and plate comparisons of nonlinear properties. <br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The major paradigm of polymer rheology is the reptation theory. Because reptation is the present paradigm for polymer flow, it is widely used in industrial settings to understand how to change molecular parameters in making advances in polymer processing. There are several offshoots to reptation theory as well that are beginning to be adopted in industry. Yet, recent work has appeared that is being strongly advanced to challenge this paradigm. It has reported strong flow instabilities which would invalidate the reptation theory in the regime relevant to polymer processing. Hence establishing whether or not the reported flow instabilities occur in industrially relevant ranges of flow rates is important. The present proposal brings together collaborators from four U.S. and one foreign university (Texas Tech University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cornell University and Illinois Institute of Technology,Technical University of Eindhoven in the Netherlands) with the goal of establishing the range of experimental conditions where such flow instabilities occur. Because the general community has not uniformly accepted the reported results, the present collaboration will provide both repeat (for validation purposes) and novel experimentation to establish the range over which the reported results are relevant and how they impact the current understanding of polymer nonlinear rheology and its basis in molecular (reptation) theory. The present proposal does this. In addition, because of its structure as a collaborative work through an innovative set of student teams having one representative from at least three institutions for all experiments. All students will participate in the collaboration with the Technical University of Eindhoven."

How species will respond to these changes in their environment is a crucial piece of that understanding. Species have four main ways to deal with climate change: extinction, range shifts, behavioral or non-genetic changes, and evolution. Using an existing experiment which simulates different climate change scenarios in temporary ponds, the PIs will subsample experimental ponds for the water flea Daphnia pulex. These Daphnia will be raised in a controlled environment and various traits will be measured to learn if they have undergone evolutionary change or if the responses reflect a plastic (non-genetic) response. The results will provide data that will help in understanding how species are confronting a rapidly changing world. The study will address whether, in the face of climate change, populations will adapt through evolution to novel environments, or respond through non-genetic adjustments within their ranges of physiological tolerance. <br/><br/>This grant will be used to train and mentor high school students and college undergraduates in both the field and the laboratory. Students will gain not only practical field and laboratory skills, but also exposure to a variety of scientific disciplines including ecology, evolution, mathematics, and computer science.

The carbon dynamics of tropical forests are dependent on climatic conditions, such as cloud coverage, solar radiation, and temperature. At short time scales, i.e. within a year, climate influences forest productivity directly by controlling rates of photosynthesis and respiration. Over longer periods, climate changes may alter forest 3D structure and composition, but this is difficult to determine because large areas of forest are needed to assess this, and collection of field data can be problematical. Thus, studying the spatial and temporal interactions among forest structure, composition and carbon dynamics requires new methods. This study utilizes a new airborne imaging system, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), which measures properties of scattered light, and hyperspectral imaging, which provides information using a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, to develop detailed 3D maps of forest structure. Microclimate and leaf physiology data will be collected simultaneously to develop and validate a high-resolution 3D model of forest photosynthesis. By using a study transect comprising three km2 of tropical forest situated along an elevation gradient, it will be possible to quantify effects of forest structure, composition and climatic differences on forest photosynthesis and productivity at scales not before feasible. <br/><br/>This project will develop a new tool for large-scale and cost-effective monitoring of forest carbon dynamics.

The proposed approach takes advantage of branched macromolecules that possess three characteristic properties: mesoscopic size, well-defined shape, and mechanical tension in their covalent bonds. These properties become particularly evident in branched macromolecules tethered to a substrate which enhances steric repulsion between the densely connected branches. To alleviate the confinement-induced stress, branched macromolecules may opt to either undergo orthogonal phase separation leading to intercalation of chemically different molecules or break the linker leading to molecular cavities in the film. The significant implications of these phenomena call for fundamental studies to shed light on the role of the branched architecture in micro-structuring of thin polymer films. With thin intention in mind, it is proposed to investigate two complementary systems: (i) branched macromolecules on liquid substrate and (ii) and branched macromolecules tethered to a solid substrate.  One will study thermodynamics and kinetics of molecular intercalation to understand the mechanisms and the length scale of the pattern formation. The experimental studies will guide the design of branched architectures and will be used to verify the theoretical predictions for molecular conformation and microphase separation in thin films.  <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project will generate new materials and physical tools for controlling microstructure of thin polymer films on molecular length scales, which carry vital implications for microelectronics, data storage, photonics, and fuel cells. The outreach plan includes three key areas of activity: (i) nurturing prospective scientists through comprehensive participation of high-school students in research, (ii) the development of molecular imaging techniques for university and high-school classrooms, (iii) broadening participation of underrepresented groups through collaboration with the suc-SEED Project. The project will also strengthen collaboration between the chemistry departments at UNC, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Athens, and Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne. The interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the proposed research program provides rich opportunities for preparation of students for the competitive global economy where researchers must work together across disciplines and geographic distances, as well as organizational, cultural, and personal differences.<br/><br/>"

Preliminary ethnographic research in the Cameroonian capital, Yaoundé, indicates that elite consumers may gain prestige and alliance benefits in the covert trade of increasingly rare forest animals. If confirmed, this finding would challenge the prevailing notion that urban poor Africans are the primary consumers and traders of wildlife. The explanation for this difference may lie in the distinction between the market for rare species, which involves elite consumers and high prices, versus common species and everyday trading.<br/><br/>Randolph will use ethnographic methods to investigate the role of kinship, social status, and economic status in the distribution and consumption ""bushmeat."" She also will collect data to construct ego-centric networks through which she will study social and demographic traits of consumers and sellers, hidden social aspects of the urban trade, and the cultural prestige benefits derived by individual consumers. <br/><br/>Understanding the segmentation of the bushmeat trade will enable more effective partnering of conservation and development policies to simultaneously address urban livelihood issues for traders and targeted trade regulation for threatened and endangered species. Additionally, because bushmeat consumption has been linked to a variety of health issues, the project will contribute to public health policy. This project is particularly significant because of the urban focus of the research, an aspect of African wild game market studies that remains largely unstudied. Through collaborative efforts with the Johns Hopkins Cameroon Program and the training of Cameroonian university students as research assistants, this research will also contribute to capacity building and shared knowledge with African partners, as well as the training of an American social scientist."

DeHanas<br/>University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill<br/><br/>Immigrant second generation youth in Europe, particularly young Muslims, have been the subject of frequent concern and controversy over public expressions of religious faith.  How does religion influence the kinds of citizens second generation youth are becoming?  More specifically, in which ways do religious identities provide resources or constraints for the development of national identity, political articulacy, and active civic engagement?<br/><br/>This dissertation research will contribute to a social scientific understanding of religion and citizenship with a comparative study of second generation Bangladeshi youth (largely Muslim) and Jamaican youth (largely Christian) in London, England.  The youth will be aged 18 to 25, male and female, and systematically selected from the East End and Brixton, two similarly mixed-income and ethnically concentrated areas of Inner London.  A total of 120 in-depth semi-structured interviews will be conducted, 40 with Bangladeshis, 40 with Jamaicans, and 40 with religious leaders and other local residents.  These interviews will be complemented by ethnographic observation in eight systematically selected area mosques and churches that draw significant attendance from second generation youth.  With its mixed methods and comparative research design, this dissertation is uniquely placed to investigate and explain the various pathways by which Muslim, Christian, and non-religious youth develop identities and practice citizenship.<br/> <br/>This dissertation will have broader impacts in at least three important ways.  Significant research attention is now given to the integration of young second generation Muslims in Europe.  A first broader impact of the dissertation will be to expand that research agenda by comparing young Muslims to the often ignored, but numerically similar, population of young second generation Christians, providing new comparative insights.  Second, this study will inform policy makers who address the concerns of the study populations, as it promises to illuminate the role of religion in citizenship and ways in which young people can develop into more fully engaged citizens.  Finally, there are plans for written and presented dissemination of the findings to both academic and non-academic audiences in the U.S., Britain, and elsewhere in Europe.  Each nation has different immigration patterns and integration policies, and audiences will gain insights from the dissertation that can be applied to their own particular social contexts."

Udvardy, will investigate the gender effects of asylum and post-repatriation experiences of involuntary migrants. The research will be carried out among Dinka migrants who originated in Bor, South Sudan, but experienced two different asylum environments: Kakuma refugee camp in northern Kenya and Khartoum, in the north of Sudan. This comparative framework will allow her to determine if alterations to gender norms and relations that occurred during asylum are the result of different asylum environments and if these alterations remain intact after migrants are repatriated.<br/><br/>The researcher will undertake 12 months of field research in Bor, South Sudan. She will conduct 56 semi-structured interviews to investigate the causes of change to gender norms and relations during asylum and after return. The interviews are designed to examine the gender relations and norms of male and female Dinka and the strategies these Dinka women used to engage with gender inequality during three phases of the forced migrant experience: 1) prior to departure, 2) during asylum, and 3) post-repatriation. Information obtained in the interviews will be triangulated with data on observed behavior recorded through participant observation and a time allocation study.<br/><br/>Existing gaps in repatriation research and theory results in refugee policy and humanitarian assistance that fails to meet the needs of returning forced migrants. Missing from current repatriation policy is the recognition of the gendered elements of repatriation. This research directly addresses this need by examining and establishing 1) the primary causes of change to gender norms and relations during asylum and after return, and 2) the strategies women use to deal with gender inequality during asylum and after return. By addressing these current gaps in repatriation literature, this research will expand the current limitations of migration theory and improve current repatriation and post-conflict reconstruction policy and intervention projects. The research also will contribute to the education of a graduate student."

The Center's goal is to improve the public health through enhanced understanding of how oceanic processes affect the distribution and persistence of biological agents with potential human health consequences. WHCOHH researchers have interacted extensively with other OHH centers and scientists, as well as government officials responsible for public health. WHCOHH has supported 13 competitively awarded pilot projects and leveraged its resources by attracting new awards for related research. <br/><br/>With funding through this Accomplishment-based Renewal, the WHCOHH will continue to build upon recent discoveries and ongoing research activity in two major areas:<br/><br/>1. HAB Theme: A recent major accomplishment at the Center was the identification and characterization of the massive bloom of Alexandrium fundyense in the Gulf of Maine in 2005. This resulted in decisive management action that protected the public health in much of coastal New England. Models incorporating hydrodynamics and biological aspects of A. fundyense gave an accurate prediction of another severe bloom in New England in 2008. Apparently, this was the first-ever successful seasonal forecast of a red tide anywhere in the world. Genetic and physiological analysis of A. fundyense populations sampled during 2005-2008 yielded a unique dataset for testing hypotheses about how toxic dinoflagellate blooms form and change. Based on these results, the HAB research team will formulate a suite of population dynamics models for the multiple genotypes of A. fundyense, which differ dramatically in terms of growth rates and cellular toxin content. They hypothesize that the aggregate distribution of A. fundyense is composed of a mosaic of genetically distinct subpopulations, each with different physiological and/or behavioral responses to environmental conditions. The goal is to understand the hydrodynamic and biological controls on these populations, their toxin production, and how these factors ultimately determine fluctuations in shellfish toxicity. This HAB research will be augmented by additional field observations in a nearby salt marsh (Nauset) which has hydrodynamic connections to the regional HAB outbreaks. Instrumentation will be deployed for automated detection of A. fundyense, further advancing the technologies that can be used to manage these dangerous phenomena. <br/><br/>2. Pathogen theme: Recent research on pathogens at the Center has included studies of Vibrio species, studies on marine refuges of a variety of other human pathogens, and groundbreaking studies on the rare biosphere. Investigators uncovered microevolutionary dynamics of populations of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the environment by establishing a population genomic framework. This enabled them to determine the mechanisms of genome differentiation and their effect on population structure on different temporal and spatial scales. Such information permits differentiation of the effects of selection and demographics on bacterial populations and the pathogenic variants that are embedded within those populations. Building on accomplishments pertaining to Vibrio species, the pathogen team will now (1) determine the relationship between population structure and origin of the recently isolated coastal Vibrios and related human pathogens; (2) explore diversity, horizontal gene transfer, and the ecological role of virulence genes; and (3) determine host range, genetic diversity, and potential for gene transfer of vibriophages. As follow-up research in microbial community structure and low-abundance human pathogens, the team will (1) determine the temporal and spatial distribution of indicator organisms and pathogens in beach sands and (2) identify assemblages of potential indicator organisms as proxies for the occurrence of human pathogens. <br/><br/>The Center will also be conducting a cross-cutting activity that will link HAB and pathogen studies in the Nauset Marsh System. High-resolution microbial population profiles will be compared with A. fundyense population data to assess potential correlations. A subset of these same samples will be analyzed for routine indicator organisms as well as other human pathogens. <br/><br/>The Broader Impacts of the Center's previously funded and new research activities span all five categories defined by NSF. Teaching, training, and learning have been promoted via entrainment of more than 80 students and postdoctoral fellows thus far, with underrepresented groups participating in all levels of center activities. The WHCOHH genomics core facility and Alexandrium culture collection constitute significant investments in infrastructure for research and education. Extensive outreach efforts lead to broad dissemination of our results, and close connection with public health officials have had demonstrable benefits to society. These benefits are expected to continue to develop during the next two years.of renewal funding."

The conference has an excellent track record for highlighting the work of younger investigators and women. To ensure a high level of diversity for such a small meeting graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty and underrepresented minorities at all levels are invited to attend. To encourage participation by junior investigations a special lecture will be presented by a graduate student who has written the best Ph.D. thesis since the previous meeting. The 2009 meeting focuses on advances made using the combined power of genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, electrophysiology, imaging, and behavioral analysis to address fundamental issues in neurobiology. The topics covered will range from (i) sensory systems coding and topographic mapping of inputs for odor, taste, vision and mechanosensation (ii) behavioral analyses of reproduction, locomotion, feeding, and social interactions; (iii) higher brain functions such as memory, learning, sleep, choice and attention; (iv) developmental and functional analysis of brain circuits; (v) synapse development and plasticity; (vi) embryonic and metamorphic development of the brain; and a newly-devised session on (vii) the impact of comparative genome analyses on neural evolution. As a result of feedback from previous participants this meeting will remain of moderate size (430 participants) and will have no parallel sessions so as to facilitate discussion, exchange of ideas and techniques, and to promote new collaborations in this rapidly-evolving field. All applicants will be encouraged to submit an abstract and the majority of participants will present a talk or poster. Speakers will be chosen by session leaders and meeting organizers from the most timely and interesting abstracts submitted a few months in advance of the conference: this will ensure that late-breaking science is covered in all of the talks. It is expected that the findings and approaches presented at this meeting, as it is true for those held over the last 25 years, will result in novel and significant advances in our understanding of basic neurobiology in other organisms."

This symposium is sponsored by the Division of Polymeric Materials: Science and Engineering (PMSE). The co-organizers of this symposium are the PI and Prof. Qing Wang at Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University. With the soaring of global oil prices and global warming, energy crisis has become a pressing issue that challenges everyone?s standards of life, societal security, and economy. Advanced functional materials including polymers start to play an unprecedented role in our ultimate objective of sustainable and clean energy production, energy transportation & storage, and end uses. As a timely symposium on the energy issues, this symposium focuses on applications of advanced polymer nanocomposites in electric energy storage, polyelectrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, and organic photovoltaics. Three objectives are aimed: 1) This symposium is going to highlight the frontier scientific research and technologies in advanced polymer nanocomposites for energy storage and conversion by invited presentations from international and the U.S. academic institutions and industries; 2) It is also going to shine lights for the future directions of polymer nanocomposites for energy storage and conversion<br/>applications. 3) Educational efforts will be endeavored to enhance the national awareness of the feasibility and importance of polymer nanocomposites for energy storage and conversion. Although the past ACS symposiums have highlighted polymer nanocomposites, this symposium is the first one in ACS to emphasize their applications in energy storage and conversion. Intellectual Merit This symposium will provide a forum for researchers from interdisciplinary fields to present and exchange their cutting edge and/or unpublished results of functional polymer nanocomposites for capacitors, PEM fuel cells, and solar cells. It also provides an excellent opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to learn from the invited talks and<br/>from one another by participating in oral and poster presentations. Broad Impact due to the timely energy focus, this symposium will receive significant attention from a broad range of chemistry, physics, and materials researchers in the U.S. and world wide. Preprints of all invited talks, contributed talks, and posters will be published in the Spring 2009 volume of the PMSE Preprint. This symposium encourages participation of young/starting investigators, female researchers, graduate students and postdocs from both academic and<br/>industries.

This crucial event, called fertilization, involves cellular processes such as differentiation, motility, information exchange, recognition, fusion and development that lay at the heart of modern biology. This is an exciting time to hold a conference in the field of fertilization and early development as some basic concepts in gamete physiology are being revised. The seventeenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on fertilization and the activation of development will provide a forum for presentation and discussion of new developments and ideas in this exciting, rapidly advancing field. This is the only GRC concerned with gamete interaction leading to the vital process of fertilization and activation of the fertilized egg to begin the process of embryo formation. It provides an excellent atmosphere that promotes rich interactions amongst biochemists, cell biologists, molecular biologists, physiologists, geneticists, and biophysicists working in the field. This conference has been singularly successful in fostering collaborations among scientists with widely disparate experience and seniority and, among research laboratories in this country and in Europe, Japan, Australia and Latin America. These collaborations have led to many fruitful results. Since 1974, researchers, postdoctoral fellows and students from the field keep attending this conference; when asked, many indicate ""it is the best conference in the field"". Fundamental concepts and insights about the molecular mechanisms involved in fertilization come out of the sessions and individual discussions that the format of this meeting promotes. Without doubt, this knowledge eventually impacts clinical issues in reproduction and human well-being."

Is the behavior intentional? What is the person's goal, what is she thinking, what is he feeling? Is this behavior good or bad? And does it reveal the person's personality? Answers to these questions demand social inferences: conjectures about the other person's intentional behavior, thoughts and feelings, and morality. Previous research has provided some insight into each of these inferences, but they were always studied in separation. In real life, different types of social inferences occur simultaneously within the human perceiver and must also be studied simultaneously in research. This project's first objective is therefore to investigate the relationships among these multiple inferences. Is there a hierarchy of social inferences -- a priority by which people infer intentionality, mind, and morality? (For example, do people assign blame to somebody even before they infer the person's specific goal?) How frequently and how fast are these inferences made, and do some inferences compete with each other or speed each other up? (For example, are inferences about goals faster than those about personality and do inferences of intentionality speed up inferences about blame?) The project's second objective is to investigate which information contained in an observed behavior triggers the various inferences -- that is, exactly what do people look at when they infer a behavior's intentionality, the actor's emotion, or the blameworthiness of the action? To conduct this research, the PI developed a theoretical model and experimental paradigm for the simultaneous examination of multiple social inferences. Unlike previous research that used written sentences to elicit social inferences, the present project presents videotaped human behaviors as dynamic experimental stimuli. Thus, while perceivers make social inferences as they normally would in real life, the researcher uses computerized presentation and measurement to assess the frequency and exact timing of these inferences. Moreover, with a fine-grained tracking of the perceiver's eye movements while watching the behaviors, the researcher can capture the specific information on which these inferences are based. <br/><br/>By providing a clearer understanding of the fundamental social capacities involved in inferring intentionality, mental states, and morality, this project will inform legal processes, models of autism (where these capacities have been shown to be deficient), relationship counseling, and cross-cultural communication. Illuminating the exact processes by which people interpret each other's behavior will help meet a key challenge in contemporary society: to improve communication and avoid misunderstandings in personal, business, and political interactions. Furthermore, the theoretical and methodological innovations in this proposal will provide scientists with valuable new tools for the study of human social cognition. Finally, because many of the proposed studies can be conducted on a portable laptop computer, they permit recruitment of diverse community members who would normally not enter the psychologist's laboratory. The proposed research will be integrated into training and teaching of undergraduate and graduate students, benefit from national and international collaborations, and will be disseminated in scientific publications and communities across multiple disciplines."

Over the course of this three-year project the investigators and their students will test the hypothesis that the expression of the collagen gene found in serves a unique mechanical role in maintaining colony integrity in this photosynthetic, nitrogen-fixing neurotoxin-producing organism. The hypothesis will be tested with static and dynamic cell culture, protein isolation and purification, a collagen gene knock-out model, atomic force microscopy imaging, and transmission electron microscopy of fibrillogenesis experiments. <br/><br/>If we are able to establish the hypothesized mechanical role that collagen serves in this organism, we will not only gain valuable insights into the nanoscale mechanics of cell colonies, but also into cyanobacteria ecology. The presence of this collagen within T erythraeum may represent an interdomain gene transfer event that occurred during the Devonian or Silurian period from a multicellular organism such as a vertebrate (Layton et al., 2008 J Molecular Evolution 66 539-554), into an ancestor of modern marine bacteria, endowing a prokaryote with the ability to gain access to additional food sources via neurotoxin concentration and gill-clogging mechanisms. The specific collagen gene found in this organism also has potential applications for the tissue engineering, such as an alternative to Matrigel, programmed collagen expression, or accelerated wound healing. Outreach to the local K12 community through a 2-week NSF-RET-style teachers program to be held during the summer quarter at Drexel University will give teachers from local high schools with the greatest need, enhanced access to the important recent scientific discoveries in cell and protein mechanics, evolution and nanotechnology."

Supernova contamination of forming planetary systems has many observable consequences for the elemental abundances of stars. The contamination determines the inventory of short-lived radionuclides such as Aluminum-26 or Iron-60 in young stellar systems, and is a major driver of planetary evolution and the delivery of bioessential volatiles to Earth-like planets. <br/><br/>To determine the effects of supernova contamination, Dr. Desch and his students will numerically model the interaction of supernova ejecta with protoplanetary disks and with fragments of molecular clouds on the verge of collapse. They will also create a computational tool to allow exploration of dust dynamics and thermal evolution in these and other astrophysical flows. <br/><br/>The proposed research connects research and education by advancing discovery and understanding while at the same time educating undergraduate and graduate students, including one named student from an underrepresented group.

During annual salmon migrations and spawning, salmon-derived nutrients (SDN) enter streams and influence both organisms and ecosystem function. For example, stream algae and macroinvertebrates increase during salmon runs and decaying salmon carcasses provide for longer-term SDN storage in streams. Previous research has shown that the effect of SDN in streams is not always consistent, but dependent on stream structure and regional climate patterns. In this study, a suite of ecosystem-scale metrics will be measured on streams in the Great Lakes region to complement a similar dataset from Southeast Alaska. These two regions have differing stream structure and climate, and the comparison will provide an understanding of the underlying controls that determine ecosystem response to SDN subsidies. As a result of human actions, some streams have diminished salmon runs, particularly from dams or over-fishing, while others receive increasingly larger runs as a result of hatchery stocking. Therefore, a thorough understanding of how stream structure and climatic conditions determine the influence of SDN subsidies is necessary for effective management of current salmon runs in both native and introduced ranges. <br/><br/>The comparative inter-biome approach will allow managers to assess and predict the response of SDN subsidies on a range of stream ecosystems, enhancing the potential success of stream restoration and salmon conservation projects. Results will be disseminated to appropriate Federal agencies and non-governmental organizations such as The Nature Conservancy."

Microforming is one of the miniaturization technologies with great potential for high production rates. There is great potential for miniature parts that cannot be microformed due to part complexity, low material formability, inhomogenuity, severe tribological conditions and other size effects, to be successfully produced by ultrasonic assisted microforming. In this research, the influence of ultrasonic vibrations on material flow characteristics, material formability, and tribological conditions will be studied through analytical modeling, numerical, and experimentation. Analytical models for predicting temperature generation caused by ultrasonic vibrations, coupled with temperature induced due to plastic deformation will be established. Through experimentation, the transformation of material characteristics due to temperature rise caused by ultrasonic vibrations at different energy levels will be studied. The effect of ultrasonic energy on the reaction response of lubricant chemicals at the tool-workpiece interface will also be studied with an ultimate goal of identifying suitable and effective lubricant chemicals for this process. <br/><br/>If successful, the fundamentals established from this study will be used to build a knowledge-base for developing cost-effective manufacturing method for 3D-miniature parts via ultrasonic assisted microforming. The knowledge gained from this research may lead to novel warm microforming process techniques, where billet heating is achieved through the heat energy induced from ultrasonic vibrations. This research will be of significant value to manufacturers of miniature parts and developers of microforming machine systems for mass production of hollow and solid micro parts. Biomedical, electronics, ordnance, and communication industries are expected to benefit from this technology due to high demand of miniature parts. Research findings will be incorporated into manufacturing courses and dissemination through seminars, conferences and journal articles. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research."

Unfortunately, with few exceptions, no further properties of this metric are known. In this project the P.I. will study how the topology of the 3-manifold and the properties of the hyperbolic geometry are related to each other. A first goal is to obtain explicite estimates of geometric data in terms of topological and combinatorial information such as the rank of the fundamental group of the Heegaard genus of the manifold. The second goal is to use these geometric information to reconstruct, under suitable assumptions, the hyperbolic metric itself.<br/><br/>A 3-manifold is a mathematical object of fundamental interest. For example, the space we live in is a 3-manifold. A recent trend in the study of 3-manifolds is to encode as much of their fine, infinitely complicated, geometric structure in finite combinatorial models. A certain amount of information is lost in the process. The goal of the project is to quantify how much information actually gets lost. Obtaining concrete a priori estimates is then crucial. For example, they open the door to predictions in terms of finite models of phenomena occurig in 3-manifolds. <br/>Surprisingly, it seems very likely that in many situations sufficiently precise a priori estimates will allow to recover all the geometric information. Concrete estimates will make possible to have accurate computer simulations."

Natural language processing applications saw orders of magnitude improvement when statistical processing/machine learning was applied to massive data sets. Some linguists observe that these improvements level off at some point, and that subsequent improvements come only after domain knowledge (in that case, linguistic theory) is also applied to the processing. There is a similar situation in science. While some application areas in a Petabyte Age might require only non domain-specific machine learning to predict phenomena (what Chris Anderson calls ?agnostic statistics?), others will require the deeper understanding of phenomena that most scientists seek.

Finally, the data integration necessary for the proposed visualization requires managing much larger volumes of data, and many more different kinds of data.

Based on the PI's previous work, and the work of others, it is now clear that IUPs form a diverse set of protein families that can elicit biological function using a variety of mechanisms. This project has two aims: (I) Determine structural ensembles for a set of homologous proteins that are intrinsically unstructured. In this specific aim, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement will be used to estimate long-range interatomic distances that can be used to restrain structure calculations. The structural ensembles will then be validated using residual dipolar couplings and small angle x-ray scattering. (II) Determine the relationship between sequence identity and structural similarity for a set of homologous proteins that are intrinsically unstructured. In this specific aim, eigenvector decomposition of protein contact maps will be used to identify similarities between the structural ensembles. This data will then be correlated with genetic distance matrices to determine the percent sequence identity necessary for structural similarity. Experiments in this specific aim will also test the importance of amino acid composition for specifying the structural ensemble. Successful completion of both specific aims will facilitate the development of models of protein evolution for intrinsically unstructured proteins that can be used to estimate their dynamic structures based on sequence identity. <br/><br/>The PI has a strong record of advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning. This is evidenced by the three peer reviewed publications that have undergraduate students as authors and five peer reviewed publications that have authors from underrepresented groups. The PI is also very committed in disseminating scientific information to general public. In the summer of 2004, the PI participated in a state funded workshop for secondary education to science teachers. The PI gave lectures on the general principles of protein structure and function as well as a tutorial for using molecular graphics programs in the classroom. This project will involve two undergraduate students and a female research technician and the PI will continue his efforts to involve science teachers in basic scientific research by holding an annual workshop whose purpose would be to introduce science teachers to the latest breakthroughs and make them aware of new web-based tools for scientific discovery."

To do this, the researchers will construct Bayesian models for two rare plant species, Calochortus tiburonensis and Pedicularis furbishiae, Calochortus tiburonensis and Pedicularis furbishiae, using external data from closely related congeners. These two species were originally studied in the 1980s, and the original populations will be re-censused. Estimates of the extinction risks and 2009 population sizes derived from different models will be compared with information on the populations obtained from contemporary censuses. <br/><br/>This research provides one of the first tests to determine the appropriateness of using external data in Bayesian PVA. The results will be applied to improving conservation and recovery plans for the rare species studied.

Dr. Swanson will research the mysteries of dark energy and neutrino mass using the upcoming galaxy surveys of the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Differences in fundamental physics lead to changes in the large-scale clustering of matter, so one can use the universe as a particle physics laboratory by measuring this clustering with surveys cataloging large numbers of galaxies. However, galaxy formation physics also impacts the clustering, which leads to systematic uncertainties in measuring dark energy and neutrino properties. This project will develop a detailed understanding of these uncertainties and apply them to the upcoming generation of galaxy surveys. The methods used will be as follows: first, build theoretical models encoding galaxy formation physics and test them by comparing to current surveys and simulations. Next, use these models to compute the uncertainties expected from future galaxy surveys. Finally, develop analysis methods to apply to future survey data that will optimize the physics results. The primary objective is an analytical framework to account for galaxy formation physics when extracting information about dark energy and neutrinos from survey data.<br/><br/>Dr. Swanson will also develop and teach an enrichment course in cosmology for Boston area high-school students through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Educational Studies Program. She will collaborate with the CfA Science Education Department to develop and assess the curriculum for the course, which will focus on helping students break down commonly-held misconceptions about astonomy and cosmology using inquiry-based techniques, observational projects using the MicroObservatory online telescopes, and computer simulations and visualizations. Dr. Swanson will make the curriculum materials publicly available online as modules for physics and astronomy teachers at high schools and colleges worldwide and also as an interactive online course for anyone who is curious about the nature of our universe."

The technical goal is to detail the limits of validity of reported flow instabilities in entangled polymer melts and solutions. The flow of polymer fluids in conventional rheometers is generally assumed to be nearly viscometric and stable. When instability or secondary flows occur, it is generally acknowledged that such measurements cannot be used to determine material parameters. This is important in any experimental challenge to, e.g., a molecular theory such as the reptation model of polymer chain dynamics. According to a new set of results that has appeared in the literature, the basis for the experimental verification of the reptation theory is, in fact, based upon experiments from non-homogeneous flows. If this is true, it changes the paradigm for the dynamics of polymer fluids in nonlinear deformation regimes. However, much of the community is skeptical of these results and there are multiple reports in the literature of contradictory results. Hence, it is paramount to establish the range of both flow conditions (rate and magnitude of shear) and material parameters (e.g., entanglement density) for which such observations are correct and the range where errors may have been made and to do so in a way that the results are accepted by the community at large. The present proposal is constructed to do this. The groups collaborate through an innovative set of student teams having one representative from at least three institutions for all experiments. Success of the work is defined as achieving an interlaboratory consensus of the flow profiles in polymer solutions and melts. Objectivity is developed by having multiple labs with multiple students performing each type of experiment so that ?neutral eyes? have the major influence in the examination of experimental data. Three types of experiments will be performed, each will be performed in at least two labs and one will be performed in all labs. The experiments are particle tracking velocimetry, confocal microscopy fluorescence dye velocimetry and macroscopic parallel plate-cone and plate comparisons of nonlinear properties. <br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The major paradigm of polymer rheology is the reptation theory. Because reptation is the present paradigm for polymer flow, it is widely used in industrial settings to understand how to change molecular parameters in making advances in polymer processing. There are several offshoots to reptation theory as well that are beginning to be adopted in industry. Yet, recent work has appeared that is being strongly advanced to challenge this paradigm. It has reported strong flow instabilities which would invalidate the reptation theory in the regime relevant to polymer processing. Hence establishing whether or not the reported flow instabilities occur in industrially relevant ranges of flow rates is important. The present proposal brings together collaborators from four U.S. and one foreign university (Texas Tech University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cornell University and Illinois Institute of Technology,Technical University of Eindhoven in the Netherlands) with the goal of establishing the range of experimental conditions where such flow instabilities occur. Because the general community has not uniformly accepted the reported results, the present collaboration will provide both repeat (for validation purposes) and novel experimentation to establish the range over which the reported results are relevant and how they impact the current understanding of polymer nonlinear rheology and its basis in molecular (reptation) theory. The present proposal does this. In addition, because of its structure as a collaborative work through an innovative set of student teams having one representative from at least three institutions for all experiments. All students will participate in the collaboration with the Technical University of Eindhoven."

These wires are nanometer to micron wide traces patterned within an indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive layer. ITO typically absorbs 1 to 10% at visible and infrared wavelengths, depending on its thickness. Localized heating of ITO occurs when the optical intensity passing through the conductive trace exceeds about 1 mW/mm2. The temperature change produces a proportional resistance change that can be measured electronically. This detector samples and transmits light with nearly zero insertion loss. By incorporating this patterned ITO coating within traditional antireflection coatings and thin film interference coatings, novel detection schemes can be developed. Moreover, by reducing the dimensions of the trace to the nanometer scale, the detector also has the potential for high-speed operation with a bandwidth approaching GHz.<br/><br/>The broader impacts/commercial potential of this project will be a detection technology that enables a wide range of new optical monitoring applications by eliminating costly and bulky assemblies. For instance, inexpensive and miniature optical monitors can potentially replace the ten million passive fiber optic connector adapters produced annually for fiber optic communication systems. By transparently measuring the optical power through fiber optic junctions in a low cost fashion, advanced self-monitoring and self-diagnosing communication network architectures can be realized for Fiber-to-the-Home and data centers. This technology promises to reduce the cost to measure power within optical fibers by two orders of magnitude. These detectors have the potential to be mass-produced on flexible plastic film, window glass, mirrors, or even on curved substrates such as light bulbs and lenses.<br/><br/>""This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."""

Shimura varieties form one of the main testing grounds for conjectures of Langlands on the calculation of Hasse-Weil zeta functions of algebraic varieties over number fields in terms of automorphic L-functions. The zeta function is defined as a product of local zeta functions, over all prime ideals in the field of definition. <br/>At primes of good reduction, the approach of Langlands and Kottwitz has been completed, thanks in part to the recent proof of the Langlands-Shelstad conjecture (""fundamental lemma"") due to Ngo, Laumon, Waldspurger, and others. When singularities exist in the reduction modulo a prime ideal, geometric and representation-theoretic difficulties arise, which the PI will investigate. An important role will be played by some new ""fundamental lemmas"" which were not predicted by Langlands and which are formulated using Bernstein's decomposition of the category of smooth representations of a p-adic group. Another ingredient will be a decomposition of nearby cycles in a manner parallel to Bernstein's decomposition, and geometric arguments showing these nearby cycles give rise to test functions in the Bernstein center of the associated p-adic group.<br/><br/>Many deep results in number theory involve the expression of a purely arithmetic object (such as a zeta function) in terms of a purely analytic object (such as an L-function). The latter are functions of a complex variable originating in the classical theory of modular forms, which are functions on the complex upper-half plane satisfying very stringent symmetry conditions. Several famous conjectures (e.g. the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, a Clay Math foundation Millennium Problem) postulate relations between values of zeta functions and arithmetic invariants. Shimura varieties form an important class of objects where links between arithmetic and analysis can be fully carried out. Progress in their study often has impact on other central questions in automorphic forms: a recent example is the proof due to M. Harris and R. Taylor of the local Langlands conjecture for general linear groups over p-adic fields. The PI will seek to further our understanding of Shimura varieties and other aspects of the Langlands program."

This novel mixed brush system offers previously unavailable opportunities (i) to produce mesoscopic surface patterns of various length scales by long-range-frustrated lateral phase separation between the two chain types and (ii) to create functional interfaces with surface properties switchable between charged and non-charged states. These properties, achievable only with this unique combination of ionizable and neutral polymers with laterally-mobile grafting points, have enormous potential to be used for advanced technological purposes in such areas as (i) functional surface patterning for advanced fabrication of two-dimensional nano/microstructures and (ii) biomedical delivery and detection. Understanding of the thermodynamics that governs the behavior of the mixed brushes is essential to furthering the development of these technological applications. The specific objectives of this research are to establish and understand the key thermodynamic properties, including (a) two-dimensional phase behavior, (b) phase-separated domain structures, (c) lateral brush compressibility and (d) chain conformations, of a model mixed brush system constructed using mixed diblock copolymers at the air-water interface. This mixed brush system will be studied using combined experimental techniques of fluorescence/AFM imaging, pressure-area isotherm and neutron/x-ray reflectivity measurements, to establish how the brush molecular characteristics (i.e., polymer molecular weights, brush composition, and chain grafting density) and the solution electrostatic environment (i.e., pH and ionic strength of the medium) influence the above-mentioned properties of the mixed brush system. These experimental investigations will be complemented by self-consistent field (SCF) theoretical studies to establish a consistent and theoretically sound understanding of the experimental results.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed research is that, by using a unique combination of experiment and theory, this research will provide a useful understanding of the phase behavior and structures of this new class of mixed polyelectrolyte brush system. The knowledge gained from this research will also have great implications for developing a generalized understanding of the ?frustrated phase separation? phenomena widely observed in various materials ranging from biological cell membranes to two-dimensional electronic systems. The broader impacts of the proposed activities are far reaching. Formulating the surface of a material with a mixed polyelectrolyte and neutral polymer brush represents a new paradigm applicable, as a generic methodology, to a wide variety of advanced technologies, including nano/micro fabrication and biomedical technologies, and the proposed research will provide the fundamental materials science groundwork necessary for further technological development in these areas. The proposed research will provide integrated training for graduate and undergraduate students in a multidisciplinary, collaborative and intellectually stimulating environment to learn skills necessary for the future generation of polymer/soft materials scientists. Aspects of the proposed research will be used to enhance curricula in the areas of polymers and nanomedicine."

Thus, the primary function of mRNA is to serve as a template for protein synthesis. Recently, the applicant discovered a novel structural function of the Veg T mRNA in frog (Xenopus laevis) germ cells (oocytes). It was found that VegT mRNA also has a role in maintaining the integrity of the cytokeratin cytoskeleton of the cell. Experimental removal of this mRNA from oocytes results in the disruption of the cytoskeleton and leads to the abnormal development of embryos. These findings suggest that mRNA has, in addition to initiating protein synthesis, a structural function in the organization of the cellular cytoskeleton. The applicant will map the regions on the VegT mRNA, which are required for maintaining structural integrity of the cytoskeleton by using mutagenesis and X-ray microscopy/tomography imaging techniques. X-ray microscopy/tomography techniques allow much better resolution than light microscopy, and are not subject to the artifacts encountered with conventional electron microscopy. <br/>     This conceptually novel discovery of a role for mRNA in maintaining the structural integrity of the cellular cytoskeleton establishes a new paradigm, and should open new frontiers in the study of RNA function. The involvement of high school, undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in this project, with the focus on the involvement of minority students, will ensure that these novel scientific concepts and methodologies will be disseminated among apprentices."

Barbasch will continue and extend his previous work to find necessary and sufficient conditions for unitarity for classes of Langlands parameters such as principal series in  real and p-adic groups. The aim is to find proofs that are as uniform and conceptual as possible, and express the answers in a closed form.  Unipotent representations are (conjectured to be) the building blocks of the unitary dual. Their character theory plays an important role in the theory of automorphic forms. Barbasch will study the character theory  of unipotent representations in the real case, with an emphasis on relations to endoscopic groups, particularly twisted ones. Realizations of unipotent representations as local factors of automorphic forms, and in the context of the dual pairs correspondence are also envisioned.  This research will provide a deeper understanding of representation theory of reductive Lie groups, in particular unitary representations, which play an essential role in the applications of representation theory to automorphic forms, mathematical physics analysis and geometry. <br/><br/>This research will generate problems suitable for Ph.D. theses as well as combinatorial problems for undergraduate research. Together  with several faculty members at Cornell, Barbasch will run the ``Sophus Lie Days at Cornell'' an instructional conference designed to expose undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics and other sciences to the theory of Lie groups and their representations, one of the aims being to  get them interested and involved in research at an early stage.

Specifically, the impact of magnetic field-assisted processing on piezoelectric/magnetostrictive (PZT/Terfenol-D) thin film composites will be explored. PZT and Terfenol-D are highly anisotropic materials and therefore significant property enhancement in each material is expected from enhanced texturing. The observed magnetoelectric effect in the composite system is due to strain coupling at the interface. Thus, the thin film texturing independent of the substrate obtained here will allow an arbitrarily large number of layers to be deposited. More layers will result in more interfaces, leading to an even greater enhancement of the composite properties. Furthermore, the selected processing routes are scalable to industrial manufacturing. Deliverables include a deeper understanding of the role of magnetism in materials processing and new processing paths for functional single phase and composite multiferroics. This research will also offer a multidisciplinary research experience for two graduate research assistants in engineering.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will demonstrate heteroepitaxy-like properties via a low-cost, high speed manufacturing process. This will result in compact, cost-effective devices that are capable of accomplishing sophisticated magnetoelectric tasks. Example applications include high sensitivity, portable, magnetic field sensors (for example in healthcare applications such as brain activity monitoring), terrestrial magnetic field energy harvesters, etc. Devices made possible by the research will offer the advantages of planar fabrication, a flat initial state, and monolithic composition.

The Loewner equation has as input an arbitrary continuous function and produces a continuous family of conformal mappings. Marshall plans to investigate properties of the solutions of Loewner's equation under various assumptions on the driving function, and conversely to investigate how properties of the boundaries of the associated regions are reflected in the driving function. This is a classical problem where progress has been made only recently. The Loewner equation is also related to an algorithm for numerical conformal mapping discovered by Marshall and K\""uhnau. Marshall will analyze convergence and error-estimates for the ""zipper""' algorithm and improve the speed of convergence using ""generational""' techniques. <br/><br/>Conformal mappings have been used as a tool in science and engineering for many years. They are often used to change coordinates from a complicated region to a simpler region like a disc. A partial differential equation on the complicated region is then changed to a similar equation on the disc, a setting where it is easier to solve. Classically, this method was used for problems related to Laplace's equation, such as electrostatics and two dimensional fluid flow. Numerous non-classical applications have been developed in the last three decades such as electro-magnetics, vibrating membranes and acoustics, transverse vibrations and buckling of plates, elasticity, and heat transfer. The Loewner differential equation was introduced in 1923 to study extremal problems for conformal maps in the unit disc. Schramm's recently invention of stochastic Loewner evolution SLE, the fusion of Loewner's differential equation and probability, has formed a bridge between the important areas of conformal mapping in mathematics and conformal field theory in physics. It has led to the discovery of new results in percolation and random walks, for example, as well as the discovery mathematical proofs of results known to the theoretical physics community. This project is likely to increase the understanding of solutions to Loewner's equation, as foundational work, which should increase its usefulness in understanding stochastic processes. Broader impacts include the continued improvement and dissemination of the conformal mapping computer codes, which have been used by a number of investigators not in mathematics, as well as by mathematicians. Greater speed and new knowledge of convergence should lead to wider applicability and use of this algorithm. The mentoring of postdoctoral scholars and graduate students through our complex analysis ""working seminar"", has supported the work of several women. Support of our research increases the number of students interested in pursuing a career in this direction."

DuBois' The Philadelphia Negro (1899 [1996]), examines the socio-political and cultural factors that gave rise to racial and socioeconomic change in Philadelphia generally and specifically the 7th Ward, DuBois' primary field site. Using the 7th Ward -- one of the oldest black urban neighborhoods and first neighborhood of any kind to be studied extensively by an American sociologist -- as a case study, this study focuses on answering the following question: How did the heterogeneity and residential decisions of blacks in Philadelphia affect neighborhood change and patterns of within-city migration from 1880 to 2000? While many scholars have focused on national economic trends and policy decisions, this research focuses on what black people were saying to each other and the decisions amongst themselves as central to an understanding of urban neighborhood change. Furthermore, while other studies consider one historical period of urban change in a city, this research charts the effects of the black migration north and internal divisions within Philadelphia?s black community and patterns of within-city migration on neighborhood change over many historical periods. To uncover the effects of the heterogeneity and residential practices of blacks on neighborhood change, this research studies the socio-political history of the 7th Ward between two empirically driven time points derived from census data and urban sociological literature: 1880, which marks the prominence of the 7th Ward as a black residential neighborhood and begins a period of increased in-migration rise of southern black migrants to Philadelphia and immediately precedes DuBois' study, and 2000, which marks the disappearance of black residents and follows the publication of the centennial edition of The Philadelphia Negro (1996). The project uses archival data (e.g. census data, local newspapers, institutional records, city and neighborhood maps, church records and oral histories) and secondary data located in Philadelphia, Pa and Washington D.C.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research sheds light on the lasting and latent effects of black migration both into and within Philadelphia and cities of the like. While latent and lasting effects of social phenomena, particularly those involving mass movement, are often opaque and difficult to track, this research helps to clarify these effects and their implications for the current and future spatial mobility of urban blacks. Highlighting the impact of black migratory patterns and intra-racial divisions this research promises to yield information pertinent to contemporary spatial patterns and urban changes. This study will also be instructive for understanding the potential effects of contemporary migration south by urban blacks."

Approximately 850-1,000 scientists and students from around the world will attend. The conference focuses on the molecular biology, genetics, genomics, biochemistry and cell biology of filamentous fungi. This biennial conference is considered by most to be the pre-eminent meeting in the area of fungal biology, and promotes interaction between researchers interested in plant pathogens, medical pathogens, saprobic fungi and symbiotic fungi. Having everyone staying at one site facilitates the type of informal discussions that often lead to the development of new collaborations and research directions. <br/><br/>The formal meeting will consist of four plenary sessions, four sets of concurrent sessions devoted to specialized areas, and three poster sessions. The topics to be covered in the plenary sessions are 1) genome evolution and dynamics, 2) pathogenic and symbiotic interactions, 3) gene regulation and metabolism, and 4) signaling, development and sex. Topics to be covered by the 27 concurrent sessions include 1) associations between fungi and humans, 2) associations with plants, 3) dimorphic transitions and morphogenesis, 4) secondary metabolism, 5) sex and development, 6) evolutionary genetics and genomics, 7) RNA functions, epigenetics and chromosome biology, , 8) natural products and small molecules, 9) metabolomics and proteomics, and 10) teaching fungal biology and genetics, to name a few. Based on previous meetings, the organizers expect around 700 poster presentations. <br/><br/>From a broader perspective, fungi are model eukaryotes that have aided in the understanding of basic biological processes beginning with Beadle and Tatum's 1940's work demonstrating, for the first time, the relationship between genetics and biochemistry. Fungi have also been important as models to help elucidate disease in animals and plants. This meeting places a strong emphasis on the participation of young scientists and students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. For many, this meeting is their first opportunity to attend a major international conference and present their research findings; such presentations are a critical part of scientists' training and professional development. Funds from this award will help defray the participation costs for students, postdoctoral researchers, and young scientists for whom these costs would otherwise be a hardship. Special emphasis will be placed on supporting women and other researchers who belong to groups underrepresented in this field of research. Funds will be distributed to successful financial aid applicants on the basis of need."

Different from nanoconfined ferroelectric ceramic particles, confined ferroelectric polymers may not exhibit the so-called quantum confinement effect. Instead, their long chain nature and conformational flexibility results in rich and competing ferroelectric polymorphism, when the confinement size gradually decreases from micro- to nano-scales and confinement geometry changes from one-dimensional to two-dimensional, and finally to three-dimensional. In particular, the long-range cooperative interactions among dipoles will be broken or weakened in otherwise normal ferroelectric materials. Both chemical and physical confinement methods will be employed in this project. If successful, this proposed research will contribute to the advancement of fundamental polymer science and education in the field of ferroelectric polymers; 1) Nanoconfined polymer ferroelectricity is a novel concept which has seldom been studied in the polymer field before. 2) This research will lead to new properties and applications for ferroelectric polymers.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Potential impacts of this project are three folds. First, confined polymer ferroelectricity will have a broader impact on electrical energy storage applications, such as high energy density capacitors. Second, through this project, students at all levels, including the undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs, will be well trained for emerging energy-related professional careers. To reach this goal, the PI will recruit undergraduate and REU students, especially underrepresented students, into his research lab. To expose them to the nanoscience of ferroelectric and crystalline polymers, a graduate course, Polymer Structure and Morphology, will be taught with new contents of results from this proposed work. In addition, the PI will also focus on K-12 education by establishing collaborations with local high school science teachers via summer research projects. Interested high school students will also be recruited to stimulate and strengthen their general interest in science and engineering. Finally, research results will be broadly disseminated by collaborations with national laboratories and industries, as well as by publications in quality peer-reviewed journals and presentations at national and international meetings."

The analysis and modeling of the data is expected to provide an assessment of the mobility of e-h pairs in a given host, as well as the degree to which absorbed energy is lost at the particle surface. These measurements are also able to distinguish bulk energy loss effects from those involving migration to the surface. Such differentiation is important to the development of efficient nanoscale optical materials that have an intrinsically high surface area.

The project will also provide rich educational and research opportunities to engage students and educators in the Philadelphia area and in the larger community. In particular, the University of Puerto Rico-Humacao will benefit by gaining internet access to some measurement instruments in the Penn laboratory.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS:<br/>This project will investigate nanograin BaTiO3 ceramics for possible dielectric, ferroelectric and piezoelectric applications. By varying the grain size, grain boundary charge and crystal stability of the nanograin ceramics, it will seek to engineer a tunable nanocomposite without apparent compositional inhomogeneity. The composite effect will rely on charge/defect-induced internal fields to smear structural transitions and clamp polarization, creating stable dielectrics with temperature-independent dielectric responses. Such possibility was not previously available in conventional ceramics because until the advent of nanomaterials, the width of the space charge zone has been much less than the grain size. The project will take advantage of a recent breakthrough in sintering technology that allows densification without grain growth, which avails nanograin BaTiO3 ceramics.

Broadband dielectric spectroscopy, a powerful but surprisingly underutilized technique, will be used as the experimental probe of the dynamics over a broad range of temperatures and frequencies. An understanding of molecular mobility of polymeric materials in the deformed state is critical to their successful application in films, oriented tapes, and fibers. Nevertheless, there have been only a modest number of previous investigations of mechanical deformation on polymer dynamics, and very few using broadband dielectric spectroscopy.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this study is to develop basic insight into the role of uniaxial deformation on the dynamics of selected crosslinked and thermoplastic elastomers, as well as selected semi-crystalline polymers. In order to do so in a comprehensive fashion, it is critical that molecular orientation and structural changes accompanying deformation be thoroughly characterized. For elastomers, molecular level interpretations will be developed, in light of the experimentally measured orientation function and any strain-induced crystallization. To develop a detailed understanding of the observed relaxation behavior of deformed semi-crystalline polymers, the significant microstructural changes accompanying deformation must be characterized. Microstructural changes and molecular orientation will be followed experimentally using a variety of methods, including wide- and small-angle X-ray scattering techniques.<br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This project concerns the fundamental investigation of changes in molecular mobility as polymer systems are deformed, of critical importance to the production and successful industrial application of polymer films, coatings and fibers. A powerful but surprisingly underutilized technique, broadband dielectric spectroscopy, will be used to measure changes in molecular motions at various degrees of stretching. Together with findings from other experimental methods, molecular-level interpretations will be developed, facilitating the tailoring of these materials for advanced applications.<br/><br/>The research program will create new learning opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as a post-doctoral fellow. Undergraduate students will participate through a senior capstone project, as well as through an NSF supported REU program at Penn State. All participants will continue to engage in outreach activities, particularly those connected with Penn State?s Women In Science and Engineering Institute grade 6 ? 12 educational experiences."

Hayden, will undertake research on how ethnic identity develops when ethnic groups are internally and externally fragmented. The focus of her research will be a case study of Bulgarian Turks. With the creation of the Ottoman-Bulgaria border in 1878, the Turkish population in Bulgaria took on a multifacted identity, divided not only by the border, but also, in both countries, by internal hierarchical divisions along religious lines (Alevi Muslim versus Sunni Muslim) and regional lines (whether they originated in northern or southern Bulgaria). The complexity of the situation of Bulgarian Turks provides an ideal opportunity for refining social science understanding of ethnic groups and boundaries.<br/><br/>The researcher will investigate multiple aspects of the situation of Bulgarian Turks: How do members of a minority's different subgroups accommodate their disadvantages vis-à-vis other subgroups and in the broader society? Does it help or hinder them to maintain relations across borders and divisions? When, how, and why have members of some subgroups realized these connections while others did not? She will conduct archival research in Bulgaria and Turkey, and undertake ethnographic fieldwork, including participant observation and focused interviewing among Bulgarian Turks in two sites in Bulgaria (Razgrad and Kardjali) and one site Turkey (Bursa).<br/><br/>Governments often develop policies that are based on the assumption of homogeneity within minority populations. This research will test those assumptions and, in so doing, contribute to better social science theory of ethnic differentiation and the effects of borders, as well as better policy for minorities.

This project is focused on issues of boundary geometry and analysis which are fundamental in nature. In particular, the study of the Leray transform and related matters has substantial connections with the Laplace transform, an important tool in the study of partial differential equations. The project borrows from (and, it is hoped, will contribute to) a variety of geometric theories of independent interest. Finally, the project will involve work with younger investigators and thus will help to ensure that expertise in this area is available in the future."

The program to introduce these academics to the materials discipline consists of coupling traditional and non-traditional classes during the mornings with a combination of laboratory experiments and visits to industrial materials plants during the afternoons in a Gordon Conference style program setting. A typical day might begin with a traditional lecture in the morning, followed by a group cooperative learning session with computer involvement to develop computer assisted learning skills. Afternoons will alternate between hands-on laboratory activities and industrial facility visits. For example, within a few minutes by car of the University of Alabama campus are Nucor Steel (metals), Radici Spandex (polymers) and Lafarge Cement (ceramics). Approximately 30 faculty from the nation?s 114 HBCU?s will be invited to participate in the program each year. To further develop a long-term relationship with some of the institutions, a research component was developed. This research component consists of inviting two former participants who participated in one of the previous programs for a 6-10 week summer research opportunity. The HBCU faculty will be teamed with a University of Alabama faculty member to work on a materials-related research project. This program will provide faculty members and educators from HBCU?s with a thorough introduction to the materials science and engineering discipline and the instruments needed to develop materials science based examples and/or experiments to convey the importance of materials and their relationship to the basic principles in mathematics and the physical sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, astronomy, etc.). <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Although almost everything we encounter on a daily basis is composed of either glass, ceramics, metals, polymers (plastics), or a composite structure, the well established discipline of Materials Science and Engineering is relatively unknown compared to other engineering disciplines. The field of Materials Science and Engineering remains a hidden opportunity for many of today?s students. This situation exists at many major universities which do not have a focused materials department and even at some institutions where minor materials activities exist within other departments. Only at those institutions where strong materials departments exist are the students cognizant of the field of materials and its career opportunities. At most Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU?s), the discipline of Materials Science and Engineering is practically unknown at the undergraduate level. To address this void, a program was developed at The University of Alabama by Drs. Viola L. Acoff and Mark L. Weaver to introduce science faculty from HBCU?s to the field of Materials Science and Engineering. The 3-week program consists of coupling traditional and non-traditional classes during the mornings with a combination of laboratory experiments and visits to industrial materials plants during the afternoons. To further develop a long-term relationship with some of the institutions, two former participants who participated in one of the previous 3-week programs will be invited back for a 6-10 week summer research opportunity. The HBCU faculty will be teamed with a University of Alabama faculty member to work on a materials-related research project. The attending HBCU faculty will gain knowledge of materials, obtain an appreciation for the materials discipline and leave with the ?tools? to familiarize their students with the discipline of materials. This study has the potential to impact the field of materials science by increasing the diversity of the discipline."

The alternating copolymerization of substituted stilbenes and maleic anhydride or N-substituted maleimides will be studied as a new route to synthesize macromolecules with precise control of the placement and density of functional groups along the polymer backbone. The incorporation of the sterically crowded 1,2-diphenylethane units, in conjunction with the five member cyclic imide or anhydride units, results in structures that are anticipated to be considerably stiffened when compared to less constrained polymer chains. Synthetic targets of this research will include new sterically crowded polyanions and polycations with a regular variation of charge densities along the chain enabled by the alternating copolymerization of specifically designed and prepared functional stilbenes and maleimide comonomers. The consequences of the sterically constrained backbones and placement of functional groups on fundamental properties such as persistence length and solution rheological properties will be studied. Solid state NMR will be used to study the enchainment stereochemistry of the maleic anhydride and maleimide comonomers. The stiffened polyanions and polycations will be compared to polyzwitterionic structures with similar chain backbones. These new polyelectrolytes and polyzwitterions will be enchained into double hydrophilic block copolymers (DHBC) by controlled free radical polymerization techniques. These DHBC structures will be used to assist in establishing structure property relationships that govern the ?like-charge? attraction observed in DNA and more recently reported from the PI?s laboratory in a synthetic DHBC derived from a substituted stilbene-alt-maleic anhydride zwitterionic copolymer.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>New precisely functionalized polymeric materials, based on easily scaleable and industrially practiced free radical polymerization chemistries have significant potential to have practical impact across a broad range of advanced technology frontiers. The fundamental research described in this proposal could foster a new polymer platform which has the potential to be used to produce new porous and high surface area network materials for hydrogen storage, new rigid polyelectrolytes for control of flow in aqueous fluids, new polyelectrolyte gels which could be applied in membranes, and new nano-particle stabilization agents. In addition the synthesis and study of new rod-coil aqueous block copolymers, derived from the new polymers of this study, will provide fundamental biomimetic information that can have impact in various biomedical applications such as therapeutic delivery. Active participation in the research project will require graduate students to master modern polymerization and synthetic chemistries and to interact with other scientists and engineers in a strong interdisciplinary mode in order to fully characterize and understand the properties of these new polymeric materials. The graduate students involved with this research will interact with industrial researchers in Virginia Tech polymer short courses and will mentor summer undergraduate students in the Macromolecules and Interfaces Institute?s NSF REU program. This specific training will be valuable for initiating viable careers for these researchers in a variety of industrial and academic areas important for sustaining and growing the nation?s science and technology enterprise."

Hydrogen-bonded frameworks based on the two-dimensional guanidinium-sulfonate (GS) sheet, however, have proven to be a benchmark in ?crystal engineering? owing to their structural robustness, which permits facile interchange of molecular constituents in selected framework architectures that often can be predicted and controlled through straightforward empirical principles. The versatility of the GS system will be exploited for (i) the synthesis of new class of GS hosts derived from a library of calixarene tetrasulfonates that form molecular baskets, suspended from the GS sheet, capable of including guest molecules within the calixarene rather than within the gallery regions between opposing GS sheets, (ii) examination of the hydrogen sorption characteristics of various guanidinium calixarenetetrasulfonates, (iii) the exploration of ferroelectric behavior associated with polar guests embedded within the suspended calixarenes, (iv) GS channel inclusion compounds with laser dyes as guests, aimed at regulating of the aggregation states of the dyes and their corresponding emission characteristics, (v) GS channel inclusion compounds with organic nitroxide guests, aimed at unraveling structure-property relationships in a new class of molecular magnets, (vi) enantioselective inclusion by chiral organomonosulfonate hosts, (vii) synthesis of discrete molecular capsules based on complementary hydrogen-bonding spacers between opposing calixarene units.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project aims to capitalize on molecules that can be used as ?tinkertoys? to construct designer materials with optical, electronic, magnetic and storage properties that can be tuned systematically through swapping of the molecular components, which is difficult to achieve through more conventional routes. As such, these materials have to potential to impact several U.S. technologies, including data storage, communications, energy, health, and specialty chemicals, including pharmaceutical materials. Additionally, the project will provide education and research training in STEM while cultivating the next generation of scientists and engineers through (i) summer research experiences for undergraduates and faculty from minority-serving and four-year institutions through connections to the NYU Materials Research Science and Engineering Center and a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site, (ii) research experiences for high school students from various NYC schools, including the Spence School, and all-girls K-12 institution in NYC, (iii) development of courses for high school teachers enrolled in the NYU Chemistry Masters of Science for High School Educators program, thus enhancing science education in the largest and most diverse school system in the U.S., (iv) offer professional development of student and postdocs through the creation of a Northeast Solid State Chemistry Symposium that will elevate their skills and confidence in scientific presentations, (vi) expose graduate students and postdocs to scientists from industrial laboratories and other academic institutions, U.S. and international through direct research collaborations."

Most of the problems are within ergodic theory and are related to the analysis of the long-term behavior of systems whose dynamics are too complicated or too chaotic to be understood locally. The research component of the project builds on the principal investigator's results of the past few years in multiple recurrence and convergence and, in particular, on the new unerstanding these results have provided on the role of certain systems (nilsystems) in the analysis. This area of ergodic theory has strong relations to problems in additive combinatorics and harmonic analysis. The project will continue to explore these deep links, developing the applications of ergodic theory to such areas.<br/><br/>The outreach portion of the project involves conference organization, mentoring, advising, and development of new courses. The principal investigator has been actively involved in education of researchers in fields with links to ergodic theory and will continue to do so, primarily by organizing interdisciplinary meetings. Ergodic theory is an area of mathematics in which probability and dynamical systems meet. As such, it is relevant to the mathematical modeling of many phenomena that arise in the physical sciences, engineering, and economics."

The host institutions for this research are Cornell University and Simon Fraser University and the sponsoring scientists are Profs. Stephen Ellner and Bernard Roitberg, respectively.<br/><br/>Population dynamics can be influenced by ""adaptive evolution"", or the process that allows populations to become better suited to their environment. However, the explicit incorporation of adaptive evolution is often ignored in populations dynamics models because the timescale at which evolutionary change occurs is considered to be beyond the scope of our lifetimes, or ""ecological time"". The research combines the use of computational techniques and a long-term data set collected on a leaf-mining moth called the Tupelo Leafminer (Antispila nysaefoliella), which is parasitized by numerous species. The resulting models will indicate if the Tupelo Leafminer is evolving in response to the presence of parasitoids.<br/><br/>The training objectives include theoretical modeling, integration of general principles of evolutionary and ecology theory, and application of a rich data set from an insect population. The broader impact of the modeling will help the general public to understand the importance of adaptation in structuring natural communities and lead to the design of safe and effective biological control methods for pest management. Educational impacts include training for the Fellow who will mentor women and minority students through the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates and local programs that focus on ecological sustainability."

Part of the challenge in designing silicon integrated circuits that can meet this demand is to overcome limitations in the efficiency and frequency bandwidth of modern transistors. Here it is proposed to use two-dimensional networks of inductors and capacitors to overcome these limitations. These high-speed, high-efficiency networks have a cut-off frequency that is higher than that for silicon-based transistors. Moreover, such networks can be incorporated into standard silicon chips that can be fabricated at low cost. The proposed research has the potential to revolutionize high-frequency analog signal processing, leading to chips that operate up to 1000 times faster than current ones.<br/><br/>There are a large number of possible designs for such networks, and only a small number of these possibilities have already been explored. The proposed research seeks to develop algorithms that greatly assist in the simulation and design of two-dimensional inductor-capacitor networks. Simulating a large network involves the solution of a large, coupled system of equations that can be simplified greatly through mathematical analysis. It is proposed to use this simplification to develop fast, scalable algorithms and codes for network simulation. This would enable engineers to quickly learn the effect of changing one or more of the thousands of parameters in a typical large-scale inductor-capacitor network.<br/><br/>It is also proposed to use optimization methods to automatically design lattices that achieve prescribed input-output relationships. The optimization work will use as a foundation the prior results of the proposers, including, for example, the development of a two-dimensional network that computes Fourier transforms in the analog domain. Such physically motivated ideas will be coupled with modern tools of parallel numerical computing such as PetSC (the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) and TAO (the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization). This will result in fast, accurate tools that enable engineers to rapidly optimize the design of a lattice to achieve desired performance specifications.<br/><br/>The expertise gained in carrying out the proposed research will enable the investigators to train students and researchers to solve problems in modern computational science and engineering. The proposed research encourages multidisciplinary interaction between scientists, engineers, applied mathematicians, and computer scientists spanning the spectrum from developers to users of computational tools."

This proposal seeks funding for measurement of the cosmogenic radionuclides 26Al and 10Be in quartz from core and outcrop of Plio-Pleistocene sediment within and near Unaweep Canyon. The Plio-Pleistocene sediments were newly mapped in 2003-2006, and the core was collected in 2004. Our preliminary data indicate that Unaweep Canyon is a Paleozoic landform buried by later Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments and then re-exhumed during the Cenozoic, a controversial claim. Despite considerable age-dating efforts in our previous research, we have found no material in this sedimentary succession that can be dated using conventional methods. Thus, the purpose of this proposal is to apply newly developed methods of ?burial dating? based on the production and decay of cosmic-ray-produced radionuclides to determine the age of the sediments from the newly acquired core and the newly mapped outcrops. <br/>Successful dating of the target sediments will yield three tangible benefits. First, it will solve a significant regional geologic problem by establishing the timeline of geomorphic events and will yield insight into the rate and nature of Cenozoic fluvial incision of the Colorado Plateau?a long-standing problem. Second, it will help to move a newly developed dating method from the developmental stage into practical applications. Third, the borehole penetrates ~ 150 meters of lacustrine sediments believed to be of middle Pleistocene age, thus offering the potential to access an extremely valuable record of Pleistocene paleoclimate and paleoenvironment. This work will also result in significant broader impacts, including strengthening interdisciplinary collaborations, exposing students to cutting-edge techniques, and disseminating the research via publication and classroom use. This project is ?high risk-high payoff? because it involves application of new expertise, but offers potential for great dividends in terms of research advances in geomorphology and paleoclimate."

This study will benefit from new developments demonstrating that direct x-ray phase retrieval methods can non-destructively probe the 3D structure, chemical and strain distributions of epitaxial quantum dots. The plan is to apply Coherent Bragg Rod Analysis (COBRA) mapping techniques to a variety of quantum dot systems, including self-assembly by Stransky-Krastanov growth and droplet epitaxy, as well as novel site directed assembly methods. In-depth x-ray synchrotron studies of patterned dot arrays will be achieved by Focused Ion Beam patterning as well as nanostructure growth on patterned templates made by electron-beam lithography.

The genetics of frog immunity will be critical to understanding the dynamics and potential outcome of this disease for amphibian biodiversity. This study investigates the genetic consequences of infection by the chytridiomycosis-causing pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in the lowland leopard frog, Rana yavapaiensis. The researchers propose to characterize disease prevalence across frog populations with different histories to determine the relationship between infection and disease, and to test for associations between chytridiomycosis susceptibility and frog genetic background in natural populations and in lab-reared individuals. Frog and Bd samples will be collected from genetically-distinct Arizona frog populations for five years, and tadpoles will be reared from five focal localities for experimental infections in the laboratory. Using each frog's infection and disease status along with genotypes at neutral (microsatellite) genetic markers and immunogenetic (major histocompatibility complex) genes, this study will test hypotheses about immunogenetics, disease susceptibility, and disease dynamics.<br/><br/>Understanding the relationship between Bd infection and frog mortality, the importance of standing immunogenetic variation for population disease dynamics, and the effect of host genotype on disease outcome, will provide critical genetic indices for future studies of amphibian chytridiomycosis and other emerging wildlife diseases. One graduate student and several undergraduate students will receive broad training through participation in this project."

As a consequence, plants have evolved a wide array of defenses to protect themselves from being eaten. However, the production of plant defenses is costly. Plants are constrained in how they can allocate their resources throughout plant development (i.e. ontogeny) to various essential functions, including defense. While recent studies have demonstrated that plant ontogeny can affect the expression of numerous traits relevant to herbivores, such as nutritional content and physical and chemical defenses, less attention has been given to investigating potential indirect effects of this variation on consumer species. The aim of this project is to assess how variation in plant traits, such as nutritional value, size, and chemical and physical defenses, throughout the ontogeny of a host-plant (Plantago lanceolata), can modify its interactions with a specialist herbivore (Buckeye butterfly, Junonia coenia) and predators of that herbivore. The investigators will conduct three greenhouse and field experiments examining where butterflies choose to lay their eggs, caterpillar performance and caterpillar predation risk at four host plant developmental stages. This research will document potential ecological and evolutionary consequences of temporal variation in plant traits on plant-herbivore-predator dynamics. This knowledge is important for both agricultural systems and conservation biology. Being able to predict herbivore host selection, performance, and predation risk on different host plant developmental stages will help to improve pest management strategies for crops, as well as to develop better eradication plans for invasive plant species. Several undergraduates will be trained in ecological research methods in this study, and the researchers will conduct public outreach to K-12 students and teachers through established relationships with University of Colorado educational programs."

There are four main objectives of this work:<br/>First, free radical polymerization will be used to establish the relationship between the initiator density, polymer grafting density, molecular weight, and polydispersity index. Substrates with independently varied orthogonal gradients in polymer grafting density and molecular weight will be fabricated comprising polymers grown from substrate-bound initiators. The amount of activated vs. non-activated initiator sites and polymer grafting density and molecular weight of the grafts will be quantified by means of surface-sensitive analytical techniques. Second, azo-based initiator system will be employed to monitor the characteristics of polymer brushes grown via reverse atom transfer radical polymerization. While this transformation has been studied in bulk, it has never been performed in ?grafting from? polymerizations. Expected differences in polydispersity index and polymerization kinetics will be expedited through use of polymer grafting density/molecular weight orthogonal gradients at varying temperatures and transition metal salt concentrations. Third, the ability to UV-activate the azo-initiators will be exploited to form substrate-bound micrometer-sized macromolecular gradients. By utilizing microfluidic reactors microscale polymer patterning will be accomplished by locally intermixing two monomer streams along the microfluidic channel and by employing UV irradiation through photomasks. Fourth, as a seed project, microwave-induced free radical polymerization will be utilized to provide local substrate heating in order to de-couple the kinetics of propagation from the initiation step, which heretofore has not been possible, by concurrently cooling the monomer solution and heating the substrate locally by microwave.<br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>The relationship between surface initiator density and grafted polymer density, which has never been investigated in a systematic way before, is of critical importance when considering the breadth and depth of applications of polymer brushes. While advanced materials have high value, economics limit their use, strictly confining them to those areas where they are absolutely necessary. To this end it is advantageous, from both cost and performance standpoint, to fabricate thin chemically and structurally tailored coatings that can be applied to various surfaces. By doing so, one can attain full control over the interface between the original substrate and its surroundings with just a few nm of engineered coating material. Applications of these polymeric structures range from preparing chemically and structurally tailored films preventing fouling of ships to controlling biomaterial interfaces in vivo, as well as countless other technological applications, including (but not limited to), lubrication, anti-flocculation, particle assembly, protein adsorption, cell signaling, and nanoscale molecular motion. Our outreach and education efforts, which complement the scientific aspect of the work, include: i) training graduate students, ii) outreach activities in an elementary school in Ararat, VA, and iii) attracting local K-12 teachers and students to take part in our interdisciplinary research endeavors through the Kenan Fellows and the Science House programs at NC State University, and iv) organizing national and international scientific meetings for undergraduate and graduate students at NC State University."

Arachnids are among the most diverse organisms in caves and are a primary conservation concern in Texas where eleven species are listed under the Endangered Species Act. Unfortunately, the taxonomy for these groups is outdated and prevents an accurate assessment of conservation priority. Recent advances in systematic biology provide new tools that can be used by taxonomists to help resolve these difficulties and provide insight into the evolution of cave organisms.<br/><br/>This project is focused on Neoleptoneta, a diverse group of spiders restricted to caves and soil habitats in Southwestern North America where two species, Neoleptoneta microps and N. myopica, are federally recognized as endangered. Preliminary data show that several species, including the endangered Neoleptoneta myopica, are more broadly distributed than believed and suggest that caves are linked into larger subterranean networks. A combination of morphological, molecular, and geological evidence will be used to refine the species limits within Neoleptoneta and ascertain the degree of connectivity between caves. The study will contribute to a better understanding of the biogeography and conservation of cave invertebrates in Texas and test fundamental assumptions about the evolution of cave life.

This will be a hands-on short course with lectures followed by computer exercises designed to reinforce the concepts being taught. Some exercises will use local computers, but many of the exercises will utilize high performance computing machines that are part of the NSF sponsored teragrid consortium. Students will complete a design concept project at the conclusion of the workshop. They will be required to attempt to implement their design after the workshop and present the results in the fall of 2009 in a webinar.

The aim is to enhance current understanding of the properties of nanomaterials by: 1) investigating a mild technique for purification of SWNTs, 2) investigating the electrical applications of SWNT networks, and 3) studying the effect of SWNT density on electrochemical response. The SWNT deposition method involves formation of electrically continuous SWNT arrays from aqueous suspensions. A major advantage is expected since solution deposition processes decouple the growth process (which occurs at ~800C) from the deposition process (which occurs at room temperature). This allows purification of the material to remove residual impurities, as well as the use of heat sensitive substrates, presenting an increased area of potential applications. <br/>Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance.

Both the costs and the benefits, however, are uncertain. To date, models used in studies of climate change have not represented all the critical uncertainties. One important omission is the representation of uncertainty in returns to research and development (R&D) directed to the improvement of energy technologies. Studies on R&D have shown that such returns are uncertain and highly skewed (i.e., have a small probability of a very large breakthrough). Ignoring this uncertainty and focusing on the average effect will produce biased estimates of the emissions reductions required to meet particular targets or the relative balance between near-term emissions constraints and investments in energy technology R&D. <br/><br/>This research will improve the analysis tools available to decision makers by developing a model framework that explicitly represents the uncertainty in the returns to R&D. The representation of technical change and its relation to R&D expenditure will be calibrated to historical experience with U.S. patents. The model will also improve the representation of the uncertainty in the climate response to greenhouse gas emissions by constraining that uncertainty to a range consistent with 20th century climate. These components will be integrated into a single framework that can be used to explore decision making about emissions reductions and R&D expenditures under uncertainty. <br/><br/>The results of this research will improve the analysis facilities that are applied to climate change assessment. The new tools are expected to give improved guidance in the timing of emissions reductions and investments in technology R&D by eliminating biases in current models."

Wigginton to work with Dr. Tamar Kohn at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland.<br/><br/>Solar disinfection is an effective, low-cost, and sustainable treatment option for the removal of pathogens from wastewaters and drinking waters. For sunlit waters, the inactivation of microbial contaminants can occur by a direct and an indirect mechanism. In clear water, direct damage of the organism?s nucleic acid occurs by UVB light. In highly colored waters, like those typical of waste stabilization ponds (WSPs), UVB light extends only through the top layer of the photic zone. As a result, direct inactivation of microbial contaminants in WSPs is only significant in a thin layer near the surface of the ponds. UVA and visible light, on the other hand, can penetrate further into the photic zone and initiate indirect photo-inactivation. When oxygen is present, the photoexcitation of sensitizers present either within the microbe (e.g., porphyrins, certain amino acids) or in the water column can lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen (1O2), hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, etc. These species can subsequently react with cell constituents of the pathogens and lead to their inactivation. <br/>Despite the widespread use of solar disinfection, there is still little known regarding the reactions that occur between ROS and microbial contaminants in surface waters. As a result, drinking water and wastewater engineers are limited in their ability to predict and optimize the efficiency of solar virus disinfection. Previous work by Kohn, et al. examined the inactivation of bacteriophage MS2, a commonly used surrogate for human viruses, with solar treatment in the presence of natural occurring sensitizing materials. The results demonstrated that singlet oxygen (1O2) was the most important process in MS2 inactivation under these conditions. More recent work by Dr. Kohn?s group has shown that after several logs of MS2 inactivation by 1O2, the viral RNA inside the MS2 capsid is mostly preserved. This suggests that photoinactivation of MS2 via 1O2 occurs from modifications on the viral capsid proteins and is not due to oxidation of the genomic material. <br/>The aim of this research is to identify sites of photooxidation on viral capsids, characterize the reaction mechanisms with ROS, and determine which oxidation sites are responsible for virus inactivation. Specifically, MS2 bacteriophage and poliovirus type 3 are treated with 1O2 and inactivation is monitored with standard plating methods. Alterations in capsid proteins are identified and monitored using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). MALDI-MS and ESI-MS/MS have become critical tools in virology studies and have been previously used to study the structure of virus proteins as well as entire viruses. To the PI?s knowledge, this is the first time MS techniques have been used to study the oxidation of virus proteins. <br/>Concurrent with the mass spectral analyses, protein capsid photooxidation is examined with surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). SERS spectra of live and inactivated virus are combined with multivariate statistical tools and ultimately, the PI seeks to use these techniques to develop a predictive tool for measuring virus viability.<br/>To confirm that the observed results occur in real waters, parallel experiments in waste stabilization pond samples will be conducted. The results from real waters will be compared with the laboratory water experiment results. Additionally, inactivation pathways of the two studied virus types will be compared and then used to predict 1O2 inactivation pathways and kinetics for a number of waterborne human viruses."

The principal focus of the project is the interplay between geometry and probability. One of the goals of the research is to refine our understanding of the distributions of zeros and critical points of polynomials, holomorphic sections of ample line bundles, and entire functions. A fundamental ingredient in the study of random sections is the Bergman-Szego kernel, and this project involves an examination of the asymptotics of this kernel for large powers of the line bundle. Shiffman will investigate asymptotic statistics for polynomials of increasing degree, holomorphic sections of increasing powers of a line bundle, or in the case of entire functions, on domains of increasing size. One problem is to estimate ""hole probabilities"" and ""overcrowding probabilities"" (i.e., the probabilities that random systems of equations have no solutions or too many solutions in fixed domains). Shiffman will also study the distribution of zeros of real and complex ""fewnomial"" systems--polynomials of high degree with few terms. He will also investigate the asymptotic distribution of critical points for spherical harmonics as the dimension increases.<br/><br/>The distribution of critical points and zeros of random functions is relevant to many areas in physics, signal and image processing, and other areas of engineering. In the physical sciences it is often necessary to handle disorder, where a certain amount of randomness is inserted into a system. Random polynomials provide an elementary model for many systems, such as systems of atoms and molecules and their component particles--protons, neutrons, and electrons. Quantum mechanics describes these particles by wave functions, which are solutions of Schrodinger's equation. The zeros and local maxima of wave functions give important information on states of atoms and molecules; the zeros are known in quantum chemistry and physics as nodal lines. Polynomials in several variables correspond to systems with several degrees of freedom, and those polynomials of high degree correspond to wave functions for highly excited states. While Shiffman's recent research was concerned primarily with demonstrating that average states of such large systems are typical, as in the law of large numbers, this project will also include the study of ""rare events,"" which has applications to various areas of current interest, such as economics and the study of climatic extremes."

In addition to clinical applications, the device may also be a valuable tool for basic biomedical research, particularly for those involving serial in vivo animal model studies. <br/><br/>The primary objective of the research plan is to develop a miniature, forward-looking, multi-modality optical imaging device that can be delivered endoscopically for examining internal organs at or near cellular resolution. The endoscope can be used with optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal microscopy and potentially multiphoton (fluorescence) microscopy (MPM), to perform non-invasive ""optical biopsy."" The year-by-year specific plans are to: (1) develop the essential components for a scanning endoscope, including a miniature fiber-optic beam scanner and high performance achromatic micro optics; (2) explore a novel real-time focus-tracking mechanism using an ultrasonic micromotor; (3) develop a new beam-scanning scheme that enables real-time ultrahigh resolution OCT imaging with an ultra broadband light source, and study real-time en face confocal imaging with the miniature scanning endoscope; (4) investigate the feasibility of the scanning endoscope for assessing cancerous changes using a carcinogenesis animal model; and (5) further miniaturize the scanning endoscope to interface with conventional surface tissue endoscopes, and explore the feasibility of the scanning endoscope for MPM imaging. In addition to clinical applications, the proposed device can also be a valuable tool for basic biomedical research, particularly for those involving serial in vivo animal model studies. <br/><br/>The central aim of the education plan is to create a strong biomedical imaging and biophotonics research and education program, which vertically integrates physics, engineering and clinical diagnosis applications.

Humans have the capacity to both recognize tools and comprehend how they are used to achieve a behavioral goal. However, many people suffer from disorders related to the failure in integrating cognitive and motor processes, particularly after brain injury. The two well studied deficits in this regard are apraxia, impairment in goal-directed movement, and agnosia, impairment in object recognition. Currently, researchers tend to treat apraxia and agnosia as separate phenomena, and they build separate theories to account for them. A better understanding is possible if researchers consider the many similarities in agnosia and apraxia, as there is much that can be learned from more collaborative work in the two domains. An immediate goal of this workshop is to foster communication between researchers who study apraxia and agnosia by 1) encouraging and developing collaboration between the two fields, and 2) promoting research that integrates concepts and accounts from both fields, and 3) identifying the neural substrates of impairment and recovery that may underlie both apraxia and agnosia. <br/><br/>The understanding of the target questions of the workshop will have significant implications for both basic science and public health. Apraxia and agnosia have debilitating effects on patients in their daily lives, and these deficits require the joint efforts from researchers in neuropsychology, neuroscience, and kinesthetic sciences. The proposed workshop has a highly interdisciplinary nature and is likely to promote new and existing collaborations. The funding will bring international experts to the meeting, and enable students and postdocs to participate in the meeting by including reduced fees and opportunities for travel support. The speakers and the organizing committee include women and members of underrepresented minorities. Finally, a critical outcome of the workshop is to develop collaborative clusters to advance the field in both basic neuroscience and clinical applications."

The volcano being investigated is one in which there is an unusual high-intensity hydrothermal plume and explosively erupted volcanic material. Goals of this work are to document the fauna that colonize the initial stages of back arc volcanism, as well as to sample early stage hydrothermal fluids. The intensity of fluid flow from the vents will also be examined. It is likely that novel and previously unknown microbiological life forms associated with these fluids will be discovered. Work is complementary to data being gathered to the south in an area of intense NSF-funded work (the Ridge 2000 Program). Broader impacts of the work include graduate student and postdoctoral training, support of a PI whose gender is under-represented in the sciences, use of a novel ROV for undersea exploration, and public outreach through media outlets.

Within this context of neoliberalism, market-based regulatory schemes and third-party certifications - many with an explicitly environmental focus - have become prominent. In particular, global agrofood markets are now policed by a variety of organic standards and certifiers, retailer-driven certifications, voluntary best-practice standards, and other non-governmental regulatory schemes. These standards are highly variable in their structures, levels of compliance, and market recognition, as well as their impacts on everyday environmental management of farms. Through an extended case study of the extremely neoliberal and globalized New Zealand dairy industry, this dissertation seeks to extend existing theories of roll-out neoliberalization, reregulation, and the corporate environmental food regime to address the variation of these private regulatory schemes. The co-PI will spend twelve months doing field work throughout New Zealand and conduct in-depth semi-structured interviews with a three-wave stratified sample of farmers as well as dairy processors and certification agents. This original qualitative data will be combined with an existing representative longitudinal survey of New Zealand dairy producers. These data will be used to answer four research questions: 1) how do producers and processors decide in which private regulatory schemes to participate? 2) how do producers and processors decide which environmental management practices to use? 3) how do producers and processors experience enforcement of private regulatory schemes? 4) what is the level of compliance with the preferred environmental management practices of private regulatory schemes? By asking producers and processors to articulate their lived experiences across several different private regulatory standards, this dissertation seeks to explain significant processes at both the producer and regulation level.<br/><br/>Recent public health scares such as spinach contaminated with E. Coli and milk powders contaminated with toxic Melamine have led to growing concern about the state of the global agrofood system and the role of government and private regulation. This massive public health crisis and failure of the agrofood system has led to justifiable calls for closer regulation and policing of the production and processing of milk products. Within the context of free-market ideology and neoliberalism now dominating the global political economy, the possibility of market-based standards and certifications has been at the center of much of the public discussion of the crisis. Beyond the agrofood system, private standards such as ""fair trade"" and ""carbon-neutral"" certifications are playing an increasing role in the marketplace. While retailers and consumers have largely embraced these non-government forms of regulation, relatively little is known about the social realities of private regulations. By analyzing the lived experience of a variety of private regulatory schemes as well as compliance with those certifications, this research can provide critical insights into this growing form of regulation. The research holds relevance for actors from a variety of different social positions including activists, businesses and producers, consumers, and government representatives."

Yet the controls on phosphorus cycling are not well understood, and these controls are expected to change with global climate change and continued land-use conversion. Understanding phosphorus cycling in the lowland tropics is especially critical because many soils of this region have mineral constituents that greatly hinder the mobility of this nutrient. The goal of this study is to improve our understanding of how leaf litter leachate (water extracts of senesced leaves) affects phosphorus cycling in seasonal lowland tropical forests. This study will evaluate whether leaf litter leachate is important for the return of nutrients to the soil, and if leaching potential can be predicted from structural and chemical characteristics of litter. The researchers will also investigate the extent to which litter leachate controls phosphorus cycling within the plant-soil-microbe environment. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include its contribution to our understanding of the relationships between litter leaching and rainfall patterns, and the applications of these results for predicting and mitigating the effects of climate change. An improved understanding of how natural systems cycle phosphorus could also have applications for improving production in managed systems, without high inputs of fertilizer.

Her research will focus on the Ecuadorian Andes. The Andean region long has been a center of origin of agriculture, where farmers have domesticated and developed a wealth of varieties with distinct properties and genetic make-ups within a number of crop species. Over recent decades, this diversity has declined, in part because indigenous practices have been devalued and people have turned away from traditional foods. However, recently there have been radical shifts in political as well as social landscapes across the Andean region, sometimes referred to as ""reindigenization."" By recasting indigeneity in a more positive light, these developments provide a natural laboratory in which to better understand the relationship between social, cultural, and political processes and the maintenance of crop diversity. <br/><br/>The researcher will employ a mixture of social science research methods, including participant observation, archival research, focus group discussions, life history interviews, ethnobotanical collection, a seasonal interview survey, and comparison with a crop diversity data set collected in the study area six years earlier. These qualitative and quantitative data will allow her to assess whether the reindigenization process can be linked to changes over time in the symbolic values of food, food consumption patterns, and crop diversity. <br/><br/>This research is important because it will produce a detailed measurement of the region's crop diversity and how it has changed over the past six years. By also connecting this changing inventory to cultural and political changes, the research will advance social scientific understanding of the connections between the larger society, farmer management, and plant genetic resources. Thus the research will contribute to both local and global conservation and development efforts, as well as to the education of a graduate student."

The research approach consists of extending finite difference time domain methods to accurately model the strain-induced changes in resonant response of small inductor-capacitor loop structures to be mounted directly on the tool. This method will be used to identify the most strain sensitive structures followed by experimental verification that these structures can accurately measure cutting forces. When this is accomplished, the lateral and torsional forces will be dynamically measured during cutting to monitor cutting efficiency and quality as well as detect tool degradation and/or failure. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work are extending finite difference time domain methods so that they are applicable to the small structures present in all high frequency electronics and that it will transform the process of milling by providing a sensor system for closed-loop control of machining where none having these capabilities currently exists. Having closed-loop control will enable the development of smart machine tool architectures which will have a dramatic impact on the productivity of the milling process while simultaneously improving the quality of the finished parts. The ultimate goal is to make this system a standard component in high end machining systems, thereby transforming the metal removal process in milling."

A multiferroic is a material that exhibits two or more of the primary ferroic properties (ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity).  A composite of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials will allow coupling between magnetic and electric subsystems that is mediated by mechanical forces and is a magneto-electric (ME) multiferroic.  Such composites provide the opportunity for studies on the physics of ME coupling and have enormous potential for novel devices. This project will expand research on magneto-electric interactions to the new frontier of graded ferroics.  Recent studies on compositionally graded ferromagnets and ferroelectrics have discovered new phenomena including internal potentials, induced anisotropy, and spontaneous strains.  The planned efforts will involve the synthesis of functionally graded bilayers and multilayers of ferrites and ferroelectrics and studies on the effects of grading and the nature of ME interactions.  The grading will involve piezomagnetic coupling in ferrites and piezoelectric coefficient in ferroelectrics and will be accomplished by grading the chemical composition.  Studies on ME interactions will be done over 1 mHz ? 110 GHz including low-frequency effects and coupling at electromechanical, ferromagnetic and magnetoacoustic resonances. Postdoctoral research associates, graduate and undergraduate students and high school interns will participate in the research.  Collaboration with industry is also planned for technology transfer.<br/><br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This project is on composite materials that are capable of converting electrical energy to magnetic energy and have enormous potential for use in energy harvesting, energy storage and consumer electronics. The composite will have two components that respond individually to electric or magnetic field by producing a mechanical deformation. The project is aimed at tailoring properties of the two phases to accomplish improved mechanical response, and therefore, enhancement in the energy conversion efficiency.  Changes in the chemical composition of each phase in a controlled manner are the avenue that will be explored to achieve these goals. Individual phases and composites with composition variations will be synthesized and characterized in terms of properties of importance for energy conversion. Postdoctoral research associates, graduate and undergraduate students and high school interns will participate in the research. Collaboration with industry is also planned for technology transfer."

A secondary pulse injected into these wakes, depending on the injection delay, can either be trapped and steered or scattered out of the beam axis. These results promise to allow much higher filament laser power, greatly extended filament lengths, increased electron density, and enhanced filament continuity, all essential for applications of femtosecond filaments, including terahertz generation, remote ionization, nonlinear light generation and atmospheric monitoring, and channels for electrical discharges.

An additional goal is to enhance and accelerate the connection between numerical relativity and data analysis and build stronger ties to the general public through research. The interdisciplinary projects supported by this award, applying numerical relativity to astrophysics and data analysis, form an ideal ground for training the next generation of gravitational-wave physicists.

Over the past year, numerical relativity has begun to successfully solve Einstein's equations governing gravity for the strongest source of gravitational waves, the final few orbits and plunge of two black holes. Taken together with gravitational wave detection, these models probe the mysteries of general relativity by interpreting what nature is telling us about gravity.

Acoustic cloaking is in its infancy, and it is not even clear whether cloaking of elastic waves is possible. This project will address these questions through theory and simulation. The first goal is a thorough understanding of acoustic cloaks, focusing on so-called pentamode metamaterials. These are easily sheared, like rubber or water, but have the unusual property that they support a biaxial state of stress, as compared with hydrostatic. The main objective, elastodynamic cloaking, will first consider a metamaterial layer capable of emulating the wave properties of a thicker layer of normal solid. Mathematical relations involving coordinate and gauge transformations will be used, and more complicated cylindrical and spherical structures will be studied. The final goal is a realistic model of Rayleigh wave cloaking. <br/><br/>Longer term societal benefits will be enhanced technology for reducing vibration and noise, and methods to channel destructive mechanical wave energy around sensitive areas and objects, such as shielding buildings from earthquake ground motion. The project will include a seminar for honors engineering freshmen on the subject of metamaterials, cloaking, and futuristic technology. Undergraduates will be explicitly involved in the research, building on a current project for seniors. A web-page explaining cloaking in layperson terms will be enhanced."

Research has largely been devoted to the properties of linear-chain polymer systems; the influence of polymer chain architecture on the properties of thin films has largely remained unexplored. The goal of this proposal is to understand the effect of chain architecture on the miscibility, dynamics, glass transition and aging phenomena in thin film linear/star molecule and star/star molecule mixtures. There are several reasons for studying star polymers. Star molecules suffer a smaller loss in entropy than linear chains upon adsorption at interfaces. In additional to their interfacial properties, the dynamics of star shaped molecules, specifically the longest relaxation time, ?ä, and the viscosity, ?Ø, are slow; ?ä and ?Ø scale exponentially with the degree of polymerization, N, of the chain arm length. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of star shaped molecules is that for low functionalities, f, and for sufficiently large N, they exhibit properties similar to linear chains. However, for very large f, they exhibit behavior akin to colloids. Guided by theoretical predictions, an experimental program, which exploits tools that include neutrons, electrons, X-rays, dielectric spectroscopy, ellipsometry and mechanical instruments, has been designed to develop an understanding of the influence of confinement and interfacial interactions on miscibility, microstructure, structural instabilities, aging phenomena and dynamics in star shaped molecule based systems (linear/star molecule and star/star molecule mixtures). The properties of these systems promise to be truly fascinating and present intriguing possibilities for new science and applications.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/>Diverse technologies, from coatings to functional materials for organic electronic devices and sensors, rely on the properties and performance of polymer thin films. Research on thin polymer films has primarily been devoted to linear chain polymers; little is understood about the properties of chains of different architectures, such as star shaped polymers. Star shaped molecules, by virtue of their architecture offer a number of potential, and unique, advantages over linear chain systems for certain applications. For example, they show promise for adhesive applications, and potentially for certain battery and sensor applications, as it is possible to take advantage of the multi-arm architecture for attachment of molecules/nanoparticles of varying functionalities. The goal of this proposal is to develop an understanding of the role of chain architecture on properties (miscibility, aging phenomena, glass transition and dynamics) of linear chain/star shaped molecule and of star/star molecule mixtures. This is an interdisciplinary program, involving polymer physics, chemistry, interfacial science, thermodynamics and transport processes. It will include an ethnically diverse group, including under represented minorities, of undergraduates, PhD students and high school students. The program also includes an international collaborator in the area of materials synthesis. Outreach activities of the principal investigator include public lectures at technical meetings, retired groups and participation on various National Research Council studies and boards and technical society committees."

Specifically, the proposal aims at (1) producing new knowledge that (a) contributes to current understanding of the mechanisms involved in reforming mathematics and science education systematically in the context of a large urban district, (b) elaborates a model for effective communicating and collaboration among key stakeholders, and (c) bridges the practice/research divide in mathematics and science educational reform; (2) sharing and communication findings that have relevance and utility to those engaged with policy and practice, such as educational planners, administrators, educational researchers, and evaluators; and (3) leveraging future collaborations and communication among those engaged in practice, policy, and research on mathematics and science education. In order to accomplish these goals and objectives, the proposal will conduct a multidimensional study that draws on a body of high-quality, quantitative and qualitative longitudinal empirical data documenting systemic reform efforts over five years of the Chicago Public Schools' efforts to reform K-12 STEM education from the stages of design, planning, and initial implementation through scale-up and adaptation (e.g., from district policy level to implementation of curricular materials in classrooms).<br/><br/>The proposed research is based on a four-dimensional model of issues critical to STEM systemic reform: (1) levels of reform and systems approach (district, school, teachers, and students), (2) scaling-up (depth, spread, and ownership), (3) maintenance across time (context, flexibility, and sustainability), and (4) cross-cutting issues related to challenges and supports for changing practices (accountability/controls, participation/motivation, learning/sense making, relations/trust, and allocation/equity). Longitudinal data inventories addressing these constructs are: (1) system and district level (staff and instructional leader interviews and focus groups), (2) school level (longitudinal in-depth case studies, studies of curricula implementation, principals' interviews), (3) teacher level (surveys and classroom observations), and (4) student level (classroom observations, logs of instructional practice, and district student achievement records).

It is already known, for example, that quantum computers can efficiently factor numbers (something modern computers cannot do), and this fact implies that quantum computers can break the majority of cryptographic systems which protect our nation's cyber-infrastructure. The quantum factoring algorithm is the main motivation behind current research into actually building a quantum computer. In this grant, the investigator proposes a new approach to efficiently solving a computational problem--the graph isomorphism problem--which might also admit an exponential speedup over the best classical algorithm for the problem. The graph isomorphism problem is to tell whether two given graphs (a collection of vertices with edges connecting them) can be made to look identical to each other by permuting the different vertices. The approach taken here is different from that taken by the majority of the quantum algorithms community and centers on a novel class of quantum random walks, those in which the walkers carry topological quantum numbers. This approach follows from a series of failed proposals to graph isomorphism based on random walks by hard-core bosons or fermions and is motivated by the form in which these proposals fail. Finding an efficient quantum algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem would be potentially transformative and would provide a major new justification for building a large quantum computer. The approach chosen by the PI also introduces a novel quantum algorithm technique--quantum random walks by anyons--which has the potential to be useful a primitive outside of the graph isomorphism problem. Finally, the award will be used to support the training of graduate students who work on the boundary between computer science and physics, and thus strengthen connections across this interdisciplinary divide."

Approximately 150 species of moray eels inhabit the Indian and Pacific Oceans, all exhibiting similar widespread geographic distributions, diet, and ecologies. Typically, species that are closely related and similar to one another do not live in the same place at the same time, nor fill the same ecological niche. Understanding the evolutionary history of moray eels will potentially explain this enigmatic pattern. 150 species of moray eels living in the Indian and Pacific Oceans will be sampled for genetic and morphological characteristics that can be used in a phylogenetic analysis of the group. Additionally, four species of moray eels will be intensively sampled throughout their range to estimate levels of migration and gene flow between populations of the same species. <br/><br/>This project will increase our understanding of the evolutionary history of moray eels and of the causes of their unusual ecological distribution. Understanding the levels of migration and gene flow between populations of moray eels will determine whether population genetic structure exists over the broad geographic regions inhabited by these species, and will also inform broader conservation efforts that seek to maintain connectivity between marine protected areas."

The view point is that the theory of theta functions and invariant theory (with relations to the classical Schubert calculus) constitute a common generalization of the classical theory of theta functions.  The spaces of theta functions correspond to physical states in the WZW model of conformal field theory, and this correspondence links the subject to modern mathematical physics.The Hitchin connection on the spaces of non-abelian theta functions lies at the heart of the physics view point on theta functions and several outstanding problems  concerning its properties remain open (unitarity, whether it is ``motivic'').  The aim of the project is to study the Hitchin connection, and to have techniques from conformal field theory  bear upon open problems in invariant theory such as the saturation conjecture for the even orthogonal groups. A study of the Hitchin connection will be carried out with potential applications to strange duality questions (that is, relations between non-abelian theta functions for different groups) in their most general formulation. It is hoped that a study of the strange dualities will lead to insights on the Hitchin connection.<br/><br/><br/>Algebraic geometry studies the solutions to systems of polynomial equations. Representation theory (the theory of symmetry), combinatorics, and mathematical physics have fundamental links with algebraic geometry.

The project aims to deepen the links between theta functions and representation theory. It is hoped that the project will lead to better algorithms in various combinatorial questions. Possible applications outside of mathematics are via contributions to the theory of differential equations (the Riemann-Hilbert problem), to theoretical computer science and physics (string theory and conformal field theory).<br/><br/>"

Young neutron stars are heterogeneous in their properties, and very hard to find. <br/><br/>Dr. Camilo and his group will undertake three complementary searches for young neutron stars by a detailed analysis of existing data from large-scale surveys at radio wavelengths. These data are the most sensitive current probes of neutron stars, at least until the advent of the next generation of radio telescopes. The goals of his work will be to obtain a full picture of the properties of young neutron stars that power bright gaseous nebulae, to determine the birthrate of a newly identified class of high magnetic field young neutron stars, and to characterize the nature of transient radio sources.<br/><br/>This research project will also emphasize the training of graduate students and the involvement of high school students and teachers in frontline scientific inquiry, with a view toward increasing their understanding and appreciation of science.

Further, to support a high technology economic future, today's students also need research experiences that emphasize practical skills, techniques and methodologies that are directly applicable to the development of future science and engineering projects and products. Finally, the greatest opportunity to expand the nation's pool of technical talent will likely come from efforts focused on women and minorities. PACER is a project that brings established techniques and materials to underserved students, and their mentors, in order to foster continued development of research experience programs at minority serving institutions. PACER addresses this issues by 1) providing an intensive 9-week summer research experience program for teams (faculty member plus 3 students) from minority institutions and 2) continuing to partner with each institution for multiple academic years as they establish a research experience program for their local students. In this context, the specific objectives for PACER include: 1) Attract students from the ranks of minorities and women to science and engineering programs, 2) Provide students with a research experience that builds skills, techniques and methodologies applicable throughout their science career, 3) Establish a core of expertise at multiple minority institutions around which a local sustainable student research experience program can develop, and 4) Nurture and mentor these institutions as they implement their student research experience program."

Scientific advancement in biology and in understanding disease pathogenesis will likely depend on the analysis of the huge corpus of biomolecular data (eg. microarray, RNA and DNA sequence data). This advancement is linked to the field's ability to continue developing statistical methodologies capable of identifying a robust ``signal'' which can be reproducibly identified in multiple experiments all of which generate noisy data. The PI has shown how the theoretical framework of spectral analysis with Markov chains unifies several statistical methods for identifying structure in data that is observed with noise: discrete Fourier analysis, correspondence analysis, principle components analysis, as well as spectral clustering. This unifying framework also provides insight into, and generalization of, the more traditional methods listed above. Therefore, the PI's proposed research has two major directions. In one direction, it will continue basic methodological development of exploratory data analysis with a focus on methods capable of identifying biological signals observed in noisy experimental conditions. In another, it will focus on rigorous statistical analysis of this methodology which is in wide use in statistics, computer science and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>Statistical methods developed here will be particularly aimed at the study of cellular regulation of gene and protein expression. These cellular mechanisms have wide ranging importance in understanding human disease including cancer and infectious disease. The data analytic methods developed under this grant will be implemented and made publicly available through Bioconductor, a package in R. The broad goal of this proposal is to work towards providing a methodological unification of methods in statistics, biology and computer science to biomolecular data.

They can thus be used to define the functional roles of proteins in various cellular processes, as well as defining specific domains within these proteins that are important for the proteins to mediate these roles. Furthermore, the aptamer sequences can be used as functional identification ""marks"" of plant proteins that naturally interact with the target proteins. An expression vector and libraries of millions of random aptamers will be developed for use in transient transformation experiments. The vector will allow expression and screening of aptamers first in yeast, and subsequently in plants. The constructions will incorporate bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) technology to detect aptamer-protein interactions, and Gateway technologies to facilitate mobilization of aptamers among various vectors. As proof of concept, tagged plant proteins important for development, and Agrobacterium virulence proteins important for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation will be probed with the aptamer library. This initial work will test whether random aptamers can be used to identify interacting proteins in two different organisms, yeast and plants.

In many ecosystems, nitrogen limits plant growth, but in a large number of tropical forests, it appears to be present in relative excess of what life demands. This excess can cause large losses of nitrogen from tropical forests in forms that affect climate, atmospheric chemistry, and the health and function of aquatic ecosystems downstream. We are beginning to learn that, contrary to our initial expectations, the wettest of tropical forests may function somewhat differently; despite their high rainfall, which can promote high nitrogen losses, some wet tropical forests seem to show nitrogen losses far lower than their drier counterparts. In the Costa Rican forests that will be studied in this project, multiple measures of the nitrogen cycle suggest that nitrogen losses are low; despite abundant evidence from previous work showing that phosphorus is the most important nutrient control here (and thus that nitrogen ought to exist in relative excess). To address this paradox, this project will apply an isotopic nitrogen label (15N) to measure gross rates of nitrogen transformations; this technique provides a useful window into how much nitrogen cycles in an ecosystem, how fast, and if nitrogen losses are truly likely to be low here throughout the year. Additionally, measuring stable isotopic ratios of nitrogen will be used to measure two microbial processes that are likely important in controlling the ultimate fate of nitrogen in this forest; denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). The former can be a key mechanism for losing nitrogen from an ecosystem, as well as for producing the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide; the latter can be a way to help keep highly mobile nitrate ions from leaving an ecosystem and ending up in downstream aquatic environments.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses a fundamental question regarding nitrogen cycling and nutrient limitation in tropical forests. The work is important for several reasons. First, tropical forests appear to be a major source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide; this work will directly address links between a key climate variable (rainfall) and the potential for wet tropical forests to produce this gas. In addition, beyond the threats of climate change, tropical forests are threatened by high rates of land conversion and rapid increases in nitrogen deposition. Given that tropical forests are both a cradle for much of earth's biodiversity and a provider of multiple ecosystem services, this work has direct societal relevance. Scientists? ability to predict how ecosystems may respond to these perturbations depends on their understanding of processes controlling ecosystem function in relatively undisturbed forests. Finally, the wettest of tropical forests are both understudied and yet some of our best hopes for larger scale conservation efforts. This project will enhance our understanding of how these forests function at a basic nutritional level, a key component of our ability to protect and manage them most effectively in a rapidly changing world."

This is a classical topological problem and a special case of the general placement problem: Understand the embeddings of a space X in another space Y. There have been exciting new developments in the area of knot theory and 3-manifold topology in the last 25 years.<br/>From the Jones, Homflypt and Kauffman polynomials, quantum invariants of 3-manifolds, through, Vassiliev invariants, topological quantum field theories, to relations with gauge theory type invariants in 4-dimensional topology (e.g. Donaldson, Witten). More recently, Khovanov introduced link homology as a generalization of the Jones polynomial to homology of chain complexes and Ozsvath and Szabo developed Heegaard-Floer homology, that lifts the Alexander polynomial. These two significantly different theories are closely related and the dependencies are the object of intensive study. These ideas mark the beginning of a new era in knot theory that includes relationships with four-dimensional problems and the creation of new forms of algebraic topology relevant to knot theory. It is a remarkable fact that knot theory, while very special in its problematic form, involves ideas and techniques that involve and inform much of mathematics and theoretical physics. The subject has significant applications and relations with biology, physics, combinatorics, algebra and the theory of computation. We feel that a summer school on this subject is highly appropriate at this time, and we strive to be in the frontier of new developments in knot theory and its applications.<br/><br/>The project has several aspects. It is specialized in its concentration on the theory of knots. Knot theory, while a very focused mathematical activity has wide ramification in other sciences, particularly in physics and in biology and chemistry. Knots themselves occur physically in weaving and in the use of ropes from ancient times to the present day. In recent times, it has been suggested that knotted structures occur in quantum fields at the nuclear level, and knots have occurred significantly in quantum gravity theories and in string theory. In molecular biology DNA molecules can become knotted, and enzymes to avoid knotting are crucial for the replication of DNA and hence for the maintenance of life itself. In chemistry, molecules and long chain polymers can be knotted. The purpose of this summer school and conference is to examine both the applications and the theory of knots at this time. An ICTP Summer school and conference brings together participants from all over the world, third-world countries, women, minorities, and provides an opportunity for researchers and students to share their latest ideas and to collaborate with each other. The knowledge obtained on this occasion will be disseminated by participants throughout the world. All intensive short courses will be taught by experts, and lecture notes will be available online. The presentations include plenary talks by distinguished researchers, including at least 8 women, as well as short talks by other participants. We expect to publish conference proceedings containing cutting-edge research papers and lecture notes which will be suitable for research mathematicians, students, and readers in with background in other exact sciences, including biology, chemistry, computer science and physics."

The sheets can be self-assembled in a single processing step from solution onto a solid substrate, can drape themselves over open holes in the substrate that are hundreds to thousands of nanoparticles across, and exhibit remarkable mechanical strength and robustness, including Young?s moduli of several GigaPascal. As monolayers these sheets are the thinnest structures that can be fabricated from nanoparticle building blocks. The project exploits the fact that the properties of nanoparticle assemblies can be tuned by varying the size, shape and type of the individual particles and, independently, by varying the spacer molecules. Free-standing sheets make it possible to investigate the unique material properties of large assemblies of nanoscale building blocks without interference from a substrate, and at the same time allow for direct experimental access, via a range of probes such as transmission electron or scanning probe microscopies, to the individual building blocks themselves. Combining systematic experiments with simulations of the elastic response, the research addresses a key issue that is still unanswered, namely the detailed mechanisms giving rise to the observed large tensile strength of ultrathin nanoparticle sheets. In addition, new directions are pursued, such as the possibility of introducing mechanical anisotropy through suitable particle shapes, further tunability through the use of magnetic particles, and the feasibility of the sheets as novel resonators.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Nanoparticle self-assembly offers special opportunities for the design of next-generation materials. This project focuses on a new class of ultra-thin sheets, fabricated from single layers of metal nanoparticles. In this ultrathin limit, the sheets combine extreme flexibility with unusual mechanical strength. This combination makes it possible to design novel coatings as well as freely suspended monolayer membranes involving 10 million or more particles. The project also provides a natural platform for integrating research with training and outreach. It will train one postdoc and one graduate student in vital nanoscience know-how, and introduce undergraduates to forefront science. A unique component is a set of outreach activities that include the development and prototyping of small-scale, hands-on activities with a major science museum."

In order to study the mechanism of fatigue life enhancement, we will build a fatigue life model to predict the improved fatigue life considering the time variant residual stresses and hardness under real service conditions. Fatigue testing experiments will be designed to validate this model.<br/><br/>The successful completion of this work will make an improvement to laser shock peening that produces compressive residual stress and a work hardening layer. This work can ensure the benefit of integrating a pre-stressing concept into component design with minimum risk for improved fatigue life, increased reliability and reduced weight. The impact can be transferred to the majority of load-carrying and structural components. This project will meet the challenges of education in materials science, engineering and manufacturing by (a) enhancing interdisciplinary and nontraditional manufacturing for research and education in Purdue University, (b) providing a multidisciplinary research opportunity for students to advance discovery and understanding of cutting edge manufacturing processes and (c) outreach to undergraduate and graduate students to retain them in science and engineering, especially underrepresented and minority students."

The known regiochemical preference for aminolysis at the carboxylate of carboxylic-phosphoric mixed anhydride is a key element to this approach. No technology currently exists for the self-activation of N-protected amino acids in peptide synthesis and the pioneering work in this area has been largely theoretical and aimed at understanding the central role that N-phosphorylated amino acids may have had in the pre-biotic assembly of peptides and oligonucleotides. This project is grounded in the translation of these theoretical studies into a practical and unique methodology for stepwise chemical peptide synthesis through the use of N-phosphorylated amino acids but without the need for additional coupling reagents.<br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Clifford Berkman of the Department of Chemistry at Washington State University. Professor Berkman's research efforts revolve around the preparative methods and the chemistry of phosphorus-containing peptidomimetic structures. This chemistry, as it relates to this project, is expected to lead to a green process for peptide synthesis in which a reaction sequence for self-activation, peptide bond formation, and dephosphorylation will require only mild pH cycling. Successful development of this methodology will have an impact on peptide synthesis in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries."

The purpose of the meeting is to stimulate interest and enhance understanding of the technical and applied aspects of computer algebra. The conference provides a forum for those interested in becoming more active in computer algebra to participate, interact, and meet with others in an inexpensive and easily accessible way. ECCAD is a one-day meeting that is more informal than other technical conferences in the field, with ample time for unstructured interaction. Participation by graduate students and junior faculty is particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the poster session and software demonstrations, and through travel support.<br/>The meeting will include presentations by four invited speakers who have made outstanding contributions in the field of computer algebra. These speakers will anchor the meeting and help attract participants. There will also be a special panel on Future Directions in Computer Algebra, along with the poster and demonstration session. The invited talks, panel, and poster session are expected to cover the entire range of computer algebra: algorithms, systems, and applications. The contributed posters and software demonstrations will enable researchers, especially junior faculty and graduate students, to publicize their recent findings and to make new contacts.<br/>This year's ECCAD is only the second to be held in New England. With many colleges and universities in the area, it is hoped that the meeting will be able to draw a large number of attendees and to generate new interest in computer algebra."

A limited range models will also be explored for rotating stars between 130 and 300 solar masses and for interacting binaries from 10 to 20 solar masses. Surveying a large number of stars is necessary to explore the sensitivity of the results to uncertain explosion parameters and to give the user a library from which to select various choices of explosion energy, stellar initial mass function, mass cut, rotation rate, and mixing. Stars in the lighter mass range may make common supernovae like the Crab, but have a novel explosion mechanism and contribute little to nucleosynthesis. Stars in the upper mass range encroach on the electron-positron pair instability after helium burning and may produce multiple, supernova-like outbursts that can be highly luminous. Multidimensional simulations of mixing and fall back and calculations of shock breakout, light curves and spectra will be carried out in a representative sample of all these models.<br/><br/>Dr. Woosley's models are used as input by many other astrophysicists studying the evolution of galaxies, how supernovae explode, the nature of gamma-ray bursts, and the origin of neutron stars and black holes.

Resilience is the capacity of an ecosystem to return to its previous state following a pulse disturbance such as a cyclone or temperature excursion. Understanding what influences resilience is becoming ever more critical in light of forecasted alterations in disturbance regimes (pulse events) and environmental drivers (press events) associated with global climate change. Global environmental change not only is altering the intensity of press events, it also is changing the frequency and strength of pulse disturbances. Given these complexities, the ability to forecast how ecosystems will respond to or recover from projected changes in pulse and press events is an important scientific challenge. <br/><br/>An unanticipated natural disturbance that is now occurring at the Moorea Coral Reef LTER site provides a propitious opportunity to resolve several key questions regarding resilience, including the trajectory of the system following disturbances that affect different components of the ecosystem, and the existence and strength of positive feedbacks that might produce alternate persistent states. The source of the disturbance is an outbreak of crown-of-thorns seastars (Acanthaster planci) on the reefs surrounding Moorea that has reduced the cover of living coral from ~60% to ~5% cover over large areas. The widespread elimination of just living coral tissue (with coral skeletal structure left intact) provides us the opportunity to manipulate additional features to mimic qualitatively different types of disturbances, and to cross these treatments with various combinations of other environmental stressors. The investigators will conduct surveys and carry out a large field experiment to explore how and why resilience is affected by structural heterogeneity, grazing, corallivory and composition of the microbial community. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project will be far reaching because the scientific community and the public have tremendous interest in and concern about conservation of coral reef ecosystems. Results will greatly increase understanding of these systems, and as such, will inform government officials, resource managers and others charged with conservation and management of coral reefs. Scientific findings and technical information from the project will be broadly disseminated through the MCR LTER website (mcr.lternet.edu), scientific publications and presentations, and in the media. Data will be managed by the MCR LTER and made available on the MCR website in accordance with the data policy standards of the LTER Network. Information derived from this research will be included in MCR LTER outreach activities that involve K-12 programs in Southern California as well as community and school outreach in French Polynesia. Undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, will be involved in research, team research experiences, and development of skills needed to carry out interdisciplinary, collaborative research. The project also will engage in post-doctoral training, and will build international linkages between US scientists and those in South Pacific island nations."

One main thrust is to explore several notions of closure in rings that do not contain a field, such as finitely generated algebras over the integers, with the hope of extending tight closure theory to such rings, thereby solving many open questions. Approaches to the problem of proving existence of big Cohen-Macaulay modules in mixed characteristic are also given. A new theory of quasi-length and content related to certain local cohomology modules will be studied. This theory has raised some difficult, central problems, and is one of several methods proposed to attack the long standing and important question of whether regular rings are direct summands of their module-finite extensions. <br/><br/>The proposed research deals with commutative rings, which are <br/>abstract systems in which one has what might be thought of as artificial numbers. One can add, subtract, and multiply these artificial numbers: call them ring elements. The integers and real numbers are examples, but there are many other examples, including rings that contain only finitely many elements. In one example, one has only 0 and 1, and 1+1 = 0 (like the properties of even and odd integers: odd + odd =even). In studying systems of many equations in many unknowns, one can force the equations to hold in an abstract ring. The study of the properties of this ring gives information about the solutions. One can also study instead a sort of graph of the solutions, that exists in a high dimensional space. It is of great benefit to go back and forth between these algebraic and geometric points of view. A third method, which will be used frequently in the proposed research, is to study solutions that are somewhat like integers (but more general), but to do so while ignoring multiples of a prime number: elements are considered equivalent if they differ by a multiple of this prime. Doing this for many different prime numbers, possibly all prime numbers, can provide a huge amount of information about the solutions of the equations. The proposed research deals with a systematic method, called tight closure, for using this idea, as well as its extensions into new contexts."

Jumps are detected via relaxation of the nuclear quadrupole interaction caused by stochastic fluctuations in either the orientation or magnitude of electric field gradients (EFG). The method has been applied especially to ?line compounds? formed from rare earth and trielide elements (Al, Ga, In). Exceptionally high frequencies have been observed that are attributed to rapid motion of vacancies. Diffusion mechanisms have also been elucidated experimentally by making measurements on pairs of samples of binary alloys having the opposing boundary compositions. Comparison of measured jump frequencies has been used to identify the type of vacancy (rare-earth or trielide) that is predominantly responsible for diffusion. PAC experiments are proposed for a range of binary, pseudo-binary and ternary line compounds. Examples include Al4Ba, in which the EFGs at all sites are collinear, the pseudo-binary compounds In3(La1-xPrx), which all have the L12 structure, and LaCoIn5, a ternary phase that is structurally related to In3La. Short term collaborations have been arranged to check the extent to which jump frequencies of Cd impurity atoms and In host atoms differ.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Diffusion, or atom movement, in solids is important for understanding the mechanical strength and stability of materials and affects many other properties, such as the degree of crystalline order and magnetism. Increasingly complex materials are becoming important to technology and there is great interest in improving our understanding of diffusion phenomena in those materials. Professor Collins and coworkers have pioneered use of a spectroscopy derived from nuclear physics to directly measure frequencies of jumping of probe atoms in highly-ordered compounds. In most solids, atoms move by hopping into vacancies (missing atoms). Unusually high jump frequencies have been found in certain classes of intermetallic compounds. By comparing measurements made on two samples having slightly different compositions, Collins and coworkers have been able to determine whether the vacancy on sites of element A or element B is most responsible for diffusion. This has given an entirely new kind of insight into diffusion phenomena. Studies are proposed on a range of binary and ternary compounds. The project will involve participation and training of graduate and undergraduate students. More than 12 graduate, undergraduate and high-school students participated in research under a previous grant, including six women. Results will be disseminated widely in publications and in conference presentations and seminars. Also, short courses are planned on defects and diffusion and on use of nuclear methods to study solids. A collaboration has been established to carry out some experiments at CERN, the European nuclear physics center in Geneva, that are not possible in the US."

Three sites on the Iranian Plateau (Tal-i Iblis in the South, and Seh Gabi and Godin Tepe in the North) have yielded archaeological evidence for smelting copper. The Plateau region is unique in the persistent use of crucibles (shallow bowl-like vessels) for over two millennia for converting copper ore to metal for despite the presence of more efficient technologies (e.g. the furnace) in the surrounding lowlands and nearby coastal regions.<br/><br/>In order to study the reasons for the persistent use of crucibles, and the earliest metallurgy on the Iranian Plateau in general, one must first develop a dynamic view of metallurgical technology on the plateau. This dynamic view must consider metal production in different locations (with access to different raw materials including ore, fuel, and clay), and it must consider different scales of production (in workshop and residential settings), and changes in social values, trade networks, demand for metal goods, and access to other craftspeople, and therefore other technological processes. This project examines early metal production on the Iranian Plateau by focusing on (1) both published data and new results generated by this project from large-scale production areas, (2) data from trade and urban centers that exhibit evidence of small-scale, ""cottage-level"" metal production and working as well as a wide range of metal artifacts, and (3) the technological choices and technological changes exhibited at these sites that occur with other, non-metal, materials on the Plateau.<br/><br/>This project will contribute significantly to our understandings of the early development of metal technology in the Iranian highlands. In addition, the detailed study of the important highland Iranian sites included in this project, which have been largely neglected since their initial excavation over 30 years ago, will shed new light on the practices of and interactions between Chalcolithic and Bronze Age communities. Furthermore, the methodology and use of social technology theories makes this project anthropologically robust as well as analytically detailed.<br/><br/>Further, the number of scholars studying the archaeometallurgy of Iran is small, but diverse. The broader impacts of this project include contributions to an ongoing dialogue within this international group of German, British, Iranian, Canadian, and American researchers regarding the state of the field and the interpretation of our collective data. The project will also contribute to undergraduate education at the University of Arizona. The experimental archaeological casting is being incorporated as a demonstration and interactive experiment for upper-level undergraduates in Materials Science and Engineering. These classes are designed to help students understand the relationships between processing and properties of materials, and how technology has changed over the past 30,000 years."

They highlight the very delicate interplay of topology and group theory in low-dimensional homotopy theory and also involve other branches of mathematics like geometry, combinatorics, and algebraic K-theory.<br/><br/>This workshop is in succession to similar conferences held in Italy, the Pacific Northwest, and Russia. It aims to maintain needed connections between American and international topologists. The problems to be addressed are geometric in nature, challenging the basic human conception of what three-dimensional space is or can be thought to be. Improvements in the understanding of the topics and problems considered at the seminar may open new avenues of thinking and modelling in topology and eventually in the natural sciences. The workshop format emphasizes detailed discussion of ideas in progress and collaboration of the participants, from graduate students to early-career researchers to senior experts."

The first project is to prove Weibel's vanishing conjecture and Vorst's regularity conjecture for negative K-theory in characteristic p; the characteristic 0 case has been previously handled by Cortinas, Haesemeyer, Schlichting and Weibel. The second project deals with Suslin's singular homology. With coefficients prime to the characteristic over an algebraically closed field these groups are dual to etale cohomology by work of Suslin and Voevoedsky. Geisser proposes to study the behavior of its rational and p-primary part in characteristic p (especially over finite fields), as well as the relationship to etale cohomolgy over non-algebraically closed fields.<br/><br/>In this project, Geisser will study algebraic K-theory and motivic cohomology theories. These theories form invariants which help to understand the structure of the set of solutions to a system of polynomial equations with coefficients and solutions in fields, like the rational numbers, real numbers or complex numbers. These invariants are fairly well understood if the solution set is smooth (for example, curves are smooth if they have no intersections or cusps).<br/>The proposer will try to advance the understanding in the general case, using methods which have been developed recently. This could lead to applications in cryptography, because several cryptosystems rely on (the difficulty in) finding solutions to systems of polynomial equations."

To address these issues, which are important both scientifically and for applications to commercial polymer manufacture, we are performing a combination of the following tasks: 1. Synthesis of high-quality model branched polymers with branches of the same or different length that are carefully designed to test physical theories. 2. Careful characterization of the molecular weight and branching properties of these polymers. 3. Measurement of the linear rheological properties over a wide frequency range. 4. Comparison of the measured viscoelastic properties with predictions derived from the various alternative proposed theories. We plan to accomplish these tasks through a collaborative framework, involving a collaborator, Jimmy Mays, who will use a novel route to synthesize 1) asymmetric H polymers; 2) asymmetric star-on-star polymers, based on a core star polymer, each branch of which terminates in two unequal length branches; and 3) combs with tetrafunctional branch points. These polymers will be carefully characterized by gel permeation chromatography and TGIC, and studied through rheological measurements, including careful long-time creep rheometry with the help of instrumentations and methods available in the laboratory of Prof. John Dealy, a collaborator at McGill University. Existing computational models for predicting the measured rheology will be employed in collaboration with Chinmay Das in the McLeish group at Leeds University. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>To form advanced plastic fibers or thin plastic sheets used for packaging, molten plastic is pulled or stretched at extremely high speeds. The performance of this process depends on how the polymer molecules in the plastic are entangled with each other, and how they escape those entanglements. Polymers that branch into multiple long strands are exceptionally useful for industry, since they serve as netting that strengthens the plastic so that it does not rip or bursting when blown into shape. Larson?s team has found that changes to as few one branch in a million branch points can significantly impact the properties of the melt relevant to its strength as a melt. The reason for this is that branched polymers entangle extremely well with other branched polymers. To escape these entanglements, they must reconfigure by reeling branches towards the branch point, like Houdini dislocating his shoulder to escape a straight jacket. Therefore, the entanglements are long-lived and make the plastic easier to shape. Larson?s team is chemically synthesizing special branched polymers that are exceptionally useful in determining how branched polymers manage to perform their ?Houdini? acts and how to optimize this for advanced performance. Their measurements of the rates at which polymers escape entanglements is providing knowledge that is of great interest to collaborators at Dow Chemical Company and other plastics manufacturing companies. The research has been highly interdisciplinary and international with collaborators at the University of Tennessee, McGill University, the University of Leeds, and Dow Chemical Company."

Dr. Sterling will conduct a spectroscopic investigation of planetary nebulae (PNe) and Wolf-Rayet (WR) nebulae, in order to investigate the production of neutron(n)-capture elements (atomic number Z > 30) by s-process nucleosynthesis in the progenitor stars of these objects. He will observe PNe with a wide range of progenitor masses in the optical spectral region, which provides access to several n-capture elements that are not detectable in stellar spectra. These data will be used to derive s-process enrichment factors, determine key physical conditions and constrain the element-by-element pattern of s-process enrichments in PN progenitor stars with different initial masses, and reveal the s-process neutron source in intermediate-mass AGB stars. In addition, Dr. Sterling will observe WR nebulae in the infrared in order to detect emission lines of Se and Kr, two of the most highly enriched elements by the weak s-process. This will potentially provide some of the first observational evidence of weak s-process enrichments in massive stars. These observations will be complemented by a laboratory astrophysics study to determine atomic data needed to accurately derive the abundances of the n-capture elements Br and Rb in ionized nebulae. The atomic data will be added to the atomic databases of state-of-the-art photoionization codes and made accessible to the broad astrophysical community. This research has implications for the origin and chemical evolution of trans-iron elements in the Universe, and nucleosynthesis and convective mixing during the late stages of stellar evolution. Moreover, this work will establish an observational and atomic physics foundation upon which future nebular studies can be built, enabling chemical evolution investigations of these elements in Galactic and extragalactic environs.<br/><br/>Dr. Sterling will also manage an educational outreach program at Michigan State University comprised of designing and teaching seminars for students, co-teaching Physics and Astronomy Department courses, and advising an undergraduate student research project.

These methods have proven very successful in modeling many aspects of solidification phenomena and are now incorporated in commercially available software packages. More recently the PI and collaborators have introduced a second generation of phase field models that describe phenomena on atomic length and diffusive time scales. This ""phase field crystal"" method naturally incorporates elasticity, plasticity, anisotropy and multiple crystal orientations in addition to all the physics of traditional models of solidification and phase segregation.<br/>While the phase field crystal models developed for monatomic and binary alloys can describe many physical phenomena, including grain growth, epitaxial growth, eutectic solidification, the yield strength of polycrystalline materials, climb and glide, and grain boundary melting, there are many important phenomena that are beyond description by the current models. For example, the binary model cannot describe sublattice ordering in multi-component alloys. This is a key issue since sublattice ordering is extremely common and influences structural properties. Another limitation of current phase field crystal models is that they describe spherically symmetric particles and thus cannot describe the physics associated with extra degrees of freedom, such as rotation. A technologically important example which exploits these freedoms is elastomers; the rotation of elongated cross-linked polymers allows shear strains at almost zero energy cost. The goal of this project is to greatly extend the applicability of phase field crystal modeling to incorporate sublattice ordering and anisotropic particles. <br/>The PI also plans to extend the amplitude expansion of the monatomic phase field crystal developed by Goldenfeld and collaborators to binary systems. The amplitude approach incorporates much of the essential elastic and plastic behavior and is more amenable to analytic and numerical calculations. The resulting model will be used to examine the influence of the discrete nature of the crystalline lattice and compositional in homogeneities on morphological instabilities in strained epitaxial films.<br/><br/>The PI has a contract with Wiley publishing to write a book on phase field modeling in materials science. Much of the text will be devoted to the phase field crystal formulations developed in this proposal and in the expired NSF grant. The text will be written as an instructional guide for engineering and physics students who wish to learn the fundamentals and technical details of phase field modeling. The PI will hire and train undergraduate students in cutting edge computational materials physics. <br/>The work will also have an impact on many areas of research since the methods developed are applicable to a wide range of phenomena such as the structural properties of multi-component alloys, the exotic elastic properties of elastomers and the formation of quantum dots in strained epitaxial growth.<br/><br/>Non-Technical Summary<br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education to further develop a potentially powerful method for computer simulation of materials that was developed by the PI and collaborators.  The research involves the extension of a modeling technique, called phase field modeling, that is computationally fast but useful on length scales of many atoms. The extension enables computer simulations to access information on much shorter length scales, atomic length scales, and longer times. Simulations of materials processing and related materials phenomena that span many length scales from single atoms to microns are promising applications of the new method.<br/><br/>The PI will also write a book on phase field modeling and its application to modeling materials and materials related phenomena. Undergraduate students will be involved in research activities directly related to this project."

This study develops a new statistical method (the ""selection skewers"" analysis) that identifies changes in the relationships among genetic components of traits that would significantly alter the predicted evolution of a population. The performance of this new statistical method will be compared to previous methods. In addition, using laboratory populations of red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) the method will be used to empirically determine when interactions among genes are stable over time, and thus when evolutionary change due to selection can be predicted accurately.<br/><br/>The results will not only provide a needed statistical and conceptual framework for basic studies of evolutionary change, but will enable future studies examining the capacity for natural populations to adapt to climate change and the ability of exotic species to invade new environments. In addition, women and minority students will be trained in the field of quantitative genetics, an area where these groups are still underrepresented. The computer program to implement the selection skewers method will be made freely available on the web."

This object was produced by the explosion of a massive star following the collapse of its inner core, and its proximity allows detailed study of gas velocities and the abundances of many chemical elements.  The main part of the work is the analysis of a large number of spectra obtained at the MDM Observatory near Tucson, Arizona.  The velocities derived from the spectra will be compared to the latest theoretical models of how gas is excited by shocks.  The goal is to create a complete map of all the ejecta, including both parts of the high velocity jets.  <br/><br/>The project will also assemble multiwavelength maps of Cassiopeia A for analysis by this and other research groups.  The study of this object is expected to have many important implications for the general phenomenon of core-collapse supernovae.

Current practices in critical disease care focus on assessing the stage of disease rather than on predicting the progression of disease. Different clinical, imaging and laboratory test modalities are used to assess disease stage. Some assessments have predictive abilities but usually without accounting for interventions. The proposed Critical Disease Data Mining System (CDDMS) will fuse the modality predictions to formulate a holistic prognosis for an individual patient undergoing a particular intervention. This research will validate the hypotheses that data mining can be used for: (1) prognosis about the progression of critical diseases, (2) assessing efficacy of a specific intervention, and (3) formulating a holistic prognosis that is superior to modality predictions. It is expected that the CDDMS holistic prognosis will correlate better with the actual outcomes than the modality predictions. <br/><br/>If successful, the CDDMS will provide customized critical disease care; resulting in earlier and more effective interventions. It will reduce need for multiple, redundant biopsies and surgeries, aid research on population subgroups, monitor specialized interventions, and provide an ongoing self-correcting medical information-management system. <br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."

The most fundamental challenge here is natural expression of parallelism in applications and efficient mapping of such parallelism to the hardware, including data distribution, locality, communication, synchronization, and load balancing. <br/><br/>This collaborative research between Syracuse University and Sandia Labs aims at developing an efficient programming model for high performance computing (HPC) applications using multi-core and heterogeneous processors. The specific goal of this study is to develop a high-level parallel programming abstraction with new high-level language constrctions, data types, and runtime library. Hardware features such as cores, memory hierarchy, processor heterogeneity, and interconnection will be embedded in the semantics of the language constructs and data types. The programming abstraction will guide the design and expression of parallel algorithms in the high-level language, mapped automatically onto the hardware for efficient execution. Users will be free from the low-level hardware details. The approaches include: memory virtualization,communication virtualization and processors virtualization."

Finite-state automata are Turing machines with fixed finite bounds on resource use. Continuing a tradition of studying that part of mathematics which can be performed effectively, the field of automatic structures explores mathematical objects which can be represented by automata. Questions about automatic structures may be grouped into two themes: developing structural characterizations and studying algorithmic consequences of such characterizations. Dr. Minnes has worked in both of these areas, including proving both positive and negative results about the existence of such characterizations. Through this NSF grant, she will work towards answering these guiding questions in the context of less understood classes of structures. For example, the fundamental groups associated with certain manifolds have intimate connections with automata and some sequences arising in symbolic dynamics and combinatorics may be seen as generated by automata. The tools developed by the automatic structures community may lead to a better structural understanding of these objects. In parallel, Dr. Minnes seeks to develop the area of automatic model theory. Much work has been done in understanding how the standard results of model theory change when restricted to the framework of computable or polynomial-time objects. Preliminary work shows interesting analogies in the automatic structures world and suggests the promise of fruitful results.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the increasing reliance of the modern world on computerized and networked systems, the theoretical underpinnings of computational feasibility have gained more immediate relevance. Starting in the 1950s, the Turing machine, an idealized model of a computer with no bounds on memory use or computation time, led to astonishing and foundational insight into what problems can or cannot be solved by any algorithm. This NSF project focusses on a different model for the computer, the finite automaton, which more closely captures online computation and resource bounds. Dr. Minnes will study questions which relate finite automata both to traditional topics of mathematical logic and to new interactions with other fields of mathematics and computer science."

Such waves flow freely through empty space or ordered structures but are impeded by scattering in the pervasive disorder of the world around us. Waves transmitted through disordered samples fluctuate wildly in space due to the scattering. They produce a unique random speckle pattern of intensity, which is a unique fingerprint of the random sample. Nevertheless, there are common elements in the transport for any kind of wave. Microwave and optical measurements demonstrate that each statistical property of transport can be characterized by a single parameter and all such parameters are simply related. The value of these parameters reflects the changing spatial extent of the wave in a transition between freely diffusing and localized waves trapped by disorder within the sample. This award supports a project that will use microwave and optical measurements to obtain the speckle pattern of radiation for different frequencies. The patterns will be analyzed to find the underlying modes of oscillation of the wave, which are akin to the fundamental vibrations of a violin string, as well as the allowed channels for transmission through opaque samples. Approaching the study of wave propagation from different perspectives will lead to a more complete understanding of wave propagation with applications to telecommunications, nano-electronics, photonics and imaging. In addition the microwave and optical measurements will be carried out by high school students, undergraduates and graduate students, and by a postdoctoral fellow. Thus, this project will provide a stimulating training ground for young researchers. <br/><br/>****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****<br/>The nature of wave propagation in disordered samples reflects the spatial and spectral variation of the modes within the medium. When modes are spectrally isolated, the intensity inside the sample is exponentially peaked. However, modes that overlap spectrally may extend throughout the sample. But the wave in the interior of a random sample is hidden from view. This award supports a project that will attempt to overcome this limitation by using microwave and optical measurements of the transformation of transmitted speckle patterns with frequency shift to reveal both the underlying electromagnetic modes and the transmission channels of random systems in the transition from localized to diffusive transport. Analysis of the speckle patterns will enable the calculation of all transmission properties of the waves through the random media. If successful, problems such as the dynamics of localized waves or the statistics of speckle evolution, which have eluded a full theoretical analysis because they involve occasionally overlapping modes, will be resolved. The eigenchannels of the transmission matrix and associated transmission coefficients will be found. This will give an alternate description of the localization transition and will facilitate strategies that will allow for strong transmission of properly phased light though opaque samples. This work will strengthen the CUNY Photonic Center established to enhance the technological base of the New York metropolitan area. Students from local high schools and undergraduates, as well as graduate students and more senior researchers will be actively engaged in the laboratory. Their careers will be fostered by research, which combines microwave and optical techniques to probe a diverse set of problems of fundamental and applied interest."

The program is engaging 12 lower division students per year in math and science teaching through summer internships with local research, professional development, and outreach partners, and is providing scholarships to 10 upper division students per year who are engaged in the new Cal Teach program. The scholarship awards are highly visible within the STEM disciplines, and are identified as awards reflecting student accomplishment and prestige. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program is building on the growing program that Cal Teach has created to encourage STEM undergraduates at Berkeley to pursue careers in math and science teaching, particularly in urban schools, and on strong existing partnerships with local school districts (Berkeley, Emery, and Oakland Unified) and with local research and outreach institutions (Lawrence Hall of Science and the Chabot Space and Science Center). Cal Teach is an integrated program, with early and frequent field placements; this allows aspiring teachers to develop both deep subject matter understanding and exemplary pedagogical skills as they engage in both theory and practice. To accomplish this, Cal Teach engages faculty from the STEM content areas as well as from the Graduate School of Education through an interdisciplinary approach to teacher preparation that has been shown to be critical in the context of training secondary math and science teachers for urban schools, where high quality teachers are severely lacking. Cal Teach is committed to equity in education for every student, promoting social justice through mathematics and science learning. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program brings outstanding students who share this commitment into Cal Teach, with the goal of simultaneous disciplinary degrees in STEM majors and a teaching credential in math or science."

Attempts to add a luminescent spectral down-conversion layer to semiconductor solar cells to shift inefficiently-utilized light below 500 nm in the solar spectrum to longer wavelength have been made over several decades because of predicted relative efficiency gains of 10-20%, a very significant improvement. No practical device has resulted because of the very high performance requirements for the emissive over-layer. Manganese-doped zinc selenide nanoparticles exhibit little absorption longer than 500 nm, yet luminescence with high efficiency in a single band near 600 nm, thus eliminating both optical filtering and luminescence reabsorption. The objective of this project is to evaluate this material?s potential to be a practical spectral down-converter. This involves modeling calculations using solution data as input, measurement of actual performance gains using liquid-reservoir down-converter plus solar cell, and preparation of concentrated thin solid films and their photophysical evaluation. It will then be possible to determine the efficiency gains that can be expected from an integrated thin-film down-converter/solar cell module.<br/><br/>The broader impacts/commercial potential of even small improvements in the efficiency of polycrystalline silicon solar cells, which represents a mature technology are very difficult and costly to realize.

Furthermore, a substantial proportion of underrepresented ethnic minorities commence their post-secondary education in 2YCs, along with a significant number of future K-12 teachers who complete their science courses in 2YCs.  Considering the contribution of 2YCs to the education of the future STEM workforce, it is imperative that 2YCs students receive exceptional science education. The CCLI program is one of the most important NSF program to support innovation in undergraduate chemical education.  More than one-third of undergraduates are educated in 2YCs, yet the number of CCLI awards granted to chemistry departments in 2YCs is exceedingly disproportionate.  This project is providing 2YC chemistry faculty opportunities to enhance their ability to prepare quality grant proposals intended for submission to the CCLI program.  Chemical educators from both 2YCs and four-year institutions who have been successful in acquiring CCLI funding and managing CCLI-funded projects are leading this project.  A one and half day workshop, offering 2YC chemistry faculty comprehensive training in grant proposal preparation, is being followed with post-workshop support to assist the participants in CCLI proposal preparation.   The project is including no less than twenty percent of participants from underrepresented groups.  Furthermore, this project is catalyzing collaboration between the community of 2YC chemistry educators and the leadership within the Chemical Education Research (CER) group, fostering dissemination of the valuable discoveries and methodologies uncovered by the CER leaders, enhancing the capacity of chemists in 2YCs to educate their students."

This site, dating from between ~350,000to ~290 000 years ago, has yielded very large stone artifact and animal bone assemblages and seven fossil human teeth. For part of its depositional history, Orgnac 3 was a cave, and for another, it was a sink-hole. The site preserves large samples from short time periods within the long Middle Pleistocene interval. It contains charcoal/sooty lenses with burnt bones that have been interpreted as hearths and accumulations of artifacts and bones surrounded by natural rocks that may represent the bases of dwelling structures. For these reasons the Orgnac 3 materials lend themselves to answering many questions about human paleoecology during the middle and late Middle Pleistocene.<br/><br/>Much work in paleoanthropology has focused on one particular aspect of human paleoecology, that of subsistence strategy. When people started acquiring meat and other animal tissues, whether through scavenging or hunting, and how human subsistence strategies have changed over time, remain hotly debated topics. How different human populations might have foraged differently, and the evolutionary import of those differences, are important questions to ask of the archaeological and paleontological records. This is especially true when considering the Middle and Late Pleistocene, when different human species lived on different continents, but by the end of the Pleistocene, only one species remained: Homo sapiens. To reach the ultimate goal of understanding changes in subsistence strategy throughout human history, one must begin with a robust, scientific reconstruction of how a sample faunal assemblage passed through several stages in which hominid activity or natural processes could have altered its composition. This project adopts such a holistic approach to document the carcass acquisition and processing behaviors of the human inhabitants of Orgnac 3 and to examine how these behaviors have changed throughout the evolution of the human species. Once the carcass acquisition and processing behaviors of the Orgnac 3 people have been characterized, these can be compared to other Middle Pleistocene sites in Europe and Africa in order to elucidate how these behaviors have changed through time and across space.<br/><br/>Beyond research questions of interest to prehistoric archaeologists, this project will have a broader impact by providing assistance in graduate student training and strengthening collaborative relationships between institutions in US and France, specifically those between Stanford University and the Centre Européen de Recherches Préhistoriques in Tautavel and Institut de Paléontologie Humaine in Paris. This work will increase awareness of one of the oldest and largest fossil human sites in France. Furthermore, the primary data generated here will be made available to the Centre Européen de Recherches Préhistoiriques, for them to use in their own research, curation planning, and pedagogical development (in their educational materials and in the adjoining Centre Européen de Préhistoire )."

Predicting the responses of the earth and biological systems to rising temperatures and the complex mixture of increasing gases (carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide) is challenging as it is difficult to control these multiple parameters and create replicated experiments, especially on a scale large enough to study biological communities. How elevations in trace gases will affect the capacity of communities to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is unknown. Changes in atmospheric composition over geologic time have been hypothesized to drive major evolutionary changes, but these hypotheses are difficult to evaluate without experimental tests of atmospheric composition on organisms. Air pollutants have been implicated in the dramatic recent elevations in respiratory diseases like asthma, but facilities for experimentally testing the effect of atmospheric composition are insufficient. This award, jointly funded by the National Science Foundation's BIO and GEO directorates, will support a workshop to discuss the design and implementation of a national facility to study the effects of atmospheric composition and climate on biological and earth processes. The workshop participants constitute a diverse group of scientists in terms of scientific expertise, gender, geographic origin, ethnicity, and career stages.

This group includes a well studied freshwater invertebrate Hydra, whose body consists of a tubular column with a ring of tentacles on top. Because the genetics and physiology of Hydra have been thoroughly examined and it grows well in the laboratory, the species is a valuable genetic and developmental resource. The goal of this study is to document the role of genes controlling development in Hydra and two related species that differ markedly in the construction of their body columns and the size and location of tentacles on the column. These differences in body plan are caused by differences in the timing of gene expression and the locations on the body column where genes are turned on and off. By examining when and where these developmental genes are active in the bodies of the animals, this study will gain insight into the evolution and function of these genes in the development of body plan morphology in these simple invertebrates. Using a comparative approach of studying three closely related species with different body plans, the study will provide insights into the role of developmental genes in the evolution of morphological diversity.<br/><br/> The research will be integrated into an undergraduate course on embryology and development. Additionally, an undergraduate student will take conduct an independent research project. A web site for the public and other researchers will synthesize information on developmental genetics of these organisms, which are important models for understanding development in many species."

Near shore islands are likely to experience higher rates of colonization and subsequent gene flow among populations, and thus exhibit less evolutionary differentiation from each other and from mainland relatives. These predictions, however, remain largely untested. This study will investigate the patterns of colonization and divergence among native buckwheats endemic to California's Channel Islands. Understanding the patterns of gene flow and differentiation over small geographic distances will allow a more nuanced understanding of how island area and distance from the mainland affect evolutionary dynamics on islands and other isolated areas.<br/><br/>The project will promote appreciation of the unique Channel Islands flora and the findings will be immediately applicable to the management of rare Channel Island buckwheats. Moreover, the molecular methods developed will enhance conservation studies of other rare island plants. The project will enhance science education by providing undergraduate research opportunities and instructional modules for students at the University of South Dakota, a rural predominantly undergraduate institution that serves a high proportion of first generation college students. Funding also will enrich local K-12 education through outreach activities and supply interpretive information for Channel Island natural history programs."

The complex nature of the coupled electromagnetic and thermo-mechanical phenomena that occur during these rapid processes, have not been the object of a systematic study from the mechanics standpoint. The goal of the proposed work is a systematic investigation of electromagnetic loading phenomena, which is expected to help: a) characterize, using fundamental experiments, the constitutive response of structural metals under EMF conditions and: b) establish the modeling capability required for such processes, and validate with experiments in which full field strain measurements will be performed in real time.<br/><br/>The proposed study will enable a useful new technology, since the EMF process has the advantage of being a rapid, low-waste and environmentally friendly process for manufacturing parts out of alloys that are difficult to shape through conventional means. Recent advances in electronics and energy storage technology make EMF technology ripe for mass production, and plans are well under way for the large scale manufacturing of fuel cell plates and tubular frames for the automotive industry. The fundamental understanding of this process will significantly push the use of EMF towards large-scale applications through links that have been established with interested industry to facilitate such transition.

The size of male wings differs dramatically between Nasonia species. In one species male wings are very small and males cannot fly, whereas in another the wings are large and males do fly. The structure of a major gene affecting this sex-specific trait will be determined by positional mapping. Then, the downstream regulatory processes through which this gene changes wing cell size and number will be identified in a genome expression experiment. Finally, the fitness consequences behind wing size reduction will be tested under different conditions.<br/><br/>This project will provide new information on the regulation of cell growth and replication, processes that are fundamental to development and that contribute to diseases such as cancer and diabetes. The proposed studies will integrate discovery across biological disciplines, from genetics to development, molecular biology, genomics and adaptation. Training for a graduate student in these cross-disciplinary approaches is provided, including travel to a genome biology center to learn new methods and conduct experiments. This training will be used to develop undergraduate laboratory exercises in computational genetics.

Characterized by an extremely low density, EPS geofoam has become the material of choice in a variety of geotechnical problems requiring lightweight fill for slope stabilization, embankments on soft soils, earth retaining structures, bridge approaches, bridge abutments, and buried pipes. During recent years, increasing consideration has been given to the compressible inclusion function of EPS geofoam associated with its low stiffness, which makes geofoam an ideal material for reducing the seismic lateral earth pressures against rigid non-yielding retaining structures (e.g., below grade building walls, bridge abutments, or restrained walls). Vertical EPS panels installed against such structures may act as seismic buffers reducing the seismic wall thrust during an earthquake. Recent findings from numerical simulations and physical shaking table tests addressing the seismic behavior of buried structure walls with EPS buffer are quite promising indicating significant reduction in the dynamic wall thrust compared to the rigid case with no geofoam inclusion. Although the behavior of EPS geofoam under monotonic loading conditions has been extensively studied in the laboratory using triaxial compression tests, little research has been done until present on the cyclic stress-strain behavior of this material. Currently published dynamic properties of EPS geofoam obtained from strain-controlled resonant column and cyclic uniaxial tests, and commonly employed by investigators in numerical seismic analyses, are characterized by degradation of dynamic shear modulus and increase in damping ratio with increasing cyclic shear strain amplitude. However, results from a preliminary laboratory study based on stress-controlled cyclic uniaxial tests indicate a logarithmic decrease in the damping ratio of EPS geofoam with increasing axial strain amplitude. Furthermore, for cyclic axial strain amplitudes greater than about 0.8%, the material seems to exhibit a visco-elasto-plastic behavior associated with the occurrence of permanent plastic strains. These experimental outcomes demonstrate that the cyclic stress-strain characteristics of EPS geofoam are currently poorly understood. In this context, the main objective of this research is to use laboratory triaxial tests to investigate in detail the behavior of geofoam under cyclic loading. This experimental investigation will be based on stress-controlled cyclic triaxial tests, and will focus on non-elasticized EPS materials commonly used in geotechnical applications. Particular emphasis will be placed on the influence of the following parameters: confining pressure, initial (static) deviator stress, cyclic deviator stress amplitude, loading frequency, EPS density, and specimen size. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This research will provide a better understanding of the fundamental stress-strain behavior of EPS geofoam under cyclic loading that is invaluable in optimizing the seismic buffer function of this material in geotechnical earthquake engineering applications. Specific questions to be addressed include: 1) What is the threshold cyclic axial strain amplitude for the onset of the elasto-plastic stress-strain behavior? 2) How are the dynamic properties of EPS geofoam affected by the confining pressure and initial deviator stress? 3) In what manner the permanent plastic strains accumulate with increasing number of loading cycles? 4) How does the specimen size influence the cyclic stress-strain behavior of EPS geofoam?<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will significantly expand our knowledge on the cyclic stress-strain behavior of EPS geofoam for a variety of material densities, initial stress conditions, and loading frequencies commonly encountered in practice. A reference website summarizing the geofoam dynamic properties obtained from the proposed laboratory work will be developed and advertised to the investigators involved with the assessment of the seismic behavior of EPS geofoam in various geotechnical earthquake engineering applications. The project will provide a University of Utah graduate student with training experience in laboratory triaxial testing and will expose an undergraduate student to various geotechnical research activities."

This study will test the general hypothesis that global change results in altered ecosystem function and reduced biodiversity. Specifically, the relationships among nitrogen deposition (a component of global change), soil carbon storage (an ecosystem function) and the functional diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (symbiotic fungi associated with the roots of numerous plant species) will be examined using novel phylogenetic and molecular approaches. <br/><br/> This study will provide insights into how changes in nutrient inputs and biodiversity will affect ecosystem function, and it will generate novel information that has applications within the fields of agriculture, conservation biology and restoration ecology.

This project aims at solving those problems through studies of nano-mechanics and bio-tribological modeling for durable UHMWPE nanocomposites reinforced by newly developed graphitic nanomaterials. This research will result in a new design methodology for polymer materials used in artificial joints, and thus lead to optimal UHWMPE nanocomposites and dramatically extended life expectancy for total joint replacements.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this project will provide a base for design and development of tribologically durable UHMWPE materials that can lead to longer life spans for a variety of artificial joints to meet a wide range of patient needs.

Flynn<br/><br/>Abstract<br/>Located at the cross-roads of intercontinental migrations of terrestrial mammals, Asia plays a crucial role in our understanding of mammalian evolution, zoogeography, and related questions about species first appearances in surrounding continents and their function as major markers of biochronology. This strategic geographic position is particularly apparent during the Neogene (~24-2 million years ago) when Asia was intermittently connected to Africa and North America, and widely connected to Europe. A well-established mammalian biostratigraphic framework in Asia will go a long way toward a global picture of mammalian evolution. Despite such importance and promise, however, Asia lags behind Europe and North America in the studies of terrestrial biostratigraphy and geochronology, and many unresolved issues become bottlenecks for detailed understanding of mammalian evolution elsewhere. This proposed roundtable workshop, to be held in Beijing in June 2009, represents the first large-scale gathering of world experts on Asian terrestrial mammal biostratigraphy and geochronology, including scientists with expertise in biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, biochronology, zoogeography, paleoenvironment, as well as phylogenies of various groups of extinct mammals. In addition to offering the latest progress from individual regions and countries, the workshop will initiate in-depth discussions about the best methods to establish a mammalian biostratigraphic framework and will produce a book (Columbia University Press) that is the only comprehensive treatment of Asian terrestrial geochronology. This volume will represent the state of the art in construction of an Asian temporal framework, and will become a standard reference for many years to come, not only for students of mammalian biochronology in Asia, but also for the geoscience community in surrounding continents in Europe, Africa, and North America. The workshop will foster broader collaborations among specialists who are limited by a previously regional view, and lay the groundwork for establishing the first working network of vertebrate paleontologists across the study area. The workshop offers unprecedented opportunities for collaboration among geologists and paleontologists.

Classical views of trophic cascades emphasize the positive indirect effect that predators have on basal resources through their consumption of prey. Yet growing evidence indicates that we must refine our view of how different trophic levels are dynamically linked because trophic cascades can also be caused by predator-induced changes in prey behavior such as foraging activity. <br/><br/>Despite abundant theory we have a limited empirical understanding of the factors that shape individual foraging decisions that, in turn, dictate the nature and strength of indirect effects in natural communities. Drs. Trussell and Luttbeg will use a model comparison and null hypothesis approach to explore the relative importance of density (DMIIs) and trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) to trophic cascades on rocky intertidal shores. Using a tri-trophic food chain as a model system, they will manipulate factors predicted to influence prey behavior and thus the relative strength of TMIIs in trophic cascades. <br/><br/>The researchers will achieve these objectives by addressing the following questions: <br/>1. How do resource levels, prey state, and predation risk shape prey foraging and growth functions? <br/>2. How do resource levels, prey state, and predation intensity shape prey mortality functions? <br/>3. What model best describes the short-term influence of these factors on prey foraging behavior and the strength of emergent indirect effects? 4. Do models supported by short-term data accurately predict longer-term prey behavior and the strength of emergent indirect effects? <br/><br/>The research will make significant intellectual contributions to ecology by exploring whether attention to individual behavior improves our ability to predict the nature and strength of indirect effects in natural systems. By evaluating alternative models with empirical data, our research is novel and will build a stronger connection between ecological theory and its empirical base. Moreover, because species interactions are central to major issues in ecology, such as the use of trophic cascade theory to manage natural systems, it is critical that we understand how behavior is modified by environmental context. <br/><br/>Broader impacts are considerable. The research will allow students at all educational levels to pursue their interests in ecology. Graduate and undergraduate training will occur during all phases of the research. As part of Northeastern?s Young Scholars Program they also will offer a summer research internship each year to a high school student from the Coastal Ocean Science Academy (COSA) that is taught by the Marine Science Center?s Outreach staff. These students are largely members of under-represented groups from Boston area public high schools. In addition to providing these students with plenty of field experience, they also will teach them how to (1) conduct basic statistical analyses, (2) write a scientific paper, and (3) develop and deliver an oral presentation on their internship experience to the Marine Science Center community."

Under this methodology, two or more self-calibrated, outdoor wireless video cameras are initially placed at a project site and collect video-streams. Using the construction materials and shapes visual recognition methods that the investigator has previously developed, each project related entity on the cameras' field of view is identified as an ""interesting"" pattern to track. The pixel area that it occupies in each camera is marked. Based on each entity's area centroid and epipolar geometry, the corresponding entities on each camera's view are matched, to determine the 4D position of each entity. Established tracking techniques are then used in each subsequent frame of the video stream to track the movement of the identified ""interesting"" entity while it operates within the cameras' viewing spectrum. Tracking of project related entities, such as materials, equipment and personnel, has been a significant topic of research for the last decade. Trackers, and especially automated trackers, are useful in progress monitoring and inventory control applications for construction sites, materials management, collision/accident prevention tools and security applications. Tracking records can also be used in activity sequence analysis for optimal path determination and processes redesign. Existing vision-based tracking technologies can be divided in model-based and user-driven approaches. The major advantage of model-based techniques is that they are highly efficient and precise in following the modeled targets. The limitation is their need for fairly elaborate entity models. Correspondingly, the major advantage of user-driven approaches is their wide-range applicability while their limitation is the lack of prior knowledge of the tracked entities' characteristics and the need for a user to select the ""interesting"" entities manually. Therefore, in a construction site where large numbers of different material types, personnel and equipment are involved, one would need to create elaborate models for each type of entity that needs to be tracked, or manually select each entity to be tracked every time that entity would enter a camera's view. These are the limitations that the proposed research addresses by automatically recognizing the related entities and directing a generic tracker to follow them accordingly.<br/><br/>If successfu, this research is expected to substantially increase the efficiency and quality of the information technology processes involved in civil infrastructure construction and in manufacturing. This in turn will result in cost and time savings, will improve the competitiveness of the U.S. construction industry, and will reduce life cycle costs of civil infrastructure."

The workshop will be held in Braunwald, Switzerland and will last 5 days from June 29 ? July 3, 2009. The meeting is capped at ~125 participants, with ~20 US participants planning to attend, including one invited keynote speaker, Magali Billen, from the University of California Davis. Geodynamical research is a critical element in geophysical research, providing a linkage between dynamical processes and seismological, mineral physics, geochemical, and geodetic observations. Geodynamical modeling provides a powerful tool to investigate heat transport, thermal and chemical evolution, and the driving forces behind plate tectonic processes. Computational and experimental techniques are continually advancing, largely due to the sharing of technical information and ideas between scientists. As in past years, this workshop aims to provide an environment in which geodynamicists from around the globe can interact in a very technical, specialist atmosphere compared to typical, much-broader international meetings. Furthermore, several members from other disciplines are invited, and we will explore how geodynamical modeling can be best integrated with other geophysical disciplines to tackle big picture problems currently facing the community. The primary goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for detailed discussion on technical issues associated with geodynamical modeling and how it can be integrated with other fields to address current scientific questions. It will also serve to introduce junior scientists to latest advances in geodynamical modeling and to foster interdisciplinary and international collaboration. Most importantly, the workshop will provide a means for American graduate students and postdocs to meet their European colleagues with the goal of fostering international research collaborations and employment opportunities that will last well into the future, motivating scientific discovery."

This phenomenon consists of seismically recorded tremor events with characteristic frequencies of 1-6 Hz, coupled with slow slip events observed by global positioning systems and strainmeters, with durations of order weeks. Both tremor and slip have been well documented in a variety of environments worldwide, such as subduction zones in Japan and Cascadia. Although the seismic community continues to make interesting observations, the underlying physical process remains poorly understood. There have been many proposed mechanisms, several of which invoke fluids, but thus far, there is little data with which to evaluate these ideas. This problem is being addressed in this project by determining whether or not there are structural changes in the crust and upper mantle associated with this phenomenon. If there are such changes, they would provide an important new clue in understanding the Episodic Tremor and Slip phenomenon. The method of time-dependent seismology is being applied to this problem, to determine whether there are changes in the seismic wavefield during or after such events. The focus is on the slab interface, due to its likely central role in the Episodic Tremor and Slip process, to look for structural changes that may reflect the migration of fluids or other related changes in the medium. A controlled-source approach is being used to look for such changes by conducting a time-dependent seismic imaging experiment in Cascadia. Cascadia was chosen because the well-known periodicity of Episodic Tremor and Slip events permits experimental deployments. Controlled sources are a promising approach, because of superior time resolution and repeatability, compared to other types of sources (e.g. repeating earthquakes, ambient noise tomography). This deployment is designed to demonstrate to the community that it will be possible to observe and utilize the seismic phases of interest, namely those that interact with the slab interface. This is a modest proof-of-concept deployment that, if successful, will lead to an expanded deployment for the 2010 event. The experimental configuration being used permits the clear observation of slab-interaction phases where ETS is strongest. This source-receiver geometry corresponds to a Northwest-Southeast-oriented line through the Olympic Peninsula. The source is being deployed at the southern end of this line, permitting the use of data from the Earthscope-funded Array-of-Arrays deployment (185 stations), which will deployed to the north for both the 2009 and 2010 events. An additional 50 stations is also being deployed through this project that connects the source to the Array of Arrays receivers along the seismic line."

Though significant progress has been made in the case of multidimensional scalar conservation laws, there is currently no general theory for multidimensional systems of hyperbolic conservation laws. One of the main difficulties is that solutions can develop singularities in finite time, regardless of the smoothness of the initial data. These singularities are known as shock waves. For the strictly hyperbolic one-dimensional system, it can be shown that if the initial data has sufficiently small total variation, then there exists a global entropy solution in the space of functions of bounded variation. However, solutions of conservation laws are not in general functions of bounded variation. Moreover, it has been shown that the space of functions of bounded variation is mathematically insufficient for describing solutions of multidimensional systems of conservation laws. These shortcomings in the state-of-the-art theory for systems of conservation laws have motivated the principal investigator to develop a theory for divergence-measure fields. Divergence-measure fields provide a more general framework for characterizing solutions of systems of conservation laws. The principal investigator conjectures that solutions of systems of conservation laws have a special structure, in the sense that the shock waves are supported on a codimension-one rectifiable set where the solution has strong traces. Outside the shock waves, the solution is conjectured to be approximately continuous. This project will investigate these questions by analyzing the blow-up limits of the rescalings of the solution directly on the equation given by the entropy inequality. This plan hinges on the analysis of divergence-measure fields in that the existence of strong traces of the solution are related to the existence of weak normal traces of divergence-measure fields. Moreover, the analysis of divergence-measure fields provides information on the entropy dissipation measures. The project will also explore the structure of solutions to degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic equations, for they relate to divergence-measure fields in the same fashion as the solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws.<br/><br/>Conservation laws and their associated vector fields govern physical processes from broad scientific disciplines, including fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, acoustics, chemistry, and electromagnetism. Shock waves are ubiquitous in physical systems, occurring in aerodynamics, biological systems, and chemical processes, yet their mathematical structure is not well understood. The analysis of the structure of solutions of systems of hyperbolic conservation laws will open new doors to the understanding of shock waves. The analysis of the space of divergence-measure fields, which is larger than the space of so-called bounded variation vector fields and is the focal point of this project, will provide new tools to research other equations where ""weakly differentiable vector fields"" appear. The research plans of this proposal are tightly integrated with the mentoring of graduate students and cross-collaborations. This will encourage research dissemination through collaboration among students, postdocs, and faculty who will be interacting with the principal investigator. She will also integrate her research plan with activities intended to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, as she has done in the past."

The primary objective of this program is thus the development of 50 highly qualified teachers for these high-need urban schools, through targeted financial and academic support. The program is being implemented by a team of faculty from the science, mathematics, and teacher education departments at York College, in collaboration with representatives of four partnering community colleges: Borough of Manhattan Community College, Bronx Community College, LaGuardia Community College, and Queensborough Community College of the City University of New York. An additional partner is the New York City Department of Education. Scholars are being recruited from York and the partnering community colleges, all of which serve underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>For York College students preparing to be teachers, the most significant financial burden comes during student teaching, which often necessitates their withdrawal from full time employment. Thus, the scholarships focus on financial support during this year, with academic support and development programs being provided from the post-freshman summer through the second year of teaching. The academic support program includes three critical phases: 1) engagement of potential Scholars in a Teacher Explorer summer program, 2) support and development of the Scholars during the completion of their college education and teacher preparation program, and 3) professional development and support of teachers during their first two years in the classroom. The MaST program also involves Scholars and faculty in both STEM and teacher education research: as part of extensive field experiences, the Scholars create research-based curriculum for underrepresented urban students, and serve as both subjects and collaborators in the research about the development of themselves as emerging teachers. As well as serving to increase the number of highly qualified science and mathematics teachers for urban, high-needs districts, and striving to improve the retention of these teachers in urban schools, the program is contributing to the knowledge base concerning ways to support science and mathematics secondary education. Results of the program and related research are being disseminated through journals, conferences, and websites. The Scholars and new teachers in addition share results of their research within their learning communities and through their own publications and presentations."

However, if some offspring are more promising than others, parents may instead benefit from diverting resources to high-value individuals. In birds, nestlings display brightly colored mouth parts that may allow parents to assess the relative quality of chicks. In nestling house sparrows, for example, the intensity of yellow mouth coloration is positively associated with condition, and parents deliver more food to more yellow nestlings. This project further examines the relationship between coloration and nestling health. First, a study in which partial broods are cross-fostered will examine the relative contribution that pre- and post-hatching environment make to mouth color. If rearing environment explains most variation, this will suggest that color integrates information about post-hatching conditions (e.g. diet, parasite infection). If parentage explains most color variation, this will suggest that colors may instead reveal nestling qualities driven by genetics or characteristics of the egg (maternal effects). A second experiment examines the effects of a blood-sucking insect parasite, and a virus that it transmits, on nestling mouth color. If mouth colors are associated with nestling health, nestlings exposed to parasites and virus should be less yellow than nestlings not exposed, and color should positively predict the ability of nestlings to withstand infection. Together, these two studies examine how nestling mouth color integrates information about past challenges and predicts future resilience, as well as identifying possible genetic and pre-hatching constraints on this signaling system. This project will offer insights into why parents benefit from favoring certain offspring as well as identify correlates of infection survival in wild birds. Broader impacts of this project include training of a graduate student, mentorship of an undergraduate student and contributions to exhibits at the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History and to the Oklahoma City Zoo."

Groups, often acting on behalf of a population, must choose between competing alternatives and use majority rule to decide which alternative to support. Firms deciding on competing investment projects, hiring by academic departments and in some cases, even the determination of guilt or innocence in jury trials are examples. The assemblage of these groups, the time invested to hear and decide on alternatives, and the consequence of the decision, may extend well beyond the group making the decision. <br/><br/>Beginning with Condorcet (1785), groups have been shown to outperform individuals in choosing the superior of two alternatives when using majority rule. This conclusion rests heavily upon the assumption that group members vote independently. That is, they do not take into account the information and opinion of others, nor are they influenced by other group members. However, research in sociological social psychology has shown that groups tend to display correlated behavior thereby violating the assumption of independence. The investigators argue that social structures emerge within groups predicated upon either status or social identity which induce predictable forms of correlated behavior. Specifically, the level of social diversity within a group is particularly important in generating predictable patterns of correlated behavior. The investigators construct a new laboratory experiment to determine if (i) the level of diversity affects the degree of correlated behavior, (ii) groups predicated upon status and social identity differ in their form of correlation, and (iii) majority rule will be less effective in status diverse groups as opposed to identity diverse groups. This experiment will be conducted at the Laboratory for Sociological Research at the University of South Carolina and will collect voting behavior from subjects participating in two stage voting games. Prior research has not empirically tested the impact of social diversity on majority rule and this study therefore offers a new test for an original theory of voting. <br/><br/>In terms of broader impact, this project offers to deepen our understanding of how social hierarchies affect group decision making. Theoretically, a key contribution is that we integrate rational choice and social psychological approaches in a more comprehensive model of collective decision making. Empirically, the research creates a new experimental paradigm to test these ideas, the development of which adds to the training and research experience of both graduate and undergraduate students in the Laboratory for Sociological Research at the University of South Carolina. Overall, the study seeks to uncover fundamental principles that characterize collective decision making that have the potential to transform how we think about collective decision making mechanisms. The research will inform scientists and practitioners alike. The former include students of sociology, social psychology, economics, political science, and organizational psychologists; the latter include private and public organizations that employ team or group frameworks that rely on majority rule in their decision making processes. At issue is the understanding of how social structure in general, and social diversity specifically, affect the institutional rules we use to make decisions in democratic societies."

When researchers want to study how species are formed, they study breeding barriers. In marine animals that reproduce by broadcast spawning, sperm and eggs are released into the water, where fertilization occurs. For these species the most common breeding barriers occur when a sperm tries to penetrate an egg: if the proteins on the surface of the sperm don't match the proteins on the surface of the egg, the sperm cannot fertilize the egg. This project identifies the sperm proteins important in fertilization in a marine invertebrate. In addition, the researchers will compare these proteins in two species that have breeding barriers between them, to learn how the differences in the proteins contribute to the breeding barriers. This research will provide fundamental information about the fertilization process.<br/> The researchers will participate in a collaboration between the Harrison laboratory and the Museum of the Earth at the Paleontological Research Institution (PRI) beginning in Summer 2009.

Lovinger	07/31/2012	"$126,811.00"		greg.mckenna@ttu.edu	349 Administration Bldg	Lubbock	TX	794091035	8067423884	MPS	1773	"7504, 7916, 9161, AMPP"	$0.00	"TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The present EAGER proposal is a collaborative effort among four U.S. institutions (Texas Tech University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cornell University and Illinois Institute of Technology) and one foreign institution (Technical University of Eindhoven in the Netherlands). The technical goal is to detail the limits of validity of reported flow instabilities in entangled polymer melts and solutions. The flow of polymer fluids in conventional rheometers is generally assumed to be nearly viscometric and stable. When instability or secondary flows occur, it is generally acknowledged that such measurements cannot be used to determine material parameters. This is important in any experimental challenge to, e.g., a molecular theory such as the reptation model of polymer chain dynamics. According to a new set of results that has appeared in the literature, the basis for the experimental verification of the reptation theory is, in fact, based upon experiments from non-homogeneous flows. If this is true, it changes the paradigm for the dynamics of polymer fluids in nonlinear deformation regimes. However, much of the community is skeptical of these results and there are multiple reports in the literature of contradictory results. Hence, it is paramount to establish the range of both flow conditions (rate and magnitude of shear) and material parameters (e.g., entanglement density) for which such observations are correct and the range where errors may have been made and to do so in a way that the results are accepted by the community at large. The present proposal is constructed to do this. The groups collaborate through an innovative set of student teams having one representative from at least three institutions for all experiments. Success of the work is defined as achieving an interlaboratory consensus of the flow profiles in polymer solutions and melts. Objectivity is developed by having multiple labs with multiple students performing each type of experiment so that ?neutral eyes? have the major influence in the examination of experimental data. Three types of experiments will be performed, each will be performed in at least two labs and one will be performed in all labs. The experiments are particle tracking velocimetry, confocal microscopy fluorescence dye velocimetry and macroscopic parallel plate-cone and plate comparisons of nonlinear properties. <br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The major paradigm of polymer rheology is the reptation theory. Because reptation is the present paradigm for polymer flow, it is widely used in industrial settings to understand how to change molecular parameters in making advances in polymer processing. There are several offshoots to reptation theory as well that are beginning to be adopted in industry. Yet, recent work has appeared that is being strongly advanced to challenge this paradigm. It has reported strong flow instabilities which would invalidate the reptation theory in the regime relevant to polymer processing. Hence establishing whether or not the reported flow instabilities occur in industrially relevant ranges of flow rates is important. The present proposal brings together collaborators from four U.S. and one foreign university (Texas Tech University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cornell University and Illinois Institute of Technology,Technical University of Eindhoven in the Netherlands) with the goal of establishing the range of experimental conditions where such flow instabilities occur. Because the general community has not uniformly accepted the reported results, the present collaboration will provide both repeat (for validation purposes) and novel experimentation to establish the range over which the reported results are relevant and how they impact the current understanding of polymer nonlinear rheology and its basis in molecular (reptation) theory. The present proposal does this. In addition, because of its structure as a collaborative work through an innovative set of student teams having one representative from at least three institutions for all experiments. All students will participate in the collaboration with the Technical University of Eindhoven."

The framework is distinguished by four phases that are performed continually with dynamically-obtained data over the lifetime of the hazardous event. (1) Measurement: Distributed sensors provide dynamic measurements over a specified time horizon that will be used to reconstruct the initial conditions of the event. (2) Inversion: Driven by the sparse measurements, an inverse problem is solved to estimate the initial conditions for the equations governing the evolution of the hazard. (3) Prediction: Statistical analysis of the inversion results permits estimation of the uncertainty in the initial conditions, which is propagated into a prediction of the evolution of the hazard and its uncertainty. (4) Steering: Sensors are steered to new locations based on an effectivity index that incorporates sensitivities of the inversion with respect to sensor location, estimated uncertainty in the prediction, and population density factors. Continual application of the measure-invert-predict-steer (MIPS) framework described above results in updated predictions of the evolving hazard with built-in uncertainty estimates, as well as revised sensor deployment strategies that refine the predictions to reduce their uncertainty. The methods developed consider two time scales of decision making at which the MIPS framework must execute. The seconds-to-minutes decision-making scale is required by first responders to begin immediate response efforts. For such time scales, high-fidelity models in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) are too formidable. Instead, the proposed methods will construct reduced-order models of the PDEs to facilitate realtime execution of the MIPS framework. The minutes-to-hours decision-making scale permits more careful and measured response by emergency officials using high-fidelity, high-resolution PDE models. To enable rapid execution of the MIPS cycle for such models, the project will develop fast, scalable, parallel algorithms for inversion and prediction. To demonstrate, assess, harden, robustify, and the resulting framework, will be validated on a specific application testbed: prediction of the urban/regional dispersion of intentionally- or accidentally-released atmospheric contaminants from sparse measurements."

Worldwide, agriculture also relies upon bee pollination, which plays a central role in many economically important crops. Increased destruction of bee-friendly habitat and declines in honey bee populations have led to interest in other bee pollinators, such as stingless bees, which have a key role in preserving native plant diversity and agriculture. However, little is known about how stingless bees influence plant gene flow by where they choose to forage. In particular, the role of competition, aggression, and interceptive eavesdropping (the ability of some stingless bee species to intercept foraging information intended for nestmates) on flower visitation and pollination are not well understood.  The researchers will combine field studies of stingless bee foraging and mathematical modeling to determine how these foraging patterns vary with foraging strategy and how competition among stingless bees can change foraging patterns. Their results will increase our understanding of how interceptive eavesdropping shapes bee foraging and contribute to mathematical models useful for preserving native plant diversity and the management of these alternative agricultural pollinators. The research will also allow minority and underprivileged students to gain direct field research experience and provide outreach teaching the importance of native pollinators and the scientific method through the web and science workshops."

In such habitats, plants and animals must possess extreme adaptations. Many species of Eryngium occupy Californian vernal pools; these plants are closely related to carrots and parsnips. In this study, adaptations in Eryngium will be viewed from a historical perspective. DNA sequences will be collected from related species of Eryngium from California, Oregon, and Chile -- some restricted to vernal pools and some from normal terrestrial habitats. Relationships between these plants will be reconstructed from their DNA sequences. This history will give insights into how a specific adaptation, seasonal changes in leaf form, may have arisen. In Eryngium, as well as other vernal-pool plants, two types of leaves are produced: (1) winter leaves, which are well suited to flooded environments but as a trade-off produce less energy than (2) summer leaves, which are poorly suited to winter flooding. An experiment will be conducted to determine if the shift from winter leaves to summer leaves is triggered by increases in the amount of daylight per day during spring, and to determine whether leaf development is tightly constrained by genetics or if it can respond adaptively to changing environmental conditions.<br/> An important question to biologists to be addressed is whether specialization of habitat is irreversible: If plants adapt to vernal pools, are they trapped by their success? Many species of Eryngium in the vernal pools of California are in peril, and an answer to this question along with improvements in the understanding of the life history of Eryngium will aid conservation efforts. The experiment in this study gives opportunity for underrepresented minorities to learn scientific research techniques otherwise not available to undergraduates."

GARNET institutions represent a cross-section of the higher education spectrum and include the University of Akron, University of Colorado-Boulder, California State University-Chico, North Hennepin Community College, Macalester College, and the University of North Dakota. GARNET's goals are: 1) To use two instruments, the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) and the Science Value Inventory (SVI), to investigate how aspects of the affective domain, in particular student motivation and values, vary for students in introductory physical geology; and 2) Identify if and how those aspects vary with instructor and specific aspects of the learning environments. The key hypotheses are that: 1) The affective domain is a major control on student learning; and, 2) How we teach can significantly change students' affective behavior. The outcome of this research will be pedagogical resources and strategies that guide the development of more effective introductory geoscience classes. The GARNET project results on the influence of the affective domain on geoscience learning and the pedagogical best practices identified begin to fill a largely underappreciated, little studied, yet highly significant gap in our understanding of student learning of science. The project focuses on a way to explore student learning in the geosciences that to date, has received almost no consistent attention at the college level, and no broad analysis within a single discipline. GARNET builds on an existing knowledge base in educational psychology that has been applied in a limited way to some college science classes but there is a paucity of information on the affective domain in introductory geoscience courses that hinders the potential of instructors to engage students and enhance science learning processes. The GARNET assessment plan measures outcomes that provide a foundation for subsequent research and the collaborative nature of this project has the potential to result in the creation of small teams of investigators exploring specific aspects of the affective domain. Results of the evaluation program will reveal which pedagogical strategies are most effective in creating learning environments characterized by more motivated students, with good attitudes about learning geoscience, and greater confidence in their ability to learn class material."

The majority of the effort is focused on the following four themes: (i) Differential constitutive models for viscoelastic liquids such as the Giesekus model will be used to study drops suspended in a matrix liquid and deformed by simple shear, cessation of shear, and large strain jumps. (ii) The recent development of microscale apparatuses has spawned new modeling and simulation challenges for droplet evolution in physical devices that are as small as the droplet itself. The project will investigate the effect of walls closing in on viscoelastic systems, for which novel breakup scenarios have been discovered experimentally. (iii) The motion of contact lines in liquid-liquid-solid systems will be investigated. A combination of the phase-field formulation and the volume-of-fluid height function method will be pursued. The former is more suited for resolving the physics of the contact line, but too resource intensive for use in the entire flow field. A challenge in contact line problems is how to obtain mesh independent results. Recent work has suggested the existence of a 'master curve' which can be used to determine a mesh dependent 'imposed' contact angle as a function of the desired 'macroscopic' contact angle. A specific computational application is electrowetting, which is perhaps the most widely used technique for drop actuation because of lower power consumption and because an applied voltage moves the drop without the need for pumps and valves. In this context, moving contact lines for the coupled system of hydrodynamic and Maxwell equations will be studied. (iv) Magnetic drug targeting involves using a ferrofluid drop as a drug carrier, which is guided through biological tissue to a specific location. An important quantity for feasibility is the transit time. Direct numerical simulations will be carried out for the motion of ferrofluid drops in viscous media under non-uniform magnetic fields. This project involves the mentoring of a postdoctoral research associate and the training of graduate students. Results will be disseminated at national and international conferences on mathematics, physics and engineering, and through journal publications. Cross-disciplinary and international partnerships will take place with scientists who obtain experimental data for comparison with numerical results.<br/><br/>The advantages in combining the desired properties of two different liquids to produce a new blended mixture are well known. The quality of the blend is strongly dependent on its microstructure, such as the size of the dispersed droplets and their distribution in the final product. Therefore, it is of practical importance to understand how a droplet evolves in the surrounding liquid and to predict how this is influenced by the rheological properties of each constituent fluid. This will be accomplished by performing direct numerical simulations with in-house state-of-the-art parallelized algorithms that are optimized for scalability and computational cost. The topics in this project contribute to the understanding of complex multi-scale systems that arise in recycling plastics, environmental sustainability, biomedical drug delivery, and droplet manipulation in microfluidic devices. Intensive use of computational infrastructures such as the TeraGrid will allow for quantitative comparison of mathematical models with raw experimental data."

The central idea is to use ion implantation through an AlN buffer layer to create a highly defective layer in silicon substrate, in the vicinity of the interface between the AlN buffer and silicon substrate. Reduction in strain due to the formation of the defected layer is expected to greatly reduce GaN film fracturing as well as the formation of threading dislocation defects. Preliminary results suggest that a large reduction in strain in GaN is possible using this approach. However, the fundamental mechanism responsible for such improvements is not yet understood. In this project, various ex-situ and in-situ materials characterization techniques will be used for the formulation of an understanding of the relationship between ion implantation conditions and the morphology and thickness of the epitaxially grown AlN buffer layer as well as the type and density of dislocations and film fracturing observed in the overgrown GaN layer.<br/>Non-technical: This project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance.

This collaborative project addresses materials science growth/processing research of InGaAs/GaAsSb multiple quantum wells (MQW) with related investigations aimed toward mid-IR wavelength detector applications. The nature of the band alignment allows tuning of the en-ergy gap by varying layer thickness, strain, and composition. Emphasis is placed on gaining greater understanding of the trap formation in GaInAs/GaAsSb MQWs and correlation of their formation with prototype device performance. The approach involves the use of InP to provide advantages: these include the use of compressive and tensile strained materials for flexible device design options; mature wafer foundry capabilities for processing InP-based structures; the ability to leverage advances in InP-based epi-growth over the past decade; and the ability to leverage fu-ture advances driven by InP electronics. Currently, device performance apppears limited by mid-gap traps in the absorption region; hence this work is focused on providing a more complete un-derstanding of these traps and correlating them with device performance. While the MIR photo-diode test structure used in this work has its merit from device perspectives, the basic under-standing of trap states in GaInAs, GaAsSb, and GaInAs/GaAsSb MQWs will improve our fun-damental understanding of these materials. In turn, this will help to better understand the nature of the Sb-based MQW structure. Additionally, these MQWs also impact other important devices such as heterojunction bipolar transistors and mid-IR semiconductor lasers. <br/>Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of elec-tronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. Societal benefits of the pro-posed research of these materials are potentially broad since the materials and prototype devices being studied support civilian and military applications including pollution detection, medical di-agnostics, night vision, and missile tracking. At present, the best detectors are based on band-to-band transitions in HgCdTe or quantum-well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) using III-V com-pound semiconductors. Neither technology is well-suited for operation at or near room-temperature. An important advantage of InGaAs/GaAsSb MQW detectors is the potential for high detectivity at relatively high temperatures (200-300K). Through their participation in state-of-the-art research both graduate and undergraduate students will gain invaluable skills and better understand the connection between materials growth, characterization, device design, and device fabrication. To show the impact of mid-IR photodiodes on applications, the photodiodes devel-oped will be used in a trace-gas monitoring demonstration platform. This platform will be used in outreach programs (Engineering Open House; a summer program called Introduction to Engi-neering (ITE); and ENGR 162 (UVA) and EG EG10111/10112 (Notre Dame) required first year engineering courses) designed to illustrate the societal benefits of Electrical Engineering. The goals of these outreach activities are to (i) educate the public about engineering, (ii) recruit pre-college students to pursue engineering as a career, and (iii) motivate first-year engineering students to remain in the major after their first year."

Undergraduate and graduate students form the heart of the project as they learn many new techniques and prepare for scientific careers. Beyond a better understanding of how superfluidity is different from normal fluids, the research serves an unusually broad need for scientific discovery in related systems involving deformation of metals, solar magnetic fields, geophysics of rotating flows, and high energy theory involving the Higgs field. <br/><br/>**** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT **** <br/>This award supports a project to investigate and characterize the formation and dynamics of quantized vortices in superfluid helium.

Furthermore, the project will explore the similarities and differences between quantum and classical turbulence in order to better understand both. Quantized vortices in superfluid helium serve as a model for a number of other systems, such that this project has the possibility to impact not only a number of sub-fields in condensed matter physics, but also astrophysics, solar physics, the geophysics of rotating flows, and high energy theory involving the Higgs field.

The foundation for this exploration will lie in a new Self-Consistent Spectrum (SCS) method for incorporating the transport into stellar evolution calculations. At the heart of the SCS method is a pair of numerical codes: a non-radial, non-adiabatic pulsation code, which will be developed as part of the project's initial activities, and an evolution code, which will be derived from an already-existing code. As massive stars evolve across the main sequence, they pass through one or more instability strips where oscillation modes are excited by an opacity-regulated heat engine. During these phases, the unstable modes can alter a star's rotation profile by transporting angular momentum from one part of the interior to another. This wave transport has potentially far-reaching consequences for the star's subsequent evolution and ultimate fate, but in studies so far it has largely been overlooked. The SCS method will first be used to explore various wave-transport phenomena discovered during an earlier pilot study: the self-limitation of mode amplitudes via the angular velocity gradients that they establish; the acceleration of surface layers by retrograde gravity modes, and its relation to the Be-star phenomenon; and the mixing of molecular weight gradient zones due to the interplay between wave transport and shear instability. Subsequently, the method will be applied in a comprehensive survey of massive-star evolution with the full inclusion of wave transport. <br/><br/>This survey, based around the calculation of a large grid of evolutionary tracks, will be used to address many important questions relating to the wave transport, ranging from its observational diagnostics through to its impact on final evolutionary outcomes. The project results will be disseminated in the form of journal papers, presentations, calculation data, parametric models, and a browser-based stellar evolution code for research and education. The pulsation code will be released under an open-source license, to encourage other groups' involvement in exploring wave transport, and also as an analysis tool for asteroseismology of massive stars. A graduate student and postdoctoral researcher composing part of the project team will benefit from training in topics with steadily growing scientific visibility and relevance. This training will in turn stimulate the development of new curriculum materials for undergraduate/graduate courses. The project results will be broadly disseminated through papers, presentations, data and models. Moreover, with the release of source code and the development of on-line tools, the project will enhance infrastructure for research and education."

A competing effect is mixing engendered by shear instabilities. This project will develop a mathematical methodology for the study of the evolution of fully nonlinear sheared, stratified flows, with the goal to understand and model the dynamics leading to fluid mixing. The wave and shear-generated mixing will be addressed with tools in the theory of systems of finite and infinitely many conservation laws. We shall calculate and study exact nonlinear solutions that break - especially simple waves of the system, general criteria for the nonlinear stability of systems of mixed type, and the statistical description of incomplete systems, based on the maximization of a coarse-grained mixing entropy.<br/><br/>This research is concerned with the propagation of waves and the dynamics of shear in atmospheric and oceanic flows and how these phenomena mix the fluid in which they exist. Mixing in geophysical flows is a crucial component of climate dynamics. The rate of mixing of ocean waters, for instance, determines the temperature at the surface, which communicates directly with the atmosphere, affecting our weather and climate. The dispersion and mixing of chemicals, carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere, on the other hand, has a profound effect on the radiative balance leading to predictions for climate change. Waves are also an element of atmospheric teleconnection: they can have long range effects since they carry energy over long distances without transporting the fluid itself. Since the length scales in which the waves and the mixing processes occur are too small and fast to be computed together with planetary scale flows, they are nowadays represented by a low number of aggregate parameters (parameterized) using simple criteria. A better understanding of the dynamics and mixing processes will improve these parameterizations and the reliability of the climate models that use them."

Manufacturing processes are inherently imprecise, producing products that vary in geometry. The geometry variation detrimentally impacts not only the fitness of the final assembly, but also in many cases the functionalities of the final product. In this research, we will model and analyze the variation propagation in periodic structure from the manufactured part geometry to its dynamic response and then to provide guidelines on mitigating the undesirable dynamic response via controlling the mean and variation of part geometry. The proposed methodology includes variation propagation analysis in two directions: (i) In the forward prediction, the geometry variation of the manufactured products is characterized based on dense measurements, and then the probabilistic distributions of the dynamic responses are computed. (ii) In the backward analysis, using the abnormal dynamic response as input, a group of local geometric features that, upon modification, can mitigate the undesirable dynamic response are identified. <br/>If successful, this research will positively impact a variety of periodic structural products, including bladed-disks in aero-engines and power generation equipment, cutting tools in high speed machining, and space antenna, etc. Through the collaboration with General Electric, this research will directly benefit a host of industries such as aerospace, automotive and manufacturing industries where these periodic structures are used. Through its integrated research, education and outreach activities, this project will provide advanced knowledge in variation propagation and reduction for students from high schools to graduate schools and will enhance domestic students? interest in science and engineering and therefore strengthen our competitiveness in the global workforce."

Unfortunately, there is no way to measure these processes directly at continental scales, which limits our ability to predict future climate and even short-term weather. The United States' collection of Earth-observing satellites gives a nearly complete view of the global biosphere every day, but this picture is so coarse that it can be difficult to interpret. A technique has been developed in this researcher's laboratory to infer the sizes and numbers of trees in coarse satellite imagery, using the shadows cast by trees. The concept is that bigger trees and denser forests cast larger shadows, which can make a forest appear darker. The algorithm, i.e. list of well-defined instructions for interpreting the satellite data, depends critically on the relationship between crown size and tree density for typical forest stands. The U.S. Forest Service has amassed an extraordinary dataset of tree architecture (size and shape) by species for forests in the continental U.S., but data are lacking for other parts of the world, especially tropical regions. This research in Hawaii will use a state-of-the art airborne system laser system to measure tree crowns, and thereby dramatically expand our understanding of forest structure in tropical regions. <br/><br/>The results of this study will allow better interpretation of daily coarse-resolution satellite imagery for improved weather and climate forecasting, and for monitoring large-scale changes in forest biomass.

The long-term goal of the proposal is to make it possible to predict the phase behavior of protein solutions and to learn to control protein self-assembly. There are three immediate objectives: (1) To determine the phase behavior of several globular proteins by light-scattering methods. The PI expects to provide comprehensive experimental evidence for the universal nature of protein phase behavior. (2) To construct realistic models for protein interactions. The PI will construct computationally tractable models with sufficient detail to capture the complexity of protein interactions. (3) To investigate new ways to control protein self-assembly. The PI will pursue our recent discovery that precipitant chirality can radically alter the crystallization of globular proteins. The governing hypothesis behind this work is that the phase behavior is controlled by a few parameters. One aim of the proposed work is to provide experimental evidence for this hypothesis. That is, there will be an attempt to determine the universal features of protein phase behavior. The experimental findings will be used to construct simple microscopic models for protein interactions that can describe the phase behavior. It will then become possible to predict the phase behavior of a protein from a few experimental measurements. The immediate impact of this work would be to greatly simplify studies involving proteins. Crystallizing proteins for structure determination would no longer depend so heavily on laborious trial and error, but instead would be based on a more precise approach that uses the phase diagram. This work will be done in the context of an RUI grant, involving undergraduate students in all aspects of a project that advances the frontiers of protein science.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: The research on globular protein phase transitions detailed in this proposal will contribute towards long-term goals of establishing systematic means of producing protein crystals for structural studies, of constructing predictive theories of phase transitions in living cells and organisms, of providing for rational design of processes of importance in the biotechnology and food-processing industries, and of creating new and useful paradigms in statistical physics. The PI is among the first faculty to be hired at Yeshiva with a mandate to introduce a research component to the campus. His effectiveness in this role is demonstrated by two publications in the past year based on research done by undergraduates in his lab. He is developing new courses in Introductory Physics for Biology Students and Premedical Students, an intermediate level lecture/lab course in Waves and Optics for Science and Engineering majors, and an advanced Biophysics reading/lab course using the English tutorial approach. He is also faculty advisor to the Undergraduate Student Research Presentation forum, a biweekly meeting at which undergraduates present the results of their research projects. Finally, he is the organizer of a periodic lecture series for general audiences that seeks to explain the work behind the Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Literature, Economics, Physiology, Medicine, and Peace."

Rates of divorce and non-marital childbearing have increased; gay and lesbian partnerships and families have also gained greater acceptance. The courts have played a crucial role in defining parenthood, particularly in the adversarial context of child custody disputes. While researchers have examined how parental gender or sexual orientation affects custody decisions, this dissertation will fill a significant gap by examining how both the gender and sexual orientation of the parent affects judicial constructions of parenthood in child custody decisions. Using a legal research database, the investigator has determined the universe of state-level judicial opinions regarding gay, lesbian, and bisexual parents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia from 1996 through 2008. These 175 cases were then matched to similar child custody cases involving heterosexual parents, resulting in 350 total court cases. A qualitative textual analysis of these 350 cases will be completed comparing both heterosexual and homosexual parents as well as both mothers and fathers. This research will study to two research questions: In judicial custody decisions of same-sex parents and heterosexual parents, how does the gender and sexuality of the parent play a role in the courts' constructions of ""parent"" and ""family?"" In a comparison of mothers to fathers, as well as gay and lesbian parents to heterosexual parents, do any meaningful differences or similarities emerge? The courts hold enormous power to influence the cultural definitions of family and this research will help us understand how courts draw the boundary lines of legal parenthood. Findings will provide important insights into understanding power and inequality in the family, which have real consequences for American families. In addition, through scholarly presentations and articles, the investigator will disseminate the research to a broader audience, including policymakers, legal professionals, and family practitioners. Finally, this study will inform future child custody policy, child support policy, and other policies that affect families."

This national research site provides an excellent opportunity to study the spatial and temporal variability associated with various biogeochemical processes and samples from the aquifer will be used to investigate the metabolic fate of contaminants under defined ecological conditions. In order to accomplish these goals, the course is structured to include a mixture of field- and laboratory-related exercises. In the laboratory, the students will learn through a combination of practical lectures, hands-on exercises that introduce the techniques of molecular biology as applied to environmental matrices, and one-on-one consultation with distinguished experts in the field of environmental microbiology and biotechnology.<br/><br/>The course will cover an array of chemical, microbiological, and molecular techniques for the analyses of soils, sediments and waters. Formal instruction and laboratory activities will be augmented by seminars from distinguished scientists who will cover a research area related to what the students are doing in the course. These scientists will also interact with the students outside the classroom environment to promote discussions and learning in less formal situations. Lastly, the project will have substantive broader impacts. One of the central tenets of the project is to bring together young scientists in a forum that will set the groundwork for future collaborative interactions. The effort is to differentially select the finest next generation scholars, equip them with the requisite training and skills, so that their common scientific background will allow them to collaborate on future environmental problems. In addition, they will pass this information on to their charges when they are in future influential positions. There will be no doubt that the biotechnological techniques and ecological lessons learned in the course will be readily extrapolated to other ecosystems across the globe."

The microstructural niche requires that the structure of the bioreactor core mimic the essential features of the microenvironment in which stem cells reside and differentiate to form liver cells and tissue. The research approach involves dividing the microstructural niche into a series of lengthscales and then recreating these scales using a unique organ casting process in which a polymer copy of a natural liver vascular network is created and then ceramic foam is cast around it. When the ceramic is fired the vascular network of the liver is retained in the open ceramic foam that will be used to culture liver cells. The deliverables include: an understanding of the effect of the vascular structure on the processing of the ceramic foam and its consequent effect on culturing of liver cells, a test of the microstructural niche concept and engineering student education.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of the research will provide a new generation of bioreactors that can culture cells and tissue from stem cells at physiologic densities. The liver cells and tissue manufactured in this way could be used in drug testing or transplant. Also, larger bioreactors of this type could be used to support liver function in patents that are being bridged to liver transplant. This award will also demonstrate an interdisciplinary approach that combines knowledge of cellular processes in tissue with the structure-property relationships of materials to design and manufacture bioreactors for other cells and tissue products. The educational approach will attract both undergraduate and graduate students to major in materials science and engineering by providing an example of a strong connection between materials engineering and the requirements of important biomedical devices for regenerative medicine."

These effects can beyond the habitat where the invasion occurs extend. The goal of this research is to evaluate the effects of an invasive non-native tree species (Russian olive, Elaeagnus angustifolia) on aquatic ecosystem processes. Unlike the native riparian vegetation that it replaces, Russian olive is able to fix nitrogen (N) transforming it into a form usable by itself and other plants. As a result, Russian olive trees can supply N to streams, altering nutrient uptake and algal growth. This altered processing of N in streams could result in greater export of N from invaded watersheds to downstream systems which could result in nutrient pollution problems. Research funded by this award will evaluate if this effect of Russian olive is manifested at a regional scale by comparing measurements of nitrogen input and biological demand for N in 10 invaded and 10 non-invaded streams in the Intermountain-West region. <br/><br/>Little is known about how invasive species affect the exchange of nutrients and food sources to adjacent ecosystems. If Russian olive alters N processing in streams this could represent a major unforeseen effect of riparian plant invasions. The results from this research will inform management of Russian olive which is in its infancy, despite the invasion's extent and potential impacts. The investigators will include undergraduate researchers and will mentor a high school intern from the nearby Shoshone-Bannock reservation where some of this work will be conducted. This study will address water quality and human health concerns affecting rural communities in the West.

One part of the proposed work seeks to obtain a fundamental understanding of the interplay between microstructure and the fraction of same chain contacts, or self-concentration, in hydrogen bonded polymer blends.

Infrared bands and Raman lines are sensitive to local environment and picosecond scale dynamics. The extent to which useful information can be obtained from the spectra of polymers will be evaluated by comparing the results of band shape analysis to those obtained by applying ultrafast two-dimensional infrared spectroscopic (2D-IR) techniques. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The factors that govern both the mixing of polymer materials and so-called relaxation phenomena (which govern their mechanical and rheological behavior) is of considerable practical importance. Finding polymers that mix at the molecular level (most do not) can lead to materials with novel properties. Even polymers that phase-separate can have important properties, such as enhanced impact resistance, providing that the size of the phase separated domains are controlled. This research will use infrared spectroscopy to study both specific interactions and relaxation behavior in polymers and their mixtures. The work will also contribute to education through the mechanism of involving both undergraduate and graduate students in laboratory work, thus teaching them the fundamentals of spectroscopic and other techniques. More uniquely, work supported on previous NSF awards that resulted in CD based monographs, complete with animations and interactive programs, will be extended to produce sets of lectures that will be freely accessible over the web."

Among <br/>those representations, the ones that are geometric, in the sense of Fontaine <br/>and Mazur, are especially of arithmetic significance, and their category<br/>should be equivalent to the (still conjectural) category of mixed motives <br/>over F. It is important to understand the first Ext groups in that category<br/>(higher Ext groups should be zero) and Bloch and Kato have made precise <br/>conjectures relating the dimension of those groups to the order of <br/>L-functions at integers values of the variable. The project aims to construct <br/>as much extensions as possible in those Ext groups (hopefully as much as <br/>predicted by the conjecture, in the case corresponding to the center of the <br/>functional equation of the L-function) using p-adic deformations of <br/>non-tempered automorphic forms. An important step should be the study of <br/>the local geometry of the ""moduli space of p-adic automorphic forms"" called <br/>Eigenvarieties around the non-tempered automorphic forms.<br/><br/><br/>Many old problems in arithmetic, some of them going back as far as <br/>Diophantes, as well as some new ones, fit well in the framework of Galois <br/>theory: they often can be translated into questions about existence, or <br/>non-existence, of certain Galois representations (that is representations of the <br/>absolute Galois group G of the field Q of rational numbers, or of some open <br/>subgroups of G) with prescribed properties. And then, sometimes, they can <br/>be proven, as was Fermat's Last Theorem by Wiles. The study of Galois <br/>representations splits up into two parts : finding irreducible Galois <br/>representations, and then determining extensions between them. Even if the <br/>first problem is far from being solved, precise conjectures about the second <br/>one were made by Bloch and Kato. The projects aims to give partial answers <br/>to those conjectures, by constructing some interesting extensions. The method <br/>uses the theory of automorphic forms, which was once quite a different topic, <br/>but which is now strongly tied to the theory of Galois representations by the<br/>Langland's program. The idea is that one can obtain interesting extensions of <br/>Galois representations by looking at (p-adic) deformations of some very <br/>special automorphic forms, the so-called non tempered forms. The more <br/>deformations there are, the more extensions one should be able to construct. <br/>Those deformations are encoded in the geometry of a (p-adic) variety, known <br/>as the Eigenvariety, and developing tools to study that geometry is an important <br/>part in the project."

Sobolev and Poincare inequalities are classical examples of such inequalities, properties like non-exactness or Kazhdan's property (T) can also be viewed as generalized isoperimetric conditions. The main objective of the project is to broaden the understanding of isoperimetric inequalities with coefficients in a C*-algebra on which the group acts by automorphisms and of their geometric implications. In particular, the problem of finding explicit, natural examples of groups carrying such inequalities will be addressed. This will lead to a better understanding of the geometry which lies behind recent progress towards the Novikov and the Baum-Connes conjectures in which exactness and a-T-menability played major roles. <br/><br/>The isoperimetric problem is one of the most fundamental problems in mathematics dating back to antiquity. In its simplest form it amounts to finding the largest area on the plane enclosed by a closed curve of fixed length. This classical case has been studied extensively and has numerous applications in analysis and geometry. It is therefore natural to ask for generalizations in which ""area"" and ""perimeter"" are replaced by more flexible notions, allowing to implement ideas from the classical case to a more demanding setting. These problems lie at the intersection of several major branches of mathematics and one of the main goals of this project is to foster interactions between the underlying algebraic, analytic and geometric structures.<br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."

The first concerns networks of coupled biological oscillators and excitable elements driven by fluctuating external stimuli.  The goal is to elucidate, within a class of biologically-relevant architectures, the relation between a network's structure and the reproducibility, or reliability, of its response.  The second project concerns the emergence of macroscopic transport processes when an open system is coupled to unequal heat reservoirs at its boundaries.  This project focuses on a prototypical class of models that includes both deterministic and stochastic microscopic dynamics.  The aim here is to gain insights into the properties of nonequilibrium steady states in a concrete class of model systems.  The third project aims to develop efficient numerical algorithms for computing statistical averages, e.g., Lyapunov exponents, that are frequently used to characterize nonlinear dynamical systems.  The algorithms to be developed are based on exploiting approximate prior knowledge of the quantity to be computed, e.g., approximate knowledge of the system's invariant measure.  This will be done via coupling multiple simulations of the system in question, and to use such couplings to produce unbiased estimators with potentially significantly smaller variance.  The efficacy of the algorithms in various biological and physical settings, including the projects outlined above, will be investigated.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems with many strongly nonlinear degrees of freedom arise in many scientific and technological problems.  Their analysis and simulation is often difficult because of the complexity of their interactions and their often chaotic dynamics.  The projects comprising this work seek to understand such large dynamical systems in some specific settings, and to develop general, efficient numerical algorithms for computing relevant statistical properties of nonlinear dynamical systems.  The expected outcome of this research may lead to deeper insights into a range of phenomena, including the ability of biological neural networks to encode information and the emergence of macroscopic energy and matter transport in spatially-extended systems with complex microscopic interactions.  The algorithms to be developed are potentially applicable to other application domains, e.g., stochastic chemical kinetics.  It is expected that the projects will lead to interdisciplinary collaborations, e.g., with biological scientists, and to opportunities for graduate student training."

As a powerful clinical evaluation tool, this system also benefits the current study of knee injury prevention and rehabilitation. Among those injuries, the knee is one of the most easily injured body areas, with injuries to the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) as the most frequent problem overall followed by the PatelloFemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS).

The objective of this project is to understand the mechanism by which crazing is initiated in thermosetting epoxy polymers by the addition of functionalized carbon nanotubes. To this end, the effect of structural changes induced by these nanotubes on the cure chemistry of the epoxy will be studied. The relationship between these structural changes and the mechanism of crazing will be established. Furthermore, the effect of multiscale static and dynamic stress heterogeneities on the mechanical response of the material will be studied. An ability to control crazing in thermosetting epoxies could significantly enhance their toughness and ductility without reducing their mechanical strength. Given the widespread use of epoxies in structural applications this is expected to translate into significant practical applications. <br/><br/>The results of this work will provide a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which functionalized carbon nanotube additives can initiate crazing in thermosetting epoxies. This can lead to the development of a new class of nanocomposite thermosetting polymers with significantly enhanced toughness, ductility and fatigue resistance, while at the same time enhancing the strength and stiffness of the polymer. A variety of applications involving thermosetting epoxies such as paints, coatings, adhesives, industrial tooling, composites as well as the semi-conductor and electronics packaging industries will benefit from this research.

However, the role of rainfall on surface fluxes, the dynamics of surface waves, the surface ocean , and the marine atmosphere boundary layer have not been studied in detail. A significant percentage of the shear stress at the ocean surface may be provided, at low wind speed, by rainfall. In addition, moderate rains will produce a dissipation of kinetic energy that is similar in magnitude to dissipations that are measuring in the surface-wave zone under breaking wave conditions. Higher rain rates cause much higher amounts of dissipation and thus significant amounts of mixing of the ocean surface can occur. This has important implications for gas, momentum and heat transfer between the atmosphere and the ocean. Rainfall also impacts the interpretation of surface-ocean remote sensing. There has been little work to date on the assessing the impact of rain. In this project, scientists from the University of Delaware and Columbia University, will conduct laboratory experiments to determine the amount of turbulent mixing and momentum transfer that occurs from the rain, investigate the dynamic effect of rain-induced stress on surface waves and examine the impact of rainfall on air-water gas transfer rates. Parameters such as rain rate, droplet size, wind speed, shear and turbulence will be measured to determine the mechanisms which cause significant mixing and also to explore the coupling between surface fluxes that are induced by rain and those that are induced by wind. In addition, the dynamic effects of rain-induced stresses on the surface waves will be investigated. The study has several important broader impacts. An improved understanding of how rain influences air-sea interactions will facilitate the improvement of parameterizations of these processes in models of the weather and climate.

The Tunneling Level Systems (TLS) model can successfully describe this behavior below 1K but the physical mechanism that gives rise to the TLS has yet to be identified. Amorphous silicon is a unique system in that silicon?s tetrahedral bonding is predicted to preclude the presence of TLS yet the density of these states is found to vary by orders of magnitude; from the densities typically found in glasses to almost undetectable levels. Light soaking can increase the density of TLS and the presence of TLS has been linked to the decrease in efficiency of amorphous silicon solar cells over time. In this project, we will use the unique ability to tune the density of TLS in amorphous silicon, both by preparation conditions and light soaking, to systematically probe the origin of the thermodynamic universality. In particular, we will measure the low temperature specific heat and thermal conductivity and look for correlations to changes in the local bonding in the amorphous matrix. Identifying the mechanism that gives rise to the TLS has a direct impact on quantum information processing where the TLS give rise to decoherence in qubits and also to the use of amorphous silicon as a low cost photovoltaic material.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>This project will investigate the thermodynamic properties of amorphous vapor deposited films. Amorphous materials exhibit a characteristic set of thermodynamic behaviors that differ substantially from their crystalline counterparts. This universal behavior includes: low temperature properties (below ~1K) that are explained by the model of tunneling level states (TLS); higher temperature properties which include excess heat capacity C (well above what is calculated from sound velocity), a ?boson peak?, and a plateau in thermal conductivity k. The focus will be on a-Si and a-Si:H films where changes in growth conditions and H content are known to reduce the density of TLS that give rise to these universal properties at low temperature. Dangling bond passivation with H will be probed via FTIR and these results will be coupled with EXAFS and XANES measurements to see how the local structural order of the amorphous matrix correlates to any changes in the specific heat. Specific heat measurements will be made with a MEMS based nanocalorimeter that is specifically designed for thin films. Comparisons between as deposited, light soaked, and annealed films will be made to further our understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to the light induced degradation of the efficiency of a-Si photovoltaic devices known as the Staebler-Wronski Effect. The project will provide research training and education for two graduate students and an estimated 5-6 undergraduates, including exposure to the national laboratories through the PI's collaborations with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory."

Lovinger	06/30/2011	"$260,000.00"		ediger@chem.wisc.edu	21 North Park Street	MADISON	WI	537151218	6082623822	MPS	1773	"9161, AMPP"	$0.00	"TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Measurements of molecular mobility in polymer glasses during active deformation will be performed. Recent results show that stress can increase segmental mobility in a glass by more than a factor of 1000. This suggests that plastic flow should be understood as stress creating sufficient segmental mobility that the glass effectively is transformed into a very viscous liquid. From this perspective, understanding how stress creates mobility in a glass is the key issue that must be addressed in order to develop better predictions of polymer glass deformation. In this work, segmental mobility will be measured during the deformation of polymethylmethacrylate, polycarbonate, polystyrene, and a fully cured Epon epoxy resin. In addition to single step tensile creep measurements, multistep creep and constant strain-rate measurements will be performed. Previous mechanical experiments have shown an important influence of the thermal and mechanical history of polymer glasses on their subsequent deformation; aging a glass, for example, can transform a ductile response to brittle failure. It is anticipated that these phenomena are all controlled or significantly influenced by stress-induced mobility and this view will be tested with measurements of molecular mobility during deformation after various aging times. Collectively these experiments will provide new insights into the dynamics of polymer glasses and provide data needed to develop better predictions of polymer glass deformation.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Polymer glasses are important materials and, for some applications, their ability to deform significantly without breaking is a critical attribute. This work will measure how deformation accelerates the rate at which polymer chains can move in glass; this information is needed to make accurate predictions about how polymer glasses will deform in a wide range of applications. This work may have a significant economic and environmental impact because of the broad use of polymeric materials. As an example, measurements of mobility changes during the deformation of an epoxy resin should be directly relevant to the development of advanced composites needed to manufacture lighter, more efficient aircraft. In addition, the funding of this proposal will advance the training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students through the integration of materials research and education activities. The scientists and students supported by this grant will work with the University of Wisconsin-Madison?s PEOPLE program to prepare high school students from under-represented groups for college. Each summer, those supported by this grant will staff a thirty-hour polymer materials course for 15 high school juniors. The PEOPLE program has a proven track record of preparing students to succeed in college; currently, the University of Wisconsin-Madison has more than 220 undergraduates who are graduates of the PEOPLE program. In collaboration with a high school science teacher, modules from the polymer materials summer course will be modified for use in Wisconsin public high schools."

These organisms are of interest to biologists not only because they have interesting evolutionary histories but also as intermediate hosts of disease-causing parasites. The lowest reach of the Congo is punctuated by numerous powerful rapids, and it is expected that these cataracts constitute barriers to aquatic dispersal and therefore contribute to the endemic diversity of the area. Through sampling expeditions to the Lower Congo, the specimens collected for this research can be used to test hypotheses of evolutionary relationships and biogeographic processes, both at the population level and among species on a continent-wide scale. The result will be a clearer understanding of the origin and maintenance of biological diversity in western Africa.<br/> The data and conclusions generated by this research will not only be made available through traditional media but will also take advantage of modern means of dissemination, especially the internet (http://www.mussel-project.net/). An important component of the internet presence for this project will be the use of powerful database technology to provide searching and browsing interfaces into the data and conclusions, with multiple points of entry. The target audience for this research is not only scientists and conservation officials; these results will also serve teachers, students and all members of the public interested in better understanding their world. Besides providing a novel scientific perspective on an interesting, important but poorly known fauna, this study will also serve to train up-and-coming biologists including Congolese faculty and students through hands-on research experience."

The last decade has seen the emergence and commercialization of on-line control loop performance-monitoring techniques. The primary objectives of any performance-monitoring tool can be categorized as: (i) detection of performance degradation, (ii) diagnosis of the cause for performance degradation, and (iii) corrective action. While the first objective has been addressed comprehensively in the literature, work on the other two objectives is lacking. In this project, the focus will be on oscillation diagnosis, stiction detection, and stiction compensation. Quantitative and qualitative techniques will be explored for solving these problems. Through industrial collaboration with Honeywell, all the techniques that are developed will be extensively validated on one million industrial control loops.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/><br/>Shape-based and model-based algorithms will be developed for stiction diagnosis. The scalability issues in the deployment of these algorithms will be studied through benchmarking on a million industrial control loop dataset. The development of both model-free and model-based stiction-compensation algorithms are envisaged. Preliminary results suggest that highly optimal compensation signals can be designed with benign valve movements for stiction compensation. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/><br/>This work will generate tools that can be leveraged by the US process industries to maintain their competitive edge. Results arising out of the project will provide Honeywell with a performance assessment tool that can be benchmarked on a large database of loop data and subsequently implemented on a wide variety of control loops. It has been estimated that detection and diagnosis of control loop degradation alone could reduce energy cost of the overall process industry by 1% which could amount to as much as $300 million per year. This could be a driving force for other control vendors to embrace and develop their own controller performance monitoring tools. The dissemination activities include: publication in archival journals, presentation at conferences targeted at academicians and industry participants, and inclusion of material in a book on fault diagnosis that the PI is co-authoring. A laboratory experiment will be upgraded at Clarkson University and will be used to teach undergraduate students the concept of Controller Performance Assessment. The PI will work closely with Clarkson's Pipeline of Education Program to recruit talented underrepresented students from universities with which Clarkson has established articulation agreements and/or memorandums of understanding."

This project addresses the epitaxial growth of high crystalline quality InGaN across the complete composition range. The aim is to gain greater understanding of the properties of the miscibility gap and to explore methods that can consistently provide single phase InGaN films. Theoretical studies suggest that phase separation in layers having the interface oriented parallel to the c-axis (such as a- or m-plane InGaN) is dramatically suppressed. Thus, the approach is to develop MOCVD processes for the growth of InGaN epilayers on a-plane through different epilayer templates (AlN, GaN, and InN). Studies to understand fundamental effects of growth orientation and strain on the miscibility gap in InGaN are expected to lead to a new approach for achieving single phase device quality InGaN epilayers. These films will then allow for studies of fundamental optical and transport properties of InGaN in composition ranges which were previously inaccessible. Detailed studies concerning the optical and transport properties of InxGa1-xN in the miscibility gap region (0.45 < x < 0.75) have not been possible because these InxGa1-xN films generally have been of very low crystalline quality and exhibit weak or negligible photoluminescence. It is anticipated that many of the important physical properties (structural, optical, and electrical) of InxGa1-xN in the miscibility gap region will be characterized through these studies. <br/>Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. The realization of device quality InGaN epilayers over a more complete alloy range would yield significant benefits for many III-nitride based optoelectronic devices. The bandgap of InGaN expands from about 0.7 eV to 3.4 eV, which covers the entire solar spectrum. In principle, a multijunction solar cell or photoelectrochemical cell based on multi-layers of InGaN with different In-contents is highly efficient at capturing different wavelengths of the sunlight passing through the cell. InGaN alloys could also be potentially important thermoelectric (TE) materials and may be an attractive alternative to other materials for the development of TE generators that are able to directly convert heat to electricity in new generation automobiles, radioisotope TE generators in spacecraft or cooling modules for enhanced efficiency and lifetime of micro/nano-scale sensor networks. Attainment of high quality InGaN in the previously predicted miscibility gap region would also significantly benefit the development of high efficiency LEDs with wavelengths longer than 550 nm. The successful attainment of highly efficient green/yellow InGaN LEDs would then enable the technology for white LEDs through the R-G-B three color chip integration approach providing highly efficient light sources for general illumination. The bandgap of In-rich InGaN could also be engineered to match the fiber optic communication wavelength around 1.5 um. Postdoctoral and graduate students will be actively involved in a research program that is highly interdisciplinary in nature including state-of-the-art epitaxial research of photonic materials and structures to advanced materials characterization and micro/nano-scale prototype photonic/optoelectronic device research. Undergraduates will also participate in this research using Whitacre Endowment funds. Plans for education and outreach include the development of hands-on activities to be presented to teams of high school teachers and students on 'Nanophotonics' in conjunction with activities conducted by the Center of Engineering Outreach at TTU."

In both cases, the focus is on the problems in which penalized empirical risk minimization with convex loss functions and convex complexity penalties is used to define statistical estimators of target functions and in which the geometric nature of the problem plays an important role. One of the goals is to extend the theory of sparse recovery that emerged in Harmonic Analysis, Signal Processing and Statistics beyond the usual framework of finite dictionaries to include a variety of problems that are of importance in Machine Learning (in particular, in kernel machines methods and ensemble methods). Specifically, the aim is to develop a theory of sparse recovery based on penalized empirical risk minimization in large ensembles of kernel machines and in linear spans and convex hulls of infinite dictionaries. Another goal is to develop a mathematical theory of several manifold learning methods introduced in the recent years. This includes methods of statistical estimation of partial differential operators associated with a manifold, such as Laplace-Beltrami operator, based on the data sampled from this manifold. These operators are used to develop an ``approximate version'' of harmonic analysis for functions on the manifold that is of importance in nonparametric function estimation. In particular, the research focuses on the analysis of regularized estimators of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of these operators and on the development of error bounds for complexity regularized estimators in learning problems for manifold data.<br/><br/>The project is closely related to several lines of research in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science. Better understanding of subtle geometric nature of complex, high-dimensional data sets and taking it into account in the development of statistical inference for high-dimensional data are very important challenges in Statistics and Machine Learning. Sparse recovery and manifold learning are among the most important developments in these areas where the methods of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis, High-Dimensional Probability and Differential Geometry are used to study a number of challenging statistical problems. This leads to new mathematical tools and new statistical methods with potential applications in a variety of areas where the approach based on Machine Learning is crucial, such as Brain Imaging, Bioinformatics, Data and Visual Analytics. The research also benefits education by providing training opportunities for graduate students and it facilitates exchanges and collaborations between Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science."

To respond to this uncommon opportunity the University of Iowa and the University of Maryland Baltimore County propose Rapid Response Research to continue our ongoing collaborative monitoring and documentation of the forecasting process for the Red River through the spring snowmelt season. The proposed work will capture and archive key transient information needed to support future research on hydrologic forecast quality and forecast value for low-probability high-consequence events. The proposed activities will yield: (1) an archive of forecast information and operational forecast interpretation by human forecasters at the NWS, (2) an assessment of the baseline quality of forecast models and the value-added by the human forecasters, and (3) documentation of the users of these forecasts, including the participants and information flows from NWS forecast dissemination conference calls, and forecast uses institutionalized in emergency response plans."

Genetic diversity plays a central role in buffering populations against the effects of parasites and pathogens.  The ability to isolate genes related directly to disease susceptibility and understanding how those genes evolve is important for designing successful and cost-effective conservation programs.  The vast majority of such studies in wildlife have focused on the relationship between a single pathogen and one or two well-studied immune system genes.  This project goes beyond the single-pathogen single-gene approach by investigating the relationship between diversity in six immune system genes and the entire parasite community of black-tailed prairie dogs.  This research will also provide the first comprehensive survey of black-tailed prairie dog parasites on the Shortgrass Steppe Long Term Ecological Research site, and will determine if black-tailed prairie dogs are a host for West Nile virus.  <br/><br/>Prairie dogs are an important component of North American grasslands, but have declined throughout their range, primarily because of the introduced pathogen Yersinia pestis, which causes plague.  Given the social behavior of prairie dogs, they are an excellent model for studying transmission and evolution of resistance for disease like plague.  In addition to advancing the understanding of disease resistance, this project will generate important information for researchers and managers, and provide one graduate student and over 50 undergraduate students with training in laboratory and field research methods."

Additional partnerships with school districts and with a nonprofit organization are being developed as part of the planning activities. The California State University Sacramento campus prepares highly qualified mathematics and science teachers for a primarily urban service region, with a large population of low income, culturally and linguistically diverse students. In conjunction with other math and science-focused programs already in place, the planning grant is laying the groundwork for submission of a full proposal to the Teaching Fellowship/Master Teaching Fellowship track by allowing for completion of NCLB-compliant subject matter programs in the sciences, re-design of a post-baccalaureate credential program, completion of the design of a new Master of Arts degree in Biological Sciences with a concentration for science teachers, and collaboration with public school partners on revision of the 2-year induction program for new teachers to integrate a significantly enhanced disciplinary focus. In all cases, best practices from national literature on recruitment, retention, preparation, mentoring and professional development for mathematics and science teachers are being incorporated into the program design and revision activities. This planning grant project is thus adding to the discipline-based focus of teacher preparation work in two colleges, while strengthening collaborative ties between them and their math/science teacher induction colleagues. By refining the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment program to overlap with discipline-specific Masters degrees in biology and mathematics (through first steps included in the planning grant), California State University Sacramento is introducing a more rigorous, discipline-based focus in new teacher support programs for mathematics and science teachers."

While extreme value theory has always played an important role in probability and statistics, recent events such as the economic meltdown of the international banking system and the heightened threats of climate change have underscored the pressing need to develop and expand methodologies in extremes to tackle these new and critical challenges. Many of the first applications of extremes were tied to hydrology. Engineers were interested in designing dams that would cope with maximum river flow. This led naturally to the concept of a one hundred year flood. Analogues of the concept of the 100 year flood have spread to atmospheric science, where one may be interested in the 100 year rainfall, and to finance where the 100 year flood is replaced by the 10 day or 1 year VaR (value at risk). <br/><br/><br/><br/>In the last ten years there has been a rapid development of new theory and methodology in extreme value theory. This has been motivated by applications in climate and atmospheric science; geosciences; hydrology; finance, economics, and insurance; and telecommunications and stochastic networks.

The ?

Although these bacteria are transmitted maternally and must be inside of a louse to remain alive, their evolutionary tree does not mirror that of the lice they live in. This incongruity might be explained by the replacement of one group of symbionts with another group in some of the species of Columbicola. Genome sequences will be produced for the symbionts of two lice species, C. columbae and C. baculoides. These data will be used to compare the gene inventory, genome organization and genome size of the two symbionts. If the ancestral symbiont has been replaced in some species of Columbicola, then we expect that these genomic characteristics will be very different for each of the symbiont groups. The genome sequences produced from this study will be the first for symbionts of insects that feed on keratin (feathers or hair). <br/><br/>This study will improve our knowledge of symbiotic relationships, in particular the possible replacement and subsequent evolution of bacterial symbionts. In addition, this work will provide training in the fields of bioinformatics and genomics for a female PhD student and several undergraduates.

The study of maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules over such rings has grown out of the theory of representations of Artin algebras, which has developed sophisticated theoretical techniques for classifying and characterizing module theories of non-commutative Artinian rings. Classical problems from the non-commutative theory can often be stated directly in the commutative higher-dimensional framework, and this framework comes equipped with its own unique problems, specialized machinery, and deep, powerful connections with algebraic geometry. The interplay between the two areas has been exceptionally productive for both. However, many of the most powerful tools of the Artinian arsenal are essentially noncommutative, in that they produce noncommutative rings even from commutative input, restricting their use in commutative algebra. Recent theoretical advances in non-commutative algebraic geometry have begun to provide methods, including the notion of a non-commutative resolution of singularities, similar to those provided by classical algebraic geometry. Describing these non-commutative resolutions in terms of tools from the Artinian theory will allow the powerful tools of that area to be brought to bear on fundamental conjectures about the maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules over Cohen--Macaulay local rings.<br/><br/>This project lies at the intersection of the areas of commutative and non-commutative algebra, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. The classical aim of commutative algebra is to describe the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations by associating to them algebraic gadgets known as rings. Non-commutative algebra, on the other hand, has developed theory for associating rings to directed graphs, also called quivers. The synergy among these topics has enriched all four subjects, and has led to applications in such varied fields as robotics, statistics, cryptography, and particularly theoretical physics, where non-commutative methods are central to such subjects as quantum mechanics, string theory and the study of fundamental particles."

This project addresses synthesis/processing/fabrication research to explore quantum-cascade (QC) mid- and far-infrared light-emitting materials based on SiGe quantum wells (QWs). Since QC lasers are semiconductor light sources based on intersubband (ISB) transitions (i.e., electronic transitions between quantized states within the same energy band), their operation is essentially unaffected by the nature of the energy band gap of the underlying materials. Hence such considerations provide an approach for the demonstration of laser action in silicon ? a goal complicated by the indirect band gap of (Si)(Ge). Strain, however, associated with Si/SiGe QWs appears as a significant challenge to progress. This project takes a new approach, in which elasti-cally relaxed SiGe nanomembranes are used as the growth substrates and/or the active material. Such nanomembranes will be grown epitaxially on Si(Ge)-on-insulator substrates and then re-leased from the handle wafer by removing the underlying oxide layer via wet etching. The de-sired result would be a free-standing heterostructure where strain relaxation occurs via elastic strain sharing among the constituent epilayers without the formation of defects, and thus be vir-tually free of dislocations. The released nanomembranes could then be transferred onto other substrates. Further challenges complicating the demonstration of silicon-based QC lasers are provided by design issues specific to the SiGe QW materials system, which are also being ad-dressed on this project. An approach based on electronic ISB transitions in the L valleys of Ge/SiGe QWs will be explored. Recent calculations indicate that this approach may have advan-tages over the p-type structures that have been investigated so far, including longer nonradiative lifetimes, larger oscillator strengths, and more efficient tunneling transport.<br/>Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of elec-tronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. The proposed use of nanomembrane technology for the fabrication of complex semiconductor quantum structures has the potential for broad technological impact beyond the SiGe materials system and the QC-laser device application described above. Moreover, the project activities will promote education through the training of students across disciplines, ranging from semiconductor epitaxial growth to nanomembrane synthesis and processing, bandgap engineering, and THz (terahertz) photonics. To increase the effectiveness and scope of the program, the involvement of undergraduates and high-school interns will be emphasized, by leveraging existing programs with a strong focus on under-represented minorities."

This project will develop teams of mathematics and science teacher-leaders in twenty high schools, chosen on the basis of an application procedure to determine school readiness and administrative support. The key outcome of the project within schools will be teacher-led work in the selection, refinement, and implementation of rigorous 12th-grade capstone and AP curricula. In addition, teacher leaders will have new competencies to coordinate curricula across grades 9-10-11. <br/><br/>The CTTI is organized from a theoretically-focused and research-based logic model of school change, based on the idea that school capacity to carry out and sustain change requires specific inputs, including the teacher content knowledge and leadership skills that CTTI will provide to the teachers. This model describes how school capacity, with its dimensions of in-school collaboration, teacher reflection, and instructional development, directly affect both teacher practice and student outcomes. The faculty from the Universities will learn from the CPS teachers how to recruit, retain and support students from the schools. <br/><br/>The CTTI teacher program develops leaders through three different experiences: (1) recruitment and initiation of cohorts of teachers; (2) courses in interdisciplinary content and educational research (3) workshops on linking content knowledge to reform curricula and school leadership. These will be given to 80 math and 80 science teachers over four CTTI cohorts, producing robust teacher-leaders teams in 20 schools. Teachers are in one of three tracks: mathematics (80 teachers), physical science (40 teachers), or life and environmental science (40 teachers). The CTTI's specific focus on teacher content knowledge and the application of that knowledge to teaching and school leadership is enhanced by its connection to multiple universities that are themselves at the forefront of STEM research, as will be reflected in the content of the CTTI courses.<br/><br/>The project builds on a logic model that links program activities with teacher and student outcomes. The research program will coordinate with other district- and university-based studies of school reform, making use of extensive data already available in CPS, the HSTP, and the classrooms.

The structural disorder originates at the atomic scale from randomly packed atoms in proximity to each other. This disorder leads to some of the most remarkable mechanical properties that their crystalline counterparts can only envy: high strength close to the theoretical value, large elastic strain, and high toughness. Metallic glass covers a wide range of systems including transition metals, refractory metals, rare earth metals, and their alloys. These unique and superb properties make them the perfect candidates for many applications including structural components, durable and high performance equipment, coatings, and miniature devices subject to large loading, wear and corrosive protection, and precision shaping. In the past decade, extensive research and development have been done to utilize metallic glasses, especially their mechanical properties. This collaborative research is focused on probing atomic scale deformation processes and atomic structures. It combines experimental approaches using synchrotron X-ray scattering and neutron scattering, and atomistic simulations using molecular dynamics and first-principle calculations. Specifically, it addresses the following issues: (1) Atomic structures, including short- and medium-range order and their changes caused by deformation; (2) Mechanical responses and their differences for systems with different atomic structures; (3) Atomic scale characterizations of structure-mechanical responses such as free volume, local shear transformation, and local atomic bond changes that cannot be easily captured directly by experimental measurements.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this research is to establish the constitutive relations among stress, strain, strain rate, temperature and various physical, structural properties and compositional changes. Due to the difficulties posed by the structural disorder in metallic glasses, reliable constitutive relations must be built on detailed and accurate understanding of atomic scale processes and mechanisms. This effort contributes critically to the advancement of knowledge in this area. We also expect this effort to contribute a positive step in widening the applications of this marvelous material, thus gaining an edge for US industries in the highly competitive world market. Another integral part of this proposed work is the education and outreach program. The project follows two tracks in this regard: (1) participation in outreach education program for local minority engineering undergraduates and K-12 program for students interested in engineering careers through demonstrations, workshops, and hands-on learning experiences, (2) establishment of a close collaboration and exchange program between experimental and computational work for graduate students in Georgia Tech and University of Tennessee, contributing to a rich education experience for both undergraduates and graduate students."

Religion is a cultural phenomenon through which other aspects of social identity can be articulated, are negotiated, contested, and made explicit.If daily life has an effect on cultural change and ethnogenesis, as most archaeologists would argue, then the degree to which religious ideology affected daily life is an important variable. This project will evaluate the strength of religion as a structuring principle in social relations through the study of an 18th century Caribbean plantation which was home to the white landowning family, members of the Quaker religious group, and at least 7 enslaved Africans. The study site is a now uninhabited, 155 acre island near Tortola, in the British Virgin Island, ten acres of which have been identified as containing heavy 18th century habitation with excellent preservation. The study hypothesizes that religious ideology of Quakerism will alter social relations, producing observable material differences from sites where that ideology is absent, even at the expense of economic rationality. Because of the contradictions between Quaker ideology and the practice of slavery, it is predicted that religion will be most clearly identifiable archaeologically in the relationship between the Quaker owners and the enslaved Africans they held. The project will employ surface survey and focused excavations of the homes of the enslaved and the owners in order to address this question.<br/><br/>The research will serve as an integral part of Mr. Chenoweth's academic training and to the development of his expertise as a researcher."

The proposal seeks funds to continue a follow-up analytical work of deep-sea corals collected in the Drake Passage during a research cruise. The project's goal is paleo-climate research looking to constrain the depth structure and time evolution of the radiocarbon content of the Southern Ocean during the glacial and deglaciation. Radiocarbon is a versatile tracer of past climate; its radioactive decay provides an internal clock with which to assess the rates of processes, and it can be used to trace the movement of carbon through the Earth's system. It enters the ocean through air-sea gas exchange, so processes that limits this will, therefore, reduce the radiocarbon content of both surface and deep waters. The Southern Ocean is a critical location for exchange of heat and carbon between the deep-ocean and atmospheric reservoirs, and the deep waters formed there fill large volumes of the global deep and intermediate oceans. As strong currents tend to scour away sediments, carbonate preservation is limited, and radiocarbon reservoir ages are poorly constrained, many traditional paleoceanographic techniques become impractical. It is proposed to alleviate these difficulties analyzing the chemical composition of deep-sea coral skeletons. Their aragonitic skeletons can be precisely dated using U-series decay, and when coupled with radiocarbon analyses will allow to calculate the C14/C12 ratio of the past water column."

The most obvious example is the lightning that accompanies thunderstorms, tornadoes and active volcanoes. The key to this electrification is the charge separations that occur upon the breakup of water or ice surfaces. Recent experimental and theoretical advances by chemists and physicists at water and ice interfaces are opening up the possibility of understanding electrification on a molecular level. These advances have inspired a workshop to be held in Telluride, Colorado during August 10-14, 2009. Scientists from the diverse communities of engineering, chemistry, physics and physical meteorology will convene to develop a deeper understanding of the phenomena of electrification in the natural environment.<br/><br/>One conference participant will present a public lecture to a few hundred visitors and residents of Telluride. This is a regular feature of the Telluride Science Research Center, which will host the workshop. This educational outreach may inspire other participants to offer similar popular lectures in their own communities. Lightning has fairly obvious impacts on structures and anything else that it strikes. An improved understanding of water and ice electrification may also lead to insights into the influences of human activity (e.g., increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other pollutants)."

It is the second in a series of meetings dedicated to the theoretical and experimental challenges surrounding directional dark matter detection. The conference will be held at MIT from June 11-13, 2009.<br/><br/>Astrophysical observations suggest that the matter content of the Universe is dominated by nonbaryonic dark matter. Although dark matter is expected to permeate our galaxy, no dark matter particle has been unambiguously detected directly. Many groups worldwide have undertaken programs to search for the interaction of dark matter particles with baryonic matter in the laboratory. Because the interaction rates between dark matter and baryonic matter are so small, these experiments are plagued by Standard Model backgrounds. The dark matter signal, however, is astrophysical in origin, and should be separable from backgrounds if the direction of arrival is measured. This idea has prompted several international groups to pursue the development of dark matter detectors that provide directional sensitivity. <br/><br/>The goal of the CYGNUS Conference series is to bring together the international scientific community working on both theoretical and experimental aspects of directional dark matter detection and Galactic dark matter distribution, and to coordinate efforts towards a large future directional dark matter experiment. <br/><br/>For the Broader Impacts, all presentations will be archived and publicly available through the conference website so that many others can take advantage of the talks."

In the golden orb spider, Nephila clavipes, males are limited in the amount of sperm they can use over their lifetime and therefore must allocate sperm judiciously. They usually choose to mate with unmated females because the first male to mate with a virgin female fertilizes the majority of her eggs. However, a virgin female stores sperm and delays egg fertilization for up to a month, making it possible that she will die before she lays her eggs. If she dies then the male has wasted his limited sperm on this female. Rather than mate with a virgin, some males mate with a previously mated female just before she lays her eggs. This study proposes that these males are trading off reduced paternity for an increase in the chance that his mate will survive to lay eggs, a portion of which he has fertilized. Mate mortality risk could be a factor in mate choice under a variety of circumstances where reproductive pay-off is not immediate. For example, in species with paternal care, females are thought to choose mates that are in good condition because they provide more resources, but this study suggests a different reason: lower parental mortality rates that will reduce offspring abandonment. This project uses modeling, molecular and experimental approaches to evaluate this hypothesis. The investigators will measure the consequences of mating choices by males and how these consequences change over the breeding season. The project will provide undergraduate assistants with research experience in observational field methods, natural experiments, genetic analysis, and dynamic modeling. In addition, the study will contribute to the campus natural areas conservation project. Understanding the complexity of reproductive behavior is critical for conservation efforts and for maintaining biodiversity."

Through production of transgenic algae containing specific gene regulatory sequences, this research develops algal strains that conditionally express an essential chloroplast-encoded gene only in the presence of the specific inducer compound. Thus, transgenic algal strains would survive only in the presence of the inducer compound (which will be added to the ponds in our production facility). On escape from the production facility, these algae will stop production of the essential target protein and be unable to reproduce in the environment. This biosecure production system will allow the use of genetically modified algae in open pond production systems without fear of impacting the surrounding systems. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed research will be to enable the use of low cost, open-pond culturing systems for the production of biofuels using microalgae genetically manipulated for maximum oil and biomass production. This will be accomplished in a biosecure manner through the development of molecular biological strategies that prevent the genetically manipulated algal strains from reproducing once they are removed from the production ponds. The use of molecular genetics to both increase the production of oil and ensure biosecure use of the transgenic algae (unable to replicate in the surrounding environment) could enable cost effective production of biofuels using algal systems.<br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."

To form tissues, limbs and organs, these cells divide, move and change their shape to form a healthy individual. An organism's genetic program instructs its cells to adopt certain characteristics and the cells respond appropriately. The central goal of Dr. Minden's laboratory is to understand the connection between the genetic program and cell behavior. Cell movement is controlled by a large number of proteins collectively referred to as the cytoskeleton, the molecular equivalent to bones and muscles. Cytoskeletal proteins are used by all cells to regulate their shape, and developmental biologists study how cell shape changes lead to the formation of particular tissues in the embryo. Dr. Minden's laboratory is particularly interested in how cells first decide to form muscles and immune cells of fruit flies. To study how these cells change their shape without affecting other cells, he has devised a laser-dependent scheme to inactivate specific cytoskeletal proteins at the precise time at which cell shape changes take place. These studies will identify proteins required for cell shape changes, and this method will be broadly applicable to the analysis of cell behavior in a wide variety of experimental organisms.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this work resides in its interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students. This research involves chemistry, biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, genetics, state-of-the-art microscopy, image analysis and proteomics to address longstanding questions in cell and developmental biology. To date, his laboratory has used its previous government funding to train over 50 undergraduates, 14 graduate students and 8 postdoctoral fellows from the departments of biology, chemistry, mathematics, statistics, computer science, robotics, and biomedical engineering.

Lian Yu, Mark Ediger, and Juan de Pablo of the University of Wisconsin ? Madison, Dr. Geoff Zhang of Abbott Laboratories, and their research student colleagues will investigate the crystallization of organic glasses. Glasses are liquids that are too cold to flow. According to the current view that crystallization is controlled by diffusion, organic glasses should not crystallize readily. Yet recent work has shown that many do crystallize, sometimes at rates 105 times faster than predicted by the standard models. This study concerns two modes of crystal growth activated near the glass transition temperature: a bulk mode and a surface mode. Both growth modes are too fast to be controlled by bulk diffusion. The team will test the hypothesis that molecular motions native to the glassy state can cause crystal growth, without involving substantial bulk diffusion, if sufficient similarity exists between the crystal and liquid structures. They will determine whether crystal growth in the glassy state becomes faster if bulk molecular motions are amplified with an external field. They will study whether surface-enhanced crystal growth results from surface-enhanced molecular mobility. Surface diffusion coefficients of organic glasses will be measured for the first time by the method of surface grating decay and correlated with surface crystal growth rates. The project will examine what properties of coating materials are important for suppressing surface crystallization. Computer simulations will identify the underlying mechanisms of bulk and surface crystal growth of organic glasses. For each growth mode, a screening experiment will be performed to assess its generality and polymer additives will be added to perturb it for further insights on its mechanism and control.<br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Crystallization influences almost every aspect of modern technology. While it has been extensively studied for hard inorganic materials, crystallization remains poorly understood for organic materials. In this collaborative project, a team of academic and industrial researchers will seek to understand the crystallization of organic glasses. Glasses are liquids that are too cold to flow; they are the preferred materials for many applications, ranging from pharmaceutical development to telecommunication. The team will study the activation of new, fast modes of crystal growth as a liquid becomes a glass and the control of these new modes in developing amorphous materials. The results of this research will benefit scientists in a range of fields where crystal growth is important; for example, amorphous pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. The enormous potential of using amorphous solids to enhance the bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs has motivated Abbott to partner with the University of Wisconsin in this project. It is a unique advantage that the Chicago-based Abbott is only a short distance away from Madison, enabling close interactions between the collaborators. Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from the multi-disciplinary nature of this project, having significant exposure to experiments and simulations, crystals and glasses, high and low molecular weight organic materials, and both industrial and academic research labs. Personnel supported by this grant will work with UW-Madison?s Pre-college Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence (PEOPLE), which has a proven record of increasing the enrollment of minority and low-income high school students in colleges and universities. This program provides experiences that help students to become scientifically literate citizens and encourages them to consider careers in science and engineering."

Therefore, in order to understand feedbacks between environment and organism performance, it must be determined whether and how organisms adapt their phenotypic responses to commonly encountered stressors such as predators. These responses to stressors may come at both current and future costs to the organisms performance. This project aims to determine whether and how local adaptation of the stress response occurs in populations of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) that live along a gradient of larval predation risk. Using a common-garden approach coupled with stress hormone manipulation, the project will test for adaptation in two potential mechanisms that would reduce the costs of stress in high-predator ponds: reduction of stress hormone production to predators, and reduction of physiological responsiveness to circulating stress hormones. If the cost of chronically responding to the constant presence of predators is greater than the benefit, then investigators expect that tadpoles from populations in high-predator ponds will exhibit either reduction of their production of stress hormones or reduction in their response to experimentally-elevated stress hormones. The results from this project will contribute to our general understanding of the effects of environmental stress on organisms as well as provide insights into how amphibians in particular are able (or unable) to cope with chronic environmental challenges. In addition, this project will provide opportunities for involving undergraduates in primary research, as well as incorporating public outreach and education to local landowners regarding the amphibians and other organisms their ponds and wetlands support."

In terms of the number and size of its telescopes, the length of its baselines, the broad range of wavelength regimes and spectral resolutions covered by its beam combiners, its imaging capabilities, and broad group of collaborators and users, the CHARA Array is among the most powerful facilities of its type and is unique in the world.<br/><br/>Previous publications from CHARA data include: measuring the oblateness and other physical parameters (including gravity darkening) for the rapidly rotating stars Regulus, Alderamin and Vega; detecting the inner-most regions of Vega's circumstellar disk; discovering that cool, low-mass stars of solar composition are larger in diameter for a given mass than lower metal abundance stars of the same mass, suggesting the presence of additional opacity sources not accounted for by current models; measuring the angular separation between the components of the binary star 12 Persei to an accuracy 0.05% of the separation, which significantly improves the accuracy of the masses for the component stars; K band measurements of the angular dimensions of circumstellar disks; a measurement of the diameter of the transiting exoplanet HD 189733b; imaging the surface of the rapidly rotating star Altair, the first time this has been done for a dwarf apart from the Sun.<br/><br/>Two newly commissioned beam combiners will leverage the Array's limiting resolution by extending the operating regime from the near IR to the visible region of the spectrum while providing high spectral resolution and improved sensitivity. Broader impact beyond the scientific and intellectual goals exists in three areas. First, CHARA is actively training the next generation of scientific and technical experts in the field of interferometry. A significant fraction of astronomy graduate students at Georgia State University are pursuing their PhD research with the Array. CHARA staff members have participated in many of the NASA/JPL Michelson Summer Schools, and CHARA has published on its website ninety-four Technical Reports available to the international community. Second, CHARA is enhancing science awareness in the large and diverse undergraduate community by incorporating results from the Array in undergraduate astronomy courses, which enroll approximately 700 students per semester. Third, CHARA actively participates in informal science education through such efforts as the collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History as well as through CHARA's own Exhibit Hall located in the CHARA Operations Center on Mount Wilson."

Human responses to impending changes, by choice or by necessity will be equally uneven and perhaps more difficult to predict than the physical and ecological changes driving them. As evidence from the past archive has built and models have improved in their ability to simulate the present and project into the future, so the evidence has accumulated increasingly clear signs that change is under way. Changes are spatially uneven, effecting climate zones and climate dynamics differently in different parts of the planet. Regions where changes are expected to be extreme lie close to places where little change is expected. These physical changes imprint themselves on a world where human welfare and development progress is also spatially uneven, sculptured by many forces of global change including the continued growth of population, especially in the poorer countries, the re-shaping of landscapes through human appropriation and the relentless depletion of natural resources. The outcomes for people and their ecological support systems throughout the world are extremely difficult to predict, but as expected the poorer parts of the world are where we see the most severe early.<br/><br/>Responses to climate change by national governments, international organizations like the UN, and NGOs have been inconsistent and incoherent. Proposed policy options and engineering remedies are diverse and occasionally bizarre. The public is ill informed and deeply divided. <br/><br/>The PIs will organize a one-day high-level community leadership workshop to start to shape such a response. They will assemble national research and education leaders as well as those involved at a high level in the economic and policy debates to deliberate on how to re-shape the country's consciousness on global climate change. The meeting will involve one full day and a preceding evening discussion. To ensure the effectiveness of the process the discussions will be moderated by a professional facilitator who will be responsible for delivering a succinct outcome document in a timely manner shortly following the meeting.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of such a workshop will be the setting of an agenda for research and education, agreed upon by the countries' leading actors in agencies and institutions that can effect change to meet the challenge.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Such an agenda will broadly impact the research community throughout the country to create a coherent and focuses effort in global change studies."

Ten scholarships are being awarded each year, for four years, with 32 different students supported by the UKanTeach Noyce Project. Excellent program enrichment activities that include mentor-teacher support, Saturday and summer workshops, and a careful selection process is increasing the likelihood of a successful Noyce program. The project's goal is a doubling of the number of talented secondary mathematics and science teachers prepared by the UKanTeach Program. The broader impact stems from the ability to recruit a formerly untapped pool of talent: students earning a degree in science and mathematics and a teaching license in four years. The intellectual merit of the program lies in the highly qualified and experienced project personnel and in a robust and supportive induction program for Noyce Scholars. This project is advancing knowledge and understanding by exploring the success of creative recruitment, preparation and retention strategies for mathematics and science teachers. The Scholars are being prepared, through coursework and by early field experience teaching in high needs schools, to take positions in districts that have high numbers of economically disadvantaged students."

The study is intended to aid the national governments, their relevant agencies/ministries, and private industries in assigning priorities for substantial and meaningful cooperation in developing and utilizing electricity from renewable energy. The study will pursue three separate but related goals: 1) Comparatively assessing resource potential in China and the U.S. for grid-scale electricity generation; 2) Exploring near-term market opportunities for mature technologies; and 3) Recommending priorities for enhanced collaboration, with a focus on cost reduction, improved efficiency and grid connectivity, and storage. Approach: National Academy of Sciences President Ralph J. Cicerone will appoint a committee that will include experts in renewable energy technologies; electricity generation, transmission, and distribution; energy policy; and energy economics. The committee will work with a similarly appointed Chinese committee, to outline the study, organize meetings, and prepare the consensus report. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed study will assess the technology risks and tradeoffs for various energy technologies. Much of this technological information will be applicable and adaptable to China, and so an understanding of the geographic, technical, and economic constraints will provide the context for Chinese decision makers to develop appropriate strategies to sustainably meet their energy needs. In some areas, notably biomass utilization, China is among the world leaders, and certain technologies may be applicable in the U.S. context as well. Similarly, China's manufacturing prowess, combined with its growing domestic market, provide opportunities to accelerate progress along the learning curve and reduce costs for renewable energy technologies. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Having a credible, authoritative, bilateral report highlighting the opportunities for substantial engagement, cooperation, and further investment should catalyze future U.S.-Chinese collaboration among government agencies, industries, and other relevant stakeholders. As part of the study process, the committees will hold several information-gathering meetings which are open to the public. In addition to engaging both countries at an institutional level, this study will engage relevant research universities, government laboratories and agencies, and industries in their public meetings. This will serve several purposes: 1) it will inform the committee about ongoing and planned activities being carried out in each country, 2) it will help the committee develop a report that speaks to the particular informational needs of these diverse stakeholders, and 3) it will facilitate connections between these stakeholders and some of the leading experts in various aspects of renewable energy. Following its completion, the report will be translated into Chinese and made publicly available electronically and in print form. A separately published Executive Summary, geared towards decision makers, will be widely disseminated in both countries. The committees will also consider holding a public event to formally release the reports and discuss its main findings and recommendations. <br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Energy for Sustainability (CBET); Power, Controls and Adaptive Networks (ECCS); and NanoManufacturing (CMMI) programs from the Engineering Directorate and the Synthesis (CHEM) program from the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate."

These 'heavy' chemical elements are produced inside stars, and released into interstellar gas as the stars die. In young galaxies, both their active nuclei and violent starbirth can eject heavy-element-rich gas into intergalactic space. Thus the amount of carbon and oxygen in the intergalactic gas traces the formation of the galaxies. The strongest spectral lines of highly-ionized carbon and oxygen are in the ultraviolet. But in the spectra of distant quasars, cosmic expansion means that we observe these lines at wavelengths longer by the redshift factor 1+z, so they are seen at visible or even infrared wavelengths. Dr. Simcoe will take high-quality optical spectra to derive carbon and oxygen abundances for gas that lies between us and luminous quasars in the redshift range 2.5<z<4.5. Studies of the 14 known quasars with z>5.8 that are accessible from the Southern-hemisphere Magellan telescopes will be a first science project for the FIRE infrared spectrograph, which Dr. Simcoe has built under an earlier NSF grant. FIRE should be ready to go to the telescope in late 2009. <br/><br/>A graduate student will be trained by working on this project. Dr. Simcoe will continue to train undergraduate students through MIT's UROP program; he has already mentored five students through this program, four of whom were members of groups under-represented in the physical sciences. During this early science project with FIRE, Dr. Simcoe and his team will optimize the reduction and analysis tools, and make them available to the Magellan user community."

The central focus is on A. Jean Ayres, a woman scientist, therapist and pioneer. She invented Sensory Integration (SI), a new form of therapy for children experiencing learning and social difficulties because they could not adequately integrate information from multiple sensory modalities. Ayres combined a desire to help children with a recognition that scientific rigor was essential in diagnosis and treatment. She established a scientific basis for her diagnoses and treatment, using statistical techniques to identify symptoms and neuroscience to determine a cause. Ayres encouraged her students to set up their own clinics, diagnosing and treating children; in the process, she and her students elevated the field of Occupational Therapy (OT), from paraprofessional to professional, giving OTs autonomy and decision-making authority. Such a transformation met with resistance, of course, even within OT. <br/><br/>This project involves analyzing Ayres' thinking processes, including the development of her theory, her diagnostic tests and how she designed devices to enhance therapy. The project also studies the way in which her network of students and allies grew, and where her efforts experienced resistance. The analyses of thinking are usually referred to as cognitive, and the analyses of the growth of a network of practitioners as social, but in fact the cognitive and the social are inextricably intertwined. For example, Ayres was particularly open to ideas from students; therefore, her network expanded not by conversion but by incorporating the best ideas from those who were drawn to SI. <br/><br/>The Ayres case-study will provide valuable lessons for those who contemplate socially-relevant scientific careers, and these lessons will be highlighted in dissemination. This project will contribute to the growing field of psychology of science by improving on existing methods for graphing discovery, invention, and innovation in ways that can be applied to new case-studies by other researchers."

In this context, accretion means that material is flowing through the disk and landing on the young star. The current astrophysical understanding is that most of the mass assembled in YSOs passes through such disks and that protostellar disks are the incubators of planets. Energetic, collimated outflows (jets) are also a ubiquitous feature of YSOs, and there is strong evidence that they are intimately linked to the accretion process. Planets are believed to form in protostellar disks through the gradual growth of dust grains into planetesimals. <br/><br/>The aim of this work is to investigate the possibility that the presence of a large-scale magnetic field in the disk is key for understanding several aspects of star formation, including the production and evolution of jets, the transfer of angular momentum (spin) outward in the disk, and the migration of early planets within the disk. Building on extensive previous modeling work by the PI on the formation of stars, this work will generate self-consistent calculations of the global dust distribution in a magnetized, wind-driving disk, create spectral and imaging diagnostics of the dust and gas distributions in the disk/wind system for testing against existing and future observations, and explore the possible reduction of inward planet migration by the effect of a<br/>large-scale magnetic field on the disk's response to the gravitational perturbation induced by the planet's circular motion.<br/><br/>The implications of the planned studies to the formation of the solar system and of extrasolar planets should elicit wide interest and will be broadly disseminated, including in public lectures by the PI. The PI and his students will also continue work with K-12 students and teachers in inner-city schools."

Predicting the way infectious diseases will affect populations is greatly helped by understanding the contributions of both genetic and environmental factors to disease distribution. The investigators will test the relative importance of these factors in nature by using the anther-smut disease of alpine plants as a natural model system. This pathogen is found only at high altitudes across Europe, despite the abundance of hosts at lower elevations. Field transplants combined with experimental introduction of the disease will be used to test differences in its spread at low and high elevations, and to understand the factors responsible for its restriction to high elevations. The researchers will be able to test theories of disease spread and distribution with virtually no risk to commerce, agriculture, or human health. The results will yield key insights into how host-pathogen interactions affect natural populations, and will help to inform predictions concerning the spread of existing and emerging infectious diseases. Furthermore, the study will influence interpretations of changes in elevational distribution of alpine species, which are very sensitive indicators of global climate change. <br/><br/>This project provides opportunities for undergraduate students to gain research experience and academic training. The research will allow expansion of several ongoing collaborations, particularly with scientists abroad. In addition, because these experiments are located within a highly-visited public botanic garden they will continue to contribute to raising public awareness about disease biology."

Integrated filtering which is necessary for fluorescence will be done using polarization rather than spectral filtering. The integrated device will be independent of wavelength and is expected to be used with multiple fluorescent dyes for simultaneous detection. This will miniaturize and integrate the analysis and sample manipulation capabilities.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this work are in the integration of organic photonics and biomedical microfluidics to realize an economical device with integrated microfluidics, organic excitation sources, and organic detectors, for compact, disposable, and quantitative fluorescence based assays.

The biggest barrier to widespread use of NRs in biological applications is their surface coating ligand. Synthesis of NRs requires the ligand cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), which is amphiphilic and forms a bilayer on the NR surface. Because CTAB binds weakly to the NR, it is fluxional, and therefore there must be excess free CTAB for the NRs to remain soluble in water. The CTAB coating not only complicates NR use in triggered release for drug delivery, but also prevents interfacing to biology. While surface chemistry of spherical nanoparticles (NPs) can be routinely modified, and NP conjugation to DNA and proteins and other biological molecules is straightforward, analogous success with Au NRs has not yet been achieved. Thus, there is a need for a way to customize the surface chemistry of NRs. A method that completely replaces CTAB with a variety of molecules is desirable. Single phase methods cannot remove CTAB completely, so the PI proposes to explore two-phase ligand extraction to modify Au NRs surfaces. She will test a range of molecules that can be put on the surface in order to expand the versatility of the surface chemistry of the NRs. The ligand exchanged NRs will be characterized by FTIR, optical absorption, TEM, electrophoretic mobility, and dynamic light scattering. Stability of the ligand-exchanged NRs will be assayed in water and buffers. After ligand exchange the NRs will be functionalized with thiolated DNA oligonucleotides of varying lengths (15-50mers). The DNA function will be probed by quantifying its ability to hybridize to a complement and also by measuring the biophysical properties of the NR-DNA conjugates such as zeta potential and hydrodynamic radius. The stability of the NR-DNA conjugates will be assayed, and the conditions and surface chemistry that maximize DNA loading and function will be determined.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: Potential applications of surface-modified NRs include use as drug delivery or photothermal devices triggered by highly penetrating infrared radiation in a wavelength range where water and tissue are generally transparent. Many imaging applications can also be envisaged for NRs targeted for specific tissues. The PI describes in detail a planned workshop designed to inform female (and male) students about successful strategies for negotiating a successful academic or scientific career while raising a family."

A primary target film composition will be the Cu/Mn alloy, because these films have been shown to form 2-8 nm MnSixOy diffusion barriers between the silica/silicon and copper layers. Such Cu diffusion barriers are critical for the microelectronics industry in their quest for fabricating smaller feature sizes on silicon chips. Presently, only sputtering methods are capable of forming requisite Cu/Mn alloy films, and they provide poor coverage when applied to substrates with very small feature sizes. A central feature of the collaborative project will be sending Wayne State University students to SAFC Hitech for 3 to 6 month internships to gain an industrial perspective on the electronic chemical field.

A unifying theme is that at its core lie plurisubharmonic functions and positive closed currents, either as main objects of investigation or as main tools to be employed. One direction of research deals with problems in pluripotential theory on compact complex manifolds, where there are new interesting phenomena, different from the local setting. The main goals are the study of the complex Monge-Ampere operator and of the corresponding Green functions. Another direction is concerned with problems from pluripotential theory in the complex Euclidean space. The questions to be considered involve geometric properties of positive closed currents and their approximation by analytic varieties, the study of pluricomplex Green functions and their connection to problems in algebraic geometry. A third direction of research is to analyze the behavior of polynomials along transcendental analytic varieties and to study the algebraic independence of entire functions. It is expected this will continue to have applications to transcendental number theory. The project also contains problems from complex dynamics, concerning polynomial automorphisms of complex Euclidean spaces, where pluripotential theory provides important tools.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Complex analysis and potential theory are central areas of Mathematics. Over the years, they have provided methods and powerful tools that helped solve many important problems from other fields of pure and applied Mathematics, as well as from Physics, Biology, etc. Thanks to the powerful methods of complex analysis, it has been often the case that progress is made in the study of concrete problems by formulating them first in the context of complex numbers. This project deals with the developing and further applications of new techniques from complex analysis and potential theory to problems in several important areas of modern Mathematics, such as number theory, complex and algebraic geometry, dynamical systems, as well as possible applications to Mathematical Physics. The problems to be studied belong to the main stream of current research in several complex variables. Making progress on these problems will contribute to the advancement of knowledge and understanding in the field. The proposed research will impact human resources development through summer funding of two graduate students. They will work for their dissertation under the investigator?s supervision on topics related to this project. In this way the project integrates research and education."

This project addresses synthesis/processing/fabrication research to explore quantum-cascade (QC) mid- and far-infrared light-emitting materials based on SiGe quantum wells (QWs). Since QC lasers are semiconductor light sources based on intersubband (ISB) transitions (i.e., electronic transitions between quantized states within the same energy band), their operation is essentially unaffected by the nature of the energy band gap of the underlying materials. Hence such considerations provide an approach for the demonstration of laser action in silicon ? a goal complicated by the indirect band gap of (Si)(Ge). Strain, however, associated with Si/SiGe QWs appears as a significant challenge to progress. This project takes a new approach, in which elasti-cally relaxed SiGe nanomembranes are used as the growth substrates and/or the active material. Such nanomembranes will be grown epitaxially on Si(Ge)-on-insulator substrates and then re-leased from the handle wafer by removing the underlying oxide layer via wet etching. The de-sired result would be a free-standing heterostructure where strain relaxation occurs via elastic strain sharing among the constituent epilayers without the formation of defects, and thus be vir-tually free of dislocations. The released nanomembranes could then be transferred onto other substrates. Further challenges complicating the demonstration of silicon-based QC lasers are provided by design issues specific to the SiGe QW materials system, which are also being ad-dressed on this project. An approach based on electronic ISB transitions in the L valleys of Ge/SiGe QWs will be explored. Recent calculations indicate that this approach may have advan-tages over the p-type structures that have been investigated so far, including longer nonradiative lifetimes, larger oscillator strengths, and more efficient tunneling transport.<br/>Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of elec-tronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. The proposed use of nanomembrane technology for the fabrication of complex semiconductor quantum structures has the potential for broad technological impact beyond the SiGe materials system and the QC-laser device application described above. Moreover, the project activities will promote education through the training of students across disciplines, ranging from semiconductor epitaxial growth to nanomembrane synthesis and processing, bandgap engineering, and THz (terahertz) photonics. To increase the effectiveness and scope of the program, the involvement of undergraduates and high-school interns will be emphasized, by leveraging existing programs with a strong focus on under-represented minorities."

The specific aims are to produce nanocomposites with controllable particle dispersion, determine the nanoscale morphology of coexisting crystalline phases, and determine the relationship between polymer dynamics and increased conductivity. Nanocomposites are relevant to SPEs because they have been demonstrated to increase conductivity into the practical range. However, the mechanism by which nanoparticles increase conductivity in SPEs is not well understood. One of the problems is aggregation of the particles, which is significant using standard preparation methods and leads to irreproducible samples and results. The project will apply a technique recently reported for controlling the length scale of phase separation in a polymer blend. This technique encapsulates the polymers in a nano-emulsion, followed by evaporation of the polymer phase solvent, leaving a polymer nano-sphere with controllable size suspended in a non-solvent by use of a surfactant. Two such preparations are mixed to form the blend. The current project will replace one of the polymers with a nanoparticle, but otherwise follow the same procedure. Production of nanocomposites with well controlled spacing will allow for study of crystallization, polymer mobility and conductivity under reproducible conditions, thus providing a mechanism for enhanced conductivity, as well as fundamental understanding of the behavior of confined polymer/salt complexes.<br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This project seeks to improve the properties of a material with potential use as a flexible and lightweight battery in portable and other devices. The required material is a solid plastic, and its use in batteries improves with the addition of nanometer-sized particles. The reason the particles improve properties is not well understood, because dispersion of the particles in the plastic matrix is difficult. The project will use a new method for dispersion of the particles, producing well characterized materials that can be used to gain the needed understanding. The materials will be studied using neutron scattering, a technique measuring both existence and movement of structures over nanometer length scales. The US has recently invested significantly in neutron scattering facilities: for example the Spallation Neutron Source at Oakridge National Laboratories. These expanded facilities require additional investigators to use the instruments. Thus outreach activities targeted towards scientific areas where neutron scattering is under-utilized is a part of this project."

While algebraic geometry has contributed applications in coding, industrial control, and computation, the topics of this project are more closely related to applications in theoretical physics, where physicists consider algebraic varieties as components of the fine structure of our universe. This is especially true with the first topic, moduli theory. This theory studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often manifested as an algebraic variety, called a moduli space, in its own right. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a community of ""organisms"" as itself being an ""organism"" is not a just a metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. Sometimes a collection of algebraic varieties manifests itself as a slightly more general object, called a stack, rather than a variety. Such stacks are a central object of study of this project. The other topic studied in this project is birational geometry, which is devoted to a certain abstract relationship, called birational equivalence, among algebraic varieties, which lies at the foundation of algebraic geometry."

Mosses are tiny plants that occur all over the world; even though there are thousands of species of moss, only one moss mitochondrial genome (i.e. all the DNA) has ever been sequenced. This project will sequence the entire mitochondrial genome from each of ten diverse species of moss, and will assess genome size, gene order, and DNA mutation rate. All these properties vary among mitochondrial genomes of larger plants, but are largely unknown in the mosses.<br/><br/>The project will also permit interpretation of another striking biological phenomenon. The mitochondrial DNA in plants is remarkably dynamic, and frequently picks up DNA from other parts of the cell in which it exists. Recently, the Palmer lab has shown that the mitochondria of a small tree known as Amborella have acquired the entire mitochondrial DNA from two separate species of moss. This was a surprise, because there is no known mechanism by which this massive transfer of DNA might take place. In trying to understand this phenomenon, it would help to know exactly which mosses shared their mitochondrial DNA with Amborella. This can be done by comparing the sequences of the moss DNA in Amborella with the sequences being generated in this project. It is possible that Amborella acquired the extra mitochondrial DNA from mosses living on its trunk."

A laser direct writing technique using high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser will be explored to produce compact 3D lightwave circuits. The approach takes advantages of multi-photon process induced by ultrashort laser pulses to initialize a universal photosensitivity response to change refractive indices in a wide array of optical materials. Bulk heating effects from high-repetition laser pulses will be utilized to mitigate laser-induced material damages to minimize optical loss and to achieve desired device performance of lightwave circuits. To fabricate 3D periodic photonic structures, multi-layer near-field diffractive optical elements will be developed to produce 3D interference patterns. Periodic photonic structures such as diamond-like photonic crystals will be fabricated using this one-optical-element and one-laser-exposure holographic fabrication process. <br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will yield a cross-platform laser manufacturing technique to fabricate high-quality lightwave circuits in a wide array of optical substrates. The fabrication technique will enable new 3D photonic circuit architectures that allows lightwave circuits to be routed vertically and continuously in- and out- of a plane. This will drastically increase the density, functionality, and complexity of the optical circuitry. The success of this research will also enable the fabrication of mid-IR fiber lasers and sensor devices for applications in chemical sensing and structural health monitoring in harsh environments. The holographic laser fabrication developed from this award can be conveniently built into the existing multiple mask fabrication flow for integrated optoelectronic circuit manufacturing. This enables the monolithic integration of photonic crystal structures with other on-chip optical components for widespread applications. This award will also support an interdisciplinary training program for undergraduate students on the integrated laser manufacturing and product innovation. Through undergraduate extracurricular activities on robotics and minority outreach activities, the proposed education programs will attract female and under-represented minority students to study engineering and science at both undergraduate and graduate levels."

The imaged pattern is consistent with fingering caused by precipitation-induced redissolution of a halite crust and a pre-existing convection pattern; the distribution of these fingers is similar to those observed in lab experiments and numerical simulations. <br/><br/>Natural free convection, which is important for heat and solute transport across a range of hydrogeologic settings, has been studied for over a century but almost entirely in theory, numerical models, and laboratory experiments. Currently, very little is known about the growth and decay of convective instabilities because most research assumes steady state conditions. In order to resolve key questions about origins and persistence of convection, as well as their associated spatial and temporal scales, it is vital to resolve the transient nature of different interacting regimes.<br/><br/>Our UAE field site is an ideal location to address some of these knowledge gaps. Precipitation records suggest that fingering at this site may only be initiated once every decade with a halite crust building up during dryer years. Our pilot data demonstrate the unique opportunity to monitor the dynamic nature of density fingering. We propose to integrate time-lapse geophysical, hydrological, and geochemical measurements with preliminary hydrological modeling. The exploratory research will provide a transformative advance for this important field. The results will be disseminated through research papers and conference presentations and will form the foundation for a continued research program including a full-scale modeling effort."

Grain refining is usually one of the first processing steps for the production of metal and alloy products. The conventional methods use chemical grain refiners that contain foreign particles. These methods have limited capability in reducing grain size, and foreign particles added into molten metals lead to defect formation during materials processing. This project will combine the latest technologies of processing of lightweight materials using ultrasonic vibration (USV) and continuous casting or direct chill casting technology, and to demonstrate the feasibility of an enabling technology for producing metal ingots of ultrafine grains without the use of foreign particles for grain refining. The new technology will provide cost effective opportunities for producing metal and alloy products with grain size much smaller than that obtainable using the best commercial grain refiners, addressing issues related to the defect formation associated with the use of grain refiners containing foreign particles and increasing the production rates of metals and alloys. <br/><br/>The successful completion of this Phase I project will lead to a breakthrough technology for grain refining of a vast array of metals and alloys to the grain size level that are not capable to achieve using the conventional technologies. Grain refining is important for maximizing ingot casting rate, improving resistance to hot cracking, minimizing elemental segregation, enhancing mechanical properties, particularly ductility, improving the finishing characteristics of wrought products, increasing the mold filling characteristics, and decreasing the porosity of foundry alloys. The commercial implementation of the project results has the potential of achieving significant cost savings, energy savings, and environmental benefits for the metal manufacturing industry. In addition, students involved in the research will have opportunities to interact with industrial partners.<br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."

One of the more unusual kinds of variation is conjugation, where two or more sperm join at the head to form a single functional unit. Conjugation is commonly interpreted as an adaptation to sperm competition and has independently arisen in groups as diverse as opossums, snails, and diving beetles. This study examines the evolutionary pathways and fitness consequences of sperm conjugation. The researchers will use behavioral observations, biochemistry, and cytology to (i) compare the intensity of sperm competition in species with and without sperm conjugation, (ii) test the hypothesis that conjugation provides protection from spermicidal environments, and (iii) quantify the effects of sperm length and conjugate size on motility, an important correlate of fertilization success.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research program includes its potential to reveal the relationship between sperm form and function and to improve understanding of the selective environment of sperm, a greatly neglected aspect of sexual selection.

Another objective of this project is to show that there is a close connection between the global regularity of the three-dimensional Euler equations and that of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, a new regularity analysis using a Lagrangian approach for the three-dimensional Euler equations is developed to control the dynamic growth of the local curvature of vortex filaments and the maximum vorticity simultaneously. The local nonlinear stability analysis developed in this project can be potentially applied to study a large class of nonlinear dynamic problems arising from other disciplines.<br/><br/><br/>The understanding of the dynamic stability and the role of convection has a significant impact on many scientific applications which could affect the quality of people's life in a fundamental way. These applications include weather forecasting, environmental or global climate change, fluid dynamic applications, turbulence modeling and high performance computing. For a long time, many experts considered convection as destabilizing. This project reveals that convection actually has a surprising stabilizing effect which could affect the large time behavior of the three-dimensional incompressible flows in an essential way. An additional impact of this project is the involvement of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. This project provides a solid training in mathematical analysis, physical modeling, and numerical simulation. The interdisciplinary training they receive in this project is very important for their future careers in mathematics and science."

Variational inequalities provide an effective means to <br/>derive properties of solutions of evolution equations and likewise, evolution equations can be used to derive variational inequalities. Exploiting this interplay has been very fruitful in the past, and the investigators plan to approach various problems using this perspective. One is to find correction terms of various examples of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality by exploiting a surprising connection to the porous medium equation and to the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. In particular, a correction term for the logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality will lead to an improved understanding of the solutions of the Keller-Segel model describing the chemotaxis of certain bacteria. A similar philosophy applies as well to certain problems in kinetic theory, with the plan to derive quantitative estimates on speed of approach to equilibrium for some inhomogeneous master equations of Kac type. These investigations tie in with analogous questions in quantum mechanics. Here the PI's plan to prove hypercontractivity estimates for Lindblad operators that describe dissipative quantum mechanical systems, with the aim to obtain quantitative estimates on the speed of approach to equilibrium as well. Another circle of problems is proving Lifshitz tails in the random displacement model. The aim there is to understand the conductivity properties of materials. <br/><br/>Many phenomena in science and technology can be modeled by evolution equations. An interesting example, treated in this proposal, is the Keller Segal model, that models the aggregation, or the absence thereof, in the motion of bacteria. Understanding the behavior of solutions of these equations is both biologically and mathematically interesting. Likewise, it is widely observed thatn systems of many interacting particles, either classical or quantum mechanical, evolve toward an equilibrium, and they do this at a certain speed, often largely independent of the number of particles. Understanding this, and determining this speed is one of the objects of this research. Another question of great interest is what distinguishes a conductor from an insulator. There are simple models in quantum mechanics that are supposed to exhibit these kind of behavior. While it is impossible to understand these phenomena by exact computations, using mathematical techniques notably from analysis, the PI's aim to understand these processes better. Conversely, applied problems, e.g., the porous medium equations that describes the seepage of water in dams, can be used to find interesting mathematical facts, which in turn lead to improved understanding of other problems. It is this interplay of pure and applied mathematics that is the focus of the PI's research and it has been an excellent way to educate graduate students as well as undergraduates, and to draw them into mathematical research."

The PI has conjectured an explicit relationship between the values of a cup product on cyclotomic p-units and p-adic L-values, taken modulo p, of newforms that satisfy congruences with Eisenstein series at a prime above p. The proposed research relates to this through a number of distinct but intertwined sub-projects, including an algebraic study of the structure of the Selmer groups of the associated modular representations, the exploration of relationships with Kato's Euler system and classical main conjectures, and the precise formulation of certain generalizations.<br/><br/>A remarkable aspect of algebraic number theory lies in the connections it finds between objects that appear to be of entirely different natures. These objects can roughly be described as falling into two classes: those that are algebraic, and those that are analytic. The algebraic objects are typically found by considering numbers that can be formed by applying the standard operations of arithmetic to the roots of polynomial equations, or by considering the symmetries of those roots. The analytic objects are often functions on interesting spaces with values that are complex numbers. The project concerns an unexpected direct comparison between the algebraic values of a function on pairs of numbers and the analytic power series attached to highly symmetrical complex-valued functions known as modular forms. The PI is exploring this and its many consequences in arithmetic."

Doctoral student Adam Levy, under the supervision of Dr. John O'Loughlin, will explore these border zones and how they have become key sites of government intervention aimed at re-establishing national sovereignty. <br/><br/>This project will analyze the key tensions underlying uncertainties about Moldovan citizenship and identity. These tensions indicate that while governments are attempting to re-territorialize these border regions, informally individuals are experiencing de-territorialization of these regions because of fragmented visa and labor restrictions. The key research question is: What does Moldovan citizenship mean to people in the border zones and how does their view compare to governmental perspectives? <br/><br/>This project uses mixed methods including interviews, surveys, focus groups, and participant observation to understand how people who may or may not identify as Moldovan respond to new governmental regulations, like EU migration policies or Romanian passport controls. This approach will enable a comparison of formal ideas and attitudes about state- and region-building with those of the people who live in these regions. Data collected for the project will chart perceptions of nations/states, allegiances to ethno-linguistic communities, household migration histories, and ideas about iconic landscapes as measures of identity and attachment to places. The research will also show how ethno-national identity and regional geopolitical events are understood across generations. The findings will thus address basic questions about how European relations and post-Soviet identities are forged.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this study highlight Moldova's Romanian and Ukrainian frontiers to show where and how states like Moldova are situated within economic and security communities like the European Union (EU) or NATO. Practical political applications of this project include better understandings about how borders are imagined and administered across Europe and the former Soviet Union. Unlike analyses of Moldovan nationalism and EU/NATO ""double enlargement"", this project will focus on people living in and traversing border zones - not just the governing officials of these regions. Working with borderland stakeholders defined as different generations of government officials, students, teachers, farmers, traders, activists, pensioners, politicians and return-migrants, this research will highlight the real and conceptual distance between formal and informal understandings of national identity to study how such views relate to conceptions of citizenship. Focusing on informal understandings in contrast to formal ones, this approach will detail exactly how the transformation of authority and identity is experienced and contested in borderlands. As such, this study contributes answers to key geopolitical questions about how nations, states, and territory are consolidated. Additional contributions will improve knowledge about how borders are made, managed, and perceived in traditional ""crush zones"" like the Black Sea region. Academics, policy-makers, and administrators interested in EU/NATO divisions and migration management will profit from these findings. This project will generate fresh answers to big social and political questions about exactly where and how efforts to mark the limits of European countires are unfolding."

Diversity gradients suggest that this region is a Center of Origin, yet this theory lacks a convincing mechanism to explain the creation of this biodiversity. Although terrestrial biologists rely heavily on allopatric models to explain speciation and the creation of biodiversity, the appropriateness of allopatric divergence is questionable in marine ecosystems where pelagic larval dispersal is assumed to facilitate gene flow and limit genetic differentiation among geographically isolated populations. Previous work Dr. Barber and others has challenged this assumption by identifying sharp regional genetic breaks in stomatopod populations throughout the IWP, suggesting that the Malucca and Flores Seas may act as barriers to pelagic larval dispersal. <br/><br/>This project integrates physical oceanography, population genetics, and geography in a comparative phylgeographic framework to explicitly test the role of allopatric divergence in marine species with pelagic larval dispersal. By examining geographic, temporal, and genealogical concordance in multiple reef-dwelling species, allopatric divergence across the Malucca and Flores Seas (by vicariance or isolation of peripheral populations) will be explicitly tested, significantly advancing our understanding of the origins of high marine biodiversity in the IWP and of evolutionary processes in marine environments.<br/><br/>This work will form the foundation of undergraduate/graduate education efforts in <br/>The form of courses that integrate marine biology and modern molecular genetics through the study of larval dispersal/recruitment and evolutionary processes in marine environments. Course work will be extended and enhanced by undergraduate research experiences that provide training in field and laboratory techniques through independent mentored research. The research will form a conduit for a scientific exchange, training, and mentoring graduate students and Indonesian scientists to prepare the next generation of marine scientists for active careers studying the marine environments of the IWP.<br/><br/>Undergraduate educational efforts will blur traditional boundaries separating marine and molecular biology and will increase interest in marine research by providing cohesive and integrated research experiences. Aggressive recruitment efforts targeting underrepresented minorities for these opportunities will increase diversity within the marine science community. The combination of these undergraduate research activities with new and existing courses in a research emphasis track will serve as a model for expanding the curriculum in the Boston University Marine Program and will increase undergraduate educational and research opportunities within the Woods Hole community. Graduate education and international scientific exchanges will expand the community of marine scientists that are proficient in the theory and application of molecular techniques to marine science, and will fertilize an increase in marine research focused in the IWP. The results produced through these combined efforts are essential to the management of marine resources. Identification of regionally isolated faunas and the processes that create them will aid in identifying regional management units, helping marine conservation strategies in the highly threaten reefs of the IWP to be framed in a biologically meaningful fashion. Combining these activities will provide the foundation for a career integrating research and education in the pursuit of understanding dispersal and evolutionary processes in marine environments."

The attractive properties of titanium alloys include high strength to weight ratio, excellent corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. For these reasons, they are used in a number of high technology areas. In many of these applications, components are subjected to constant loads over extended periods of time at low temperatures (<0.25Tm). Recently, many unexpected results have been reported which are of great importance in designing and in selecting titanium alloys for various applications. For example, it has been shown that twinning, which has traditionally been known to be a very fast deformation mechanism, can occur very slowly. Further, due to twinning, the single-phase &#945; and &#946; titanium alloys can creep (i.e. plastically deform) at low temperatures. It was also found that the deformation mechanisms of the two-phase &#945;-&#946; titanium alloys can be quite different than those of the single phase alloys due to interactions between phases. The exact reasons for this behavior are not known. The aim of this investigation is to systematically study the low temperature creep of &#945;-&#946; titanium alloys as a function of volume fraction and morphology of &#945; and &#946; phases; using three different Ti-V alloys as the model systems. Crystallographic modeling as well as three-dimensional anisotropic finite element modeling will be used to determine the interactions between phases. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy will be used to determine the deformation mechanisms. Based on these results, optimal microstructures for improved low temperature creep resistance will be identified.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>In a number of applications, loads are applied on structural members at low temperatures such as room temperature. At times, loads are applied on these structures over extended periods of time, which can result in time-dependent deformation, i.e. creep. This investigation focuses on determining optimal chemistry and microstructures of two-phase structural materials such as titanium alloys for low temperature creep resistance. The results will be widely publicized through participation in various technical conferences and publication in reputed journals. While this study of low temperature creep deformation is based on two-phase titanium alloys, the results are expected to contribute to the wide field of composite materials in general. During this investigation, graduate students will be trained in advanced modeling and experimental techniques. These graduate students will then go on to take up technical positions in industry, government, or education. In addition to participation in various national and international conferences, this project also promotes outreach to the community and diversity through such activities as the Materials Advantage Student Chapter. The Principal Investigator is the founding faculty advisor for the University of Maryland, College Park Materials Advantage Student Chapter. This chapter actively participates in open-houses at the University to educate the public on materials science. Further, this chapter encourages both undergraduate and graduate students to participate in the various national professional society meetings."

The major research goal is to understand how reversible binding affects the material?s rate-of-strain and mass transport kinetics. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) will be developed that 1) are transparent to light at all processing temperatures, 2) exhibit amorphous or rubbery low-temperature states, and 3) enable precise tuning of shape recovery temperatures and rates. Preliminary studies have shown that lightly crosslinked elastomers containing reversibly associating side-groups exhibit shape-memory effects with a unique temperature-dependent shape-recovery. Planned research builds on these findings through the synthesis of well-defined elastomers involving uncrosslinked (linear) polymer precursors. Living free radical polymerization of poly(acrylates) will be performed to systematically vary architectural parameters including a) covalent crosslink density, b) associating side-group content, c) side-group spacer length, and d) the type and strength of H-bonding side-group. Synthesized polymers and networks will be studied in solution and in the melt to elucidate mechanistic details that influence shape memory responses. Research will pave the way to develop new features including two-stage shape responses, light and magnetic field triggered responses, and recyclable shape-memory materials. Research will also examine how reversible hydrogen-bonding affect mass transport. Diffusion of small molecules through synthesized networks will be studied using a custom-built permeation apparatus as well as multiphoton fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (MP-FRAP) techniques. The research plan provides a springboard for the PI to investigate biomedical devices including intraocular lenses, spinal disk prosthetics, and drug delivery platforms.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>The principle investigator?s laboratory has recently developed novel shape-memory elastomers that use strong, reversible hydrogen-bonding groups to modify mechanical properties. The described study is to systematically vary the material architecture to fundamentally understand how reversible association affects time-scales of mechanical deformation and mass transport. The resulting knowledge will establish clear material design principles to foster new technologies including shape memory polymers, thermoplastic elastomers, and self-healing materials. Material responsiveness may also be exploited to engineer drug delivery devices and soft-tissue prosthetics designed for minimally invasive surgery. Educational aims are closely tied to research objectives. Graduate and undergraduate students will acquire research skills including polymer synthesis, rheology, transport studies, and thermal mechanical analysis. The research described is synergistic with a new course, ?Engineering of Soft Matter?, which introduces students to this emerging field. In addition, the PI will further develop the education outreach program ""Green Engineering"" to provide professional development opportunities to high school teachers. This program strengthens connections between secondary education teachers and the technical workforce by offering hands-on teaching workshops. There, high school teachers learn and discuss emerging ?green? technologies including energy conservation, photovoltaics, and fuel cells."

The first concerns development of a computational apparatus to derive asymptotics from mutlivariate generating functions. This is done using complex analytic methods. In one variable, the subject of analytic combinatorics is well developed, but in more than one variable, methods are only now beginning to be understood. Geometric properties of the singular variety of the generating function become important, requiring further work both in the construction of appropriate deformations and in the effective computation of the resulting integrals.<br/>The second area of proposed research concerns analysis of several probability models. One of these is to find perfect squares in products of random integers. This model, due to Pomerance, arises in sieving methods of factorization. In past work, we analyzed a square-finding algorithm believed to have asymptotically the shortest possible run time. In fact we know it to be within about 30% of the best run time, but would like to prove that it is in fact asymptotically optimal. A positive result would tell us the algorithm in fact searches for an asymptotically optimal witness. Other probability models in the proposal include searches and sampling in trees of exponential growth, and computations saddle point integrals for likelihood functions. <br/>Here follows a ""big-picture"" description of how this research is situated with respect to problems of general scientific interest.<br/><br/>Generating functions are perhaps the single most widely applicable technique for counting or estimating the size of combinatorial classes.<br/>Generating functions encode recursive information: tractable generating <br/>functions exist when the sizes of the classes satisfy a recursion. <br/>An explicit (non-recursive) descriptions of these numbers is usually more desirable. For example, the recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers, a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2), while remakably simple, is less useful for size estimation than the explicit formula a(n) = (1+o(1)) b^n where b is the Golden ratio. It has been known for several decades how to convert one-variable generating functions into explicit asymptotic formulae. Recent research of the PI and others extends this knowledge to generating functions for multivariate arrays. An important component of the proposed research is the automation of these new mutlivariate techniques, which requires development of effective tools for computing algebraic and topological invariants of polynomials. <br/><br/>One aspect of the utility of the proposed research on square subproducts is obvious: it gives us the run time of the main component of a basic and widely used factoring algorithm. The method of analysis is to show that the factorizations of random integers converge, in an appropriate sense, to a certain Poisson process. Probability limit theorems are common in analytic number theory, but the limit structure required for this analysis requires keeping track of the magnitude of<br/>the product of all the factors. A second aspect of the significance<br/>of the proposed research, therefore, is that it will develop a number-theoretic probability model containing more information than previous models, and to which actual factorizations of random integers may be shown rigorously to converge. The part of the proposal concerning searches and sampling on graphs of exponential growth is motivated by in part by the connection between uniform sampling and size estimation."

The properties are at the heart of Shelah's fundamental work on classification of first-order theories, as well as the results on excellent classes. Preliminary results allow to conjecture that failure of generalized amalgamation is witnessed by certain category-theoretic objects. Study of such objects is the central topic of this research. <br/><br/>Kolesnikov's approach allows to treat generalized amalgamation properties in first-order theories and non-elementary classes as particular cases of a common phenomenon. The starting point of this research is the development of a theory of generalized amalgamation for algebraically closed sets in stable first-order theories, extending the work of Hrushovski. Such a theory appears to be rich even for totally categorical theories and could be of independent interest.<br/><br/>A novel feature of this research is the idea to phrase generalized amalgamation in terms of functorial embeddings of simplicial complexes into models (of a first-order theory or those of an atomic class). <br/>The projected characterization of generalized amalgamation in terms of homological algebra would lead to influx of new ideas into model theory of both first-order theories and non-elementary classes.<br/><br/>Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic that aims to analyze classes of mathematical structures that are axiomatized in some way (the terms ""first-order theory"" and ""non-elementary class"" refer to certain kinds of axioms that are used). One of the subfields of model theory, called classification theory, attempts to identify conditions on a class of structures that provide substantial information about the overall behavior of the elements of the class. The finer analysis of geometric model theory attempts to connect the combinatorial geometry of structures, defined in model-theoretic terms, with geometries coming from classically known structures. Generalized amalgamation properties originated in classification theory. The expectation is that Kolesnikov's research will connect the failure of properties to the existence of certain objects studied in a different area of mathematics. This research will contribute to the broader efforts on solving a long-standing (classification-theoretic) conjecture of Shelah and, potentially, will help in developing geometric methods in model theory of non-elementary classes."

MCP sorbent performance derives from their high fractional volume (porosity) of tiny, nanometer-sized pores resulting in exceedingly high specific surface areas. An understanding of how these materials can adsorb such enormous amounts of gases and the chemical/physical basis for selective uptake are the major thrusts of the proposed research. In particular, the fundamental role of pore size, pore architecture, and pore interconnectedness will be observed for the first time during the actual processes of gas adsorption and solvent removal. Enabling this unique viewpoint is the first use in MCPs of positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, an antimatter probe of porous materials recently developed to characterize microporous thin film dielectric insulators in microelectronic devices. Adoption of this technique has the potential to transform how researchers probe porosity in sorbents. Only by understanding how changes on the microscale and nanoscale exert an effect on apparent porosity can the best modes of exploiting existing MCPs be realized. Ultimately these results will be of practical use to guide the synthesis of new materials. MCP?s are expected to find broad application in energy research (gas storage) and environmental research (gas purification) and since MCPs are now being commercialized they are at the point where direct impact on society can and will be felt.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This research brings together chemists and physicists in an effort to transform the study of ultrahigh performance sorbents?the nanomaterials that are themselves transforming the field of chemical separations.

These highly porous sorbents are expected to find broad application in alternative energy (gas storage) and industrial processes (gas purification) and since they are now beginning to be commercialized they are at the point where direct impact on society will be felt. The impact of this research is totally dependent on the successful interaction of chemists and physicists. Graduate and undergraduate students will cross discipline boundaries to learn in a broadly diverse and collaborative environment involving frequent interaction with industry. For these reasons the potential for obtaining transformative research results is high. However, this will only be possible if the properties of the materials are sufficiently well understood to allow widespread deployment in new more efficient processes. It is clear that sorbent technology has not yet achieved this point, but the proposed research will do much to enable reaching this goal."

The most common type of shape memory material is one for which the shape change is achieved by changes in temperature, i.e., a thermally-induced shape memory effect. Such materials possess at least two independent crosslinked networks, at least one of which is thermally reversible. The materials have a permanent shape due usually to a covalently crosslinked network, but they can be reshaped above a thermal transition (Tc) of a second, reversible network and fixed into a temporary shape when cooled under stress to below Tc. When reheated above the critical temperature, the material remembers and reverts to the permanent shape due to entropy elasticity. The objective of the proposed work is to develop and understand the structure and properties of a new class of SMP based on blends of an elastomeric ionomer and low molar mass fatty acids or their salts. A major goal is to understand the molecular origin of shape memory in such materials. Nanophase separation of the ionomer or covalent crosslinking of the ionomer will be used to develop the permanent network. Very strong ionic or dipolar interactions between the polymer and the fatty acid (salt) will allow crystals of the fatty acid (salt) to function as thermally reversible, physical crosslinks that can provide a temporary shape. Since, the melting point of the fatty acid (salt) serves as Tc, the temperature of the shape memory effect can be easily controlled by choosing an appropriate fatty acid (salt) for the compound. This will provide significant versatility in the tailoring of Tc, as well as the mechanical properties of the SMP. <br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Shape memory polymers (SMP) have applications as medical devices (orthodontic wires, polymer stents with drug delivery capabilities, biodegradable implants, smart surgical sutures), actuators, sensors, artificial muscles, switches, smart textiles and self-deployable structures.

Advanced optical, structural, surface, and electronic characterization techniques will be applied to these systems to develop an understanding of the properties of the specific functionalized surfaces under study, and define a systematic approach to uncovering the interfacial morphological and electronic properties of organic/inorganic hybrid materials. <br/>Non-Technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new understanding and capabilities for potential next generation electronic/photonic devices. Organic/inorganic composites have the potential for creating electronic materials with new functionality in energy efficiency, biological, medical, and environmental applications. This project will accelerate the development of these materials by providing fundamental understanding of one of the key issues limiting performance. The proposed project directly integrates research with education. Students and faculty will work with an existing outreach program at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) aimed at Denver elementary and middle schools with large populations of underrepresented groups. Modules, which connect basic science concepts to the impact that advanced materials are having on the world, will be introduced into these schools. Approaches developed during the project will also be included in a teacher recertification program taught by one of the Co-PIs. The project includes significant undergraduate research involvement through summer REU opportunities and an international student exchange with NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology). All of the students will work on a daily basis as part of an integrated team with their advisors, collaborators at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) which is located in close proximity to CSM, with scientists at NTNU, and with colleagues at the University of Arizona. A focus on diversity, communication skills, and developing skills for work in a team environment are all integral parts of the proposed program. This project is co-funded by the DMR Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, and the DMR Electronic and Photonic Materials program."

Finding necessary and sufficient conditions for two ideals to belong to the same linkage class is the central, though wide open, problem in the theory. The investigator suggests an answer to this question for zero-dimensional monomial ideals. The local-algebraic and the projective-geometric branch of linkage theory have proceeded in parallel, with only few implications known between them. The proposer plans to investigate this subtle interplay by studying the differences between local linkage and homogeneous linkage. Since the equivalence relation generated by classical linkage might be too restrictive for some purposes, the more inclusive notion of Gorenstein linkage has become a welcome alternative. The investigator has the broader goal of showing that in a given regular local ring all Cohen-Macaulay ideals of a fixed codimension belong to the same Gorenstein linkage class. The proposer plans to exploit recent advances on the topic of j-multiplicities to address some long standing problems in equisingularity theory. Equisingularity theory strives to find numerical conditions for when the members of a family of analytic sets are `equivalent' to one another. The investigator seeks to provide such a criterion by proving a general `principle of specialization of integral dependence' based on j-multiplicities. The investigator also proposes an intersection theoretic expression for the j-multiplicity of a module that would yield a recursive formula for computing this multiplicity. The core of an ideal is a subideal that encodes information about all possible reductions of the ideal, while being closely related to Briancon-Skoda type theorems and a conjecture of Kawamata about sections of line bundles. The investigator wishes to explore the connection between cores and multiplier ideals, a notion from complex algebraic geometry. He expects that a better understanding of this interplay will shed new light on both concepts and may lead to a combinatorial description of the core in the monomial case. Having worked out an algorithm for computing the core of zero-dimensional monomial ideals, the investigator now wishes to find such an algorithm for monomial ideals of arbitrary dimension. The known results about cores of ideals require restrictions on the local numbers of generators of the ideal as well as residual or depth conditions, assumptions that are satisfied by any zero-dimensional ideal. The investigator proposes to advance the theory beyond the class of ideals satisfying these conditions, using the monomial case as a testing ground.<br/><br/>The proposer works in Commutative Algebra, an area concerned with the qualitative study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables. Such systems arise in algebraic geometry, but also in numerous applications outside of mathematics. Over the past two decades commutative algebraists have become increasingly interested in computational aspects, thereby establishing connections to applied areas such as computer algebra, robotics, cryptography, coding theory, statistics, and biology. This investigator's research too has a strong computational component, and his work on equisingularity theory in particular encompasses concrete geometric applications."

Excess phosphorus often causes eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems. Eutrophication remains a pervasive problem in the U.S. and can impact aquatic ecosystems as blooms of toxic phytoplankton, reduced water clarity, changes in plant communities, and fish kills. Due to the ability of the sediments to accumulate phosphorus, wetlands are often managed to store phosphorus and prevent entry into downstream ecosystems. The ability of wetland sediments to bind phosphorus varies, and at times wetlands can become sources of, rather than sinks for, phosphorus. The ways in which phosphorus binds to and is released from sediments has been studied extensively in deep lakes, but less so in shallow wetlands. Shallow wetlands differ from lakes in that they often dry and re-flood and tend to have sediments with more organic matter (decomposing plant material). This study investigates how water level fluctuations influence phosphorus binding and release in wetland sediments of varying characteristics.<br/><br/>The findings of this research will not only inform understanding of how sediment controls plant growth in freshwater ecosystems through P release, but will have direct applications to management of many freshwater ecosystems. The findings of this research will provide insight into how best to manage wetlands to promote phosphorus accumulation in sediments and prevent its release to downstream ecosystems. In addition to management implications of the research itself, researchers will educate the general public through development of K-12 curricula aimed at teaching the definition, ecology, and functional roles of wetlands and wetland sediment. Lesson plans will be developed through a partnership with teachers at Lawton Community Schools in Southwest Michigan, and will be taught to students there with direct assessment of student learning. Assessments of student learning from lesson plans will aide in refining lesson plans for publication in education literature. Finally, undergraduate students interested in ecology will be given opportunities to conduct independent research experiences as part of this project."

The presence of major scientific research institutions in a region does not, by itself, lead to social and economic benefit in that region.  The importance of hard assets such as R&D expenditures, patents and venture capital, as well as the critical mass and propinquity of scientific talent is well known. However, this research probes in detail a set of social mechanisms which are postulated to enable some regions to transfer and commercialize knowledge more effectively than others.  It examines the importance of the robust activity of S&T boundary-spanning organizations in a region in contributing to successful technology commercialization as measured by number of new business startups.  These S&T boundary-spanning organizations, social gatherings of cross-disciplinary and cross-functional groups including both technologists and their business supporters, are of three types:  formal groups that support local technologies (trade associations and entrepreneur-aiding groups); volunteer-run chapters affiliated with national organizations (e.g. IEEE, AeA, Sigma Xi, AWIS); and informal volunteer-run affinity groups focused often on a particular interdisciplinary subject such as systems biology or nanotechnology.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/>Previous research on social dynamics, largely descriptive and anecdotal, has yet to inform policy.  This project studies and quantifies the following aspects of the region's boundary-spanning groups:  their types, numbers, meeting frequency and attendance, their membership diversity (Shannon-Wiener index), and the region's overall membership overlap among these boundary-spanning groups.  These independent variables are then correlated with new business startups  including controls for R&D expenditures, patent activity, venture capital, critical mass and propinquity of the region?s scientific workforce.  <br/><br/>An initial set of three pilot case studies represent the first step in the development of a predictive model based on machine learning techniques.  A recommended data structure is being developed so that other research institutions or their regions may also gather data to perform self assessments and thus add to the training and test data used to test and enhance the resulting model.<br/><br/>Broader impacts:   This work develops  metrics which capture ""cultural and social dynamics"" and correlates them with successful knowledge flows between research institutions and a dynamic regional commercialization ecology.  It searches for the social factors that distinguish vibrant regions with the capacity to innovate from those that do less, in order to better understand the processes by which investments in S&T research are transformed into positive social and economic outcomes.<br/> <br/>This information may influence how regions and research organizations set policy to stimulate social networks and inclusive interdisciplinary discourse groups. The increased understanding of previously-uncharacterized aspects of knowledge flows should lead directly to new mechanisms available for optimization by policy makers. The application of artificial intelligence machine learning techniques in this work should also lead to new capabilities in the science of science policy."

Specifically, a self-powering system that harvests its operating energy directly from the environment is an attractive proposition for sensing, personal electronics and security technologies.<br/>This proposed in-situ stretching and poling process by the near-field-electrospinning for the production of orderly deposited piezoelectric nanofibers is the key innovation of the project.

Few observations are available to test the theories proposed by the models. This dearth of observations happens because extreme freshwater fluxes are typically associated with storms whose paths and regions of impact are uncertain until only a few hours in advance. However, extreme freshwater pulses may also develop from large precipitation pulses occurring far upstream in a river that ultimately feeds onto an estuary. This is the case developing at the Georgia-Florida border. Intense rains in Georgia have caused flood levels in the rivers that flow through Florida into the Gulf of Mexico. Such a pulse represents a unique opportunity to collect observations on the impact that it may have on an estuary and the adjacent continental shelf. In particular, this pulse will impact a relatively shallow estuary and continental shelf (mostly <5 m). New findings will likely be generated on the influence of a freshwater pulse onto a shallow shelf. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The rivers of North Florida (Santa Fe and Suwannee), according to U.S. Geological Survey forecasts, are expected to attain record flood levels in their path toward the Gulf of Mexico. The Suwannee River is expected to crest at its lower reaches, at some time between April 21 and 23, 2009. This means that there will be record freshwater pulses that will affect the estuarine area of the lower Suwannee River and dramatic buoyancy inputs to the shallow, coastal region of the northeastern continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. This represents a unique opportunity to address three scientific questions that can only be addressed with the influence of extreme freshwater pulses:<br/><br/>1) does the river pulse enhance or hinders estuarine circulation?<br/>2) what is the transverse structure of the exchange flow at the estuary/ocean transition before, during and after the freshwater pulse?<br/>3) what is the shape and extent of the outflow plume?<br/><br/>These three objectives will advance basic understanding of estuarine processes, of processes of water exchange between ocean and estuary and of plume hydrodynamics. Data will be collected in two modes: with hydrographic surveys and with moored instrumentation. Surveys will examine the plume characteristics on the inner continental shelf and will include towing an acoustic Doppler current profiler and a surface temperature-salinity sensor. Surveys will also include profiles of temperature and salinity and will be targeted to characterize the extent and shape of the plume, as well as the stratification and flow characteristics associated with it. Also to determine the temporal reach of the plume influence, current profilers will be deployed (moored) in the estuary, at the ocean/estuary transition and over the inner shelf. These instruments are expected to address questions 1) and 2). They will be deployed before the river pulse arrives at the lower estuary and will remain moored for a month. These instruments are expected to record the horizontal and vertical characteristics of the plume and how those characteristics change over time. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will support and train one graduate student at the University of Florida and will involve the participation of at least 5 others in the field work. They will all become well versed in the operation of state-of-the-art oceanographic equipment. The results should be innovative enough to produce publishable manuscripts."

The variation of density enables the propagation of internal waves - waves in the interior of the fluid - not on its surface. These waves, as they propagate, can deform and break and, when they do, they mix fluid of different densities, changing the medium in which they propagate. A competing effect is mixing engendered by shear instabilities. This project will develop a mathematical methodology for the study of the evolution of fully nonlinear sheared, stratified flows, with the goal to understand and model the dynamics leading to fluid mixing. The wave and shear-generated mixing will be addressed with tools in the theory of systems of finite and infinitely many conservation laws. We shall calculate and study exact nonlinear solutions that break - especially simple waves of the system, general criteria for the nonlinear stability of systems of mixed type, and the statistical description of incomplete systems, based on the maximization of a coarse-grained mixing entropy.<br/><br/>This research is concerned with the propagation of waves and the dynamics of shear in atmospheric and oceanic flows and how these phenomena mix the fluid in which they exist. Mixing in geophysical flows is a crucial component of climate dynamics. The rate of mixing of ocean waters, for instance, determines the temperature at the surface, which communicates directly with the atmosphere, affecting our weather and climate. The dispersion and mixing of chemicals, carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere, on the other hand, has a profound effect on the radiative balance leading to predictions for climate change. Waves are also an element of atmospheric teleconnection: they can have long range effects since they carry energy over long distances without transporting the fluid itself. Since the length scales in which the waves and the mixing processes occur are too small and fast to be computed together with planetary scale flows, they are nowadays represented by a low number of aggregate parameters (parameterized) using simple criteria. A better understanding of the dynamics and mixing processes will improve these parameterizations and the reliability of the climate models that use them."

The approach is to extend a relational database engine with sophisticated and powerful methods for querying on sequences. Extending a relational database engine, rather than build a stand-alone sequence query processing tool, is a much more challenging task, but is essential as it allows the end-user to combine the power of analytical facilities already provided by SQL engines with the added ability to query sequences. A crucial aspect of this approach is to have a clean query algebra that provides a powerful set of biological sequence querying features, and can be accommodated within the framework of an extended relational model. SEQ will be implemented by extending the existing Postgres database engine. The collaboration between the investigators (computer scientists and biomedical researchers) will also facilitate actual deployment of the SEQ system in a project that will analyze various genomes for transcriptional regulatory elements related to genes essential for eye development and visual function. The key intellectual contribution of this proposal is in the development of a declarative querying tool for managing biological sequence data sets in a relational framework. This effort naturally requires designing and implementing methods that span most of the layers of a relational database engine, including query algebra, query language, query processing algorithms, data storage methods, and query optimization methods. The SEQ project will lead to new computer science methods for sequence query processing in each of these database management aspects. A current preliminary prototype clearly demonstrates the tremendous functionality and performance benefits of these aspects in the SEQ approach. In addition to the contributions that SEQ will make to computer science research, the project will also directly assist in the analysis of downstream targets for a transcription factor critical for rod photoreceptor development and function. The broader impacts of this proposal are in enabling life scientists to query and manage sequence data using declarative and efficient querying methods, and to enable the processing of complex sequence queries with traditional relational querying. The project will result in a free open-source OSI-certified release of the SEQ system using the ECL license. This release will allow the entire life sciences community to leverage these powerful querying methods. We note that a number of model organism databases are starting to use relational databases (often Postgres) for managing sequence data; as an example see the Chado schema used by GMOD. Sequence analysis tools are very applicable to this broader range of users as the system will essentially add complex sequence querying functionality (with efficient performance) to Postgres. The broader impacts of this proposal include enhancing the nascent bioinformatics curriculum at the University of Michigan. The project will result in cross-training computer science PhD students in life sciences research, and include the training of at least one women PhD. This project will allow undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral staff, and faculty in the EECS department and the Kellogg's Eye Center at the University of Michigan to foster a close interaction in the methods that span the disciplines of computer science and genetics."

This project aims to understand what triggers intergroup conflict, or, more precisely, what the researchers call ?faultlines,? among stakeholders engaged in cyberinfrastructure development projects and, more specifically, in GENI, a virtual laboratory currently being prototyped to explore future internets at scale. Early identification of potential faultlines and their mitigation or repair are central to achieving positive stakeholder interactions and project success. <br/><br/>The research will consist of an in-depth longitudinal study of the social networks emerging in the GENI development and prototyping community over the next three years, using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. Social Network Analysis (SNA) will be used to understand the communication patterns among stakeholders, primarily based on electronic communications, e.g., email and wiki postings. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) will be used to discern patterns in qualitative data, for example, from interviews, meeting minutes or project documents. The GENI social network will be studied at two levels, within development teams and across them ? at the larger GENI community level. <br/><br/>The management of large-scale IT development projects is challenging, in large part due to their sheer scale, scope and complexity. As a result, this research could have broad applicability. Understanding how conflict can be anticipated, avoided or mitigated has the potential to positively impact project stakeholders as well as the broader society, which is the ultimate beneficiary of the innovations that GENI may stimulate."

To be sensitive to extremely faint sounds, the auditory system must detect movements at a scale comparable to atomic dimensions. This project will explore how the inner ear achieves its remarkable sensitivity. In particular, measurements will be made of the movements of hair cells, specialized cells that detect mechanical signals from incoming sound waves and convert them into electrical signals sent to the brain. Using an internal auditory organ from the frog, the tissue will be placed in the appropriate chemical environment, and movements with be recorded with a high-speed camera. The hypothesis is that the response will show synchronization (i.e., that the cells will move in unison when given a mechanical stimulus) which can serve to explain the extreme sensitivity of the whole organ. The goal is to determine how interactions between individual elements affect the behavior of the whole sensor, and thus help answer one of the long-open problems in auditory neuroscience. The project will serve to train graduate and undergraduate students in techniques at the interface of physics and sensory neuroscience, which will be complemented by new courses specifically designed for this purpose and recently introduced into the departmental curriculum."

One of the main gaps in evolutionary ecology is to understand how the configuration of visual systems influences the costs and benefits of information gathering. This is particularly interesting in visually oriented animals that live in groups, such as birds, because their visual environments are complex, as they can use two sources of information (personal and social) that can affect an individual's fitness (e.g., predator detection), and eventually social interactions (e.g., group size, neighbor distance). For instance, an animal can detect a predator through its own vigilance behavior (personal information) or through the anti-predator behavior of flock mates (social information). The goal of this project is to study how two key visual capacities (visual acuity and the extent of the visual fields) affect anti-predator behavioral responses in social foraging scenarios using four bird species as models: House Finch Carpodacus mexicanus, House Sparrow Passer domesticus, Brown-headed Cowbird Molothrus ater, and European Starling Sturnus vulgaris. The general hypothesis is that the degree to which visual social information is used to minimize vulnerability to predation will depend upon a trade-off between visual acuity and visual fields. Two predictions will be tested. First, species with relatively wide and less acute vision will exhibit less high-quality (head-up) scanning than species with relatively narrow and more acute vision due to greater visual coverage. Second, predator detection in species with relatively wide and less acute visual systems will be limited by the distance to the predator due to their reduced depth of vision; whereas in species with relatively narrow visual fields and more acute vision, predator detection will be limited by body posture and head-orientation due to their more constrained visual coverage. This study will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in anti-predator behavior in species with different visual systems, which may have influenced the evolution of vision in passerine birds. New knowledge bringing together sensory biology and behavioral ecology will be produced and communicated to the scientific community through inter-disciplinary peer-reviewed journals and meetings, involving graduate and undergraduate students as coauthors, and to lay audiences through a non-technical publication. Research will be integrated with teaching through different activities with the general goal of heightening the interest of minorities in evolutionary biology. First, minority high school, undergraduate, and graduate students will be involved in the project. Second, new lecture and lab modules will be developed on the evolution of avian sensory systems. Third, outreach seminars will be given at high schools in communities with high representation of minorities to show the similarities and differences between human and avian vision and how these affect behavior. Fourth, a webpage will be developed emphasizing the relevance of inter-disciplinary research in sensory and behavioral ecology to understand the evolution of visual systems."

The formation of prismatic dislocation loops (dislocation loops whose Burgers vector has a component normal to their plane) is widely believed to be an important factor leading to radiation damage in metals. With the growing interest in nuclear energy, there is a compelling need to understand the properties of these defects and their influence on the structural properties of materials. This project undertakes a fundamental study through quantum mechanically informed calculations to probe into various aspects of prismatic dislocation loops, which include nucleation, growth and migration of these defects, and their influence on the structural properties of materials. In order to conduct these studies, the investigator will develop coarse-graining techniques that enable electronic structure calculations at macroscopic scales. <br/><br/>Development of the proposed coarse-graining techniques will bridge the materials science and mechanics viewpoints of materials behavior, which will have a transformative impact in facilitating the design and development of new multi-functional materials. The physical insights provided by this project can guide the design of new materials which provide enhanced performance under radiation exposed extreme thermo-mechanical environments. Moreover, this project will provide education and training for a diverse group of students in a highly interdisciplinary field on the interface of materials physics, applied mathematics, mechanics, and high-performance computing."

The vast majority of diseases enter the human population through pathogen transfer from animals. The example of a human-acquired primate virus, which mutated to HIV serves as the underlying motivation for this project. Understanding the social and geographic contexts for human acquisition of animal pathogens will enable the interruption of pathogen exchange. The research setting for this research is Kibale Forest National Park in western Uganda, which serves as an epicenter of primate biodiversity and a focus of human-primate interaction. Conflicting goals of conservation and human livelihood over the preservation versus utilization of the environment, result in significant pressure on primate populations. This applies both to those living in the park and especially those inhabiting small, highly degraded patches of forest outside protected areas. This pressure leads to increased interaction between people and primates, and as interaction increases, so does the risk of pathogen transfer. This research analyzes the ecological and social factors that cause people-primate interaction around forest patches. It investigates the impact that human activities and spaces play in relation to primate habitat on human health. Health and behavior surveys combined with maps of activity spaces provide the data to test for meaningful relationships between disease, activities and spaces of people and primates. Further data will be generated through interviews with key informants. These interviews provide the project with the political, economic, and social structures behind human activities and spaces. The investigators expect to find structural elements shaping human activities and dictating activity spaces; and that activity spaces shared with primates significantly impact human health. <br/><br/>This project extends current research focused on the biophysical processes of cross-species pathogen transmission. By pursuing two goals simultaneously - one that explores associations between primate exposure and risk of infectious disease and the other to understand structural factors that inform such exposures - we respond to gaps in contemporary cross-species disease research. Refining the spatial relationship between human activities, primate habitat, and health will provide the global community with a geographic context for emerging cross-species disease. Moreover, articulating the nuances of social, political and economic structures mediating transmission dynamics addresses the complex effects of social structure on disease ecology. Flexible interview methods allow underrepresented groups to voice health and conservation concerns. Understanding the social and spatial conditions that promote disease transmission is vital for predicting and preventing the emergence and spread of potentially pandemic cross-species diseases."

In the first part, the principal investigator will work on various questions related to the appearance of singularities in solutions of the equations of fluid dynamics and other nonlinear partial differential equations. In mathematics this is connected with one of the famous Clay problems. The PI has already established some results in the area. These were obtained with the help of the so-called renormalization group method, which is one of the main methods in the theory of dynamical systems and allows one to study various kinds of singularities of solutions. The project will consider new types of boundary problems and other types of nonlinear partial differential equations. This part of the project might also require some numerical studies. The second part of the project will focus on several problems from ergodic theory related to number theory. This includes the statistics of values of linear forms on small scales and problems related to the famous Littlewood conjecture and the distribution of large Frobenius numbers. One must stress that the ensembles and probability distributions that arise in this context are quite different from the ones in traditional probability theory and require new ideas and new methods.<br/><br/>The first major component of the project deals with partial differential equations, which represent one of the principal mechanisms for providing mathematical models of physical phenomena. Of special interest in this project are equations that arise in fluid dynamics and that have application to the study of such traumatic events as hurricanes and tornadoes. The second key component of this project focuses on ergodic theory. Ergodic theory is an area of mathematics in which the subjects of probability and dynamical systems come together. It, too, has applications to real-world phenomena, predictions of weather, climate change, and earthquakes, to mention just a few. Ergodic theory usually develops in conjunction with many important parts of mathematics. It is expected that the progress in ergodic theory that will be made in this project will have an impact on our understanding of many important events in nature and find possible application in other scientific disciplines such as physics and geology."

She will focus her research on the growing trend of brokered transnational marriages between Japanese men and Chinese women. In particular, she will investigate how social and familial obligations, gender ideologies, Sino-Japanese historical relations, and current economic inequalities influence the production and navigation of new forms of family organization at a transnational level.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, preliminary research suggests that participants in these marriages frame their relations as a form of intra-community (rather than inter-community) marriage. To do so, they draw upon racial, cultural, regional, and even genealogical discourses in an effort to create similarities and obscure power inequalities and historical antagonisms. To further investigate how participants, brokers, and family members conceptualize these marriages in the context of economic disparities and contentious national discourses, the researcher will conduct field research in both Japan and China. She will employ multiple social science research methods, including participant observation, in-depth interviews, clientele surveys, and media analysis. <br/><br/>The research is important because it will contribute to social science theory about the relationships between globalization and social change. While it is clear that globalization is not, as once predicted, making all societies the same, it is also clear that globalization is producing hitherto unknown forms of kinship and family. Comparative local-level ethnographic research will help social scientists better understand what these new forms are and how they are produced. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist."

The early work in this field was devoted primarily to the physics and chemistry of phase-controlled optical fields to control unimolecular processes such as dissociation and ionization in the gas phase. In the intervening decade, the field has grown much larger, encompassing quantum coherence aspects in sub-femtosecond laser physics, ultrafast x-ray physics and materials science, quantum information science, as well as gas and liquid phase coherent control of chemical reactions. The conference includes people from several sub-disciplines of AMO Physics and Physical Chemistry, including those working with cold degenerate atomic gases, femtosecond and attosecond pulses, ultra-high laser fields, high harmonics, solid state physics, ultrafast x-rays, and applied mathematics for control problems. <br/><br/>The objective of the conference is to bring together internationally leading scientists as well as young researchers and students active (or particularly interested) in the field of quantum control. As such, it has an impact far beyond the scholarly benefit to the participants. The conference has become the most important world forum for new research results and trends in this rapidly expanding field. The interdisciplinary character of the field contributes to this broad impact, and this will be emphasized."

Materials of interest include polyurethanes, conductive polymers, and ceramic pastes. As a result of this proposed work, the acoustics and droplet formation physical phenomena will be identified at multiple length and time scales. Computational fluid dynamics models will be developed that capture microscopic details of the ejection process. This knowledge will be used to create design guidelines for the new ultrasonic droplet deposition manufacturing technology. <br/>If successful, this research could benefit society by enabling manufacturing technologies that can print a wide range of materials for applications ranging from complex, multi-material thermoplastic parts to photovoltaics, fuel injectors and vaccine delivery systems. Overcoming the limitations of current printing technologies will have a transformational effect on the additive manufacturing and potentially the ink-jet printing industries, since a much wider range of materials will be printable. Graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented groups will be recruited for this project. The proposed work will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by developing and maintaining facilities for atomization experiments and for part fabrication.

Carbon fibers of various diameters enhance a broad range of materials and products to increase the strength-to-weight ratio and improve thermal and electrical properties of composite structures. However, a substantial gap in available fiber diameters exists between the largest nanofiber (100 nm) and the smallest microfiber (3000 nm). A similar gap exists in the aspect ratio of the fibers. Laboratory demonstrations have shown the NGJ process produces fibers that fill these gaps. The objectives of this project are to develop the equipment and procedures that demonstrate the high volume and low cost advantages of NGJ nanofibers reproducibly in important applications. This project consists of 1) design and fabrication of pilot scale equipment, 2) production and characterization of nanofibers, 3) preparation of composite samples, and 4) comparison of composites reinforced with NJG nanofibers to those reinforced with commercially available nanofibers. The results of this research will prove the advantages of the NGJ nanofibers and their commercial viability. <br/><br/>Completion of this project will provide an understanding of the impact of larger diameter, higher aspect ratio carbon nanofibers on composite polymer performance. Additionally, the design and optimization of composite components and the process controls of fabrication will be improved by the availability of a wide range of diameters of the graphitic reinforcing nanofibers fibers. Also, fundamental morphological differences will be revealed in the way that graphene-like sheets are arranged in fibers of varying diameters produced by the NGJ process. This project will lead to the commercialization of low cost, high performance carbon nanofibers with unique mechanical properties. Benefits to society from these materials will include lighter weight, higher strength components utilized in most automobiles, which will reduce fuel consumption. Also, when used as affordable high performance fillers in lithium ion battery electrodes, these carbon nanofibers will help electric cars achieve mass appeal. Additional benefits will arise from the significant performance improvements and cost reductions that occur as the low cost, high performance materials are incorporated into manufacturing processes, packaging products, adhesives, and many other supply chain materials.<br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."

In response, males employ a variety of mechanisms to bias their fertilization success, such as incapacitation. However, the importance of incapacitation as a mechanism for sperm precedence is controversial because it is unclear how a male can damage a rival?s ejaculate without also damaging his own. To evaluate the utility of incapacitation and identify its agents, a system is needed in which genetic differences between competitors? ejaculates can be identified. Stalk-eyed flies provide such a system. In Cyrtodiopsis whitei, sperm from males that produce unbiased sex ratios incapacitate sperm from males that produce female-biased sex ratios caused by X chromosome meiotic drive. In this project, we conduct two complementary studies using this system: a test of the robust nature of incapacitation and a molecular characterization of proteins associated with incapacitation. To assess the strength of incapacitation, adult diet is manipulated using a population and protocols developed at University College London and drive and non-drive males are competed in an in vitro sperm viability assay developed at University of Maryland. Analysis of variance is performed across treatments on live/dead sperm counts. A priori, drive males are expected to overcome incapacitation in the low protein diet treatment due to changes in protein composition caused by dietary stress to non-drive males. The molecular portion of the project is conducted at the University of Maryland and focuses on identifying changes in ejaculatory protein profiles associated with incapacitation. A portion of this work includes the construction of expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries from testes and male accessory glands. Tandem mass spectroscopy is performed on three different combinations of seminal vesicle/accessory gland samples as well as an internal standard to identify protein profiles. Tandem mass spectroscopy results are compared to EST libraries and differences between treatments in protein composition and expression are quantified to identify candidate incapacitation genes.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the proposed work include advanced training for the postdoctoral fellow and University of Maryland undergraduate students. In addition, the project fosters international collaboration between the postdoctoral fellow and two senior investigators in the UK and US. Results from this study have the potential to provide insight into sperm development and dysfunction, which have biomedical relevance for understanding causes of male infertility. Finally, a large amount of DNA sequence information is deposited in online repositories, thereby enhancing the ability of other investigators to conduct comparative genomic studies."

This project addresses research toward greater understanding and implementing ar-rangement of materials at shrinking dimensions, and the ability to successfully integrate new ma-terials with better properties or materials that would provide new functionalities. The project aims for advanced processing methods that can organize materials at nano-scale dimensions with precise placement having the necessary quality and reliability, for example, to realize concepts for new types of device structures involving single electron tunneling effects (transistors, mem-ory, quantum cellular automata), quantum computing architectures, and integration of III-V ma-terials with group IV substrates for high-speed channels or optical devices. Self-assembly meth-ods alone can arrange structures at these length scales, but cannot place structures at specific lo-cations. The approach is to combine self assembly with a top-down patterning method to direct growth. The project seeks to create topographic templates made up of uniform and size-selecting features through a 'strain-engineering' mechanism. These templates will then be used to nucleate high quality, crystalline nanostructures at specified locations on substrates by self-assembly methods that would occur on the templates. This is expected to provide a route to creating new structures with an arbitrary lateral arrangement and the potential for combining lattice mis-matched materials with silicon that would not be achievable through thin film growth with high quality. Strained SixGe1-x layers will be grown on silicon substrates that have been locally modi-fied at specific sites using a focused ion beam, resulting in pyramidal pit formation at each site with a characteristic size, dependent on strain. The pit edges will be used to provide four closely spaced nucleation sites. Studies will be done on how the template formation is influenced by various patterning parameters and by kinetics during heteroepitaxial growth using ultra high vac-uum sputtering. Studies will also be done to determine how these templates can be used to influ-ence the growth of dissimilar materials under different kinetic conditions. The growth of lattice-mismatched semiconductors (Ge on Si) as well as other materials such as silicides will be ex-plored. Characterization studies will be done to understand the effects on resulting morphology, crystal/interface structure, composition, and uniformity?items which will influence electrical properties and the potential usefulness for device applications. These studies will also include the effect of very small surface discontinuities, defects, or impurities on nucleation processes in technologically important material systems. <br/>Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of elec-tronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. In addition to graduate student participation, undergraduates will also be directly involved and gain hands-on experience using advanced research tools. Increasing undergraduate research participation at early stages in their education will be a primary focus, with particular encouragement given to women and minori-ties. This undergraduate research will be leveraged to help promote these activities to local high schools, by demonstrating examples of practical hands-on research they will have the opportu-nity to participate in as engineering students. Connections will be made to industry by providing additional examples to students. Many aspects of this research will also be incorporated into new nanotechnology and electromagnetic properties courses and used as supplemental research pro-jects associated with other courses to integrate research and education more effectively."

Canadian unionization rates are now more than twice as high as in the U.S. The problem is even more puzzling when one considers that Canadian and U.S. workers share many of the same unions, and work for many of the same employers, which operate in very similar economic environments. Prior research on the U.S. and Canada unionization divergence has either too narrowly focused on proximate causes without seeking to understand their historical and institutional context, or too broadly identified essential differences in political cultures without specifying mechanisms linking cultural differences with institutional configurations and policy outcomes. This project examines the historical conditions surrounding labor policy formation and development in both countries, with a special emphasis on variations in the relative permeability of state institutions. The central research hypothesis is that more permeable state institutions in the U.S. allowed labor to have their policy goals incorporated into state policy more easily than their Canadian counterparts, but at the expense of creating a labor policy that was more politically contested and less institutionally stable over time. In contrast, the greater impermeability of Canadian state institutions forced unions to fight for labor policy reform from the outside. While this made it more difficult initially for Canadian unions to achieve their policy goals, once labor's political pressure brought protective labor legislation within the purview of state action, the same institutional impermeability had the effect of shielding Canadian labor?s gains, creating a policy regime that was less politically contested and more institutionally stable.<br/><br/>Given established links between union strength and outcomes such as welfare policies, political landscapes, and socio-economic inequality, this research into the causes of diverging union strength can deepen our understanding of forces driving a much broader set of social indicators. At a more theoretical and scientific level, this study uses the empirical case of U.S. and Canadian unionization divergence to offer important insights into still poorly understood processes of institutional formation and development. Additionally, thanks to labor unions? unique position as organizations that operate both within and outside state institutions, this study allows us to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the complex interplay between state institutions, social mobilization, and government action. Finally, at a methodological level, this study highlights the importance of incorporating temporal analysis as a critical means understanding cross-national institutional differences."

The discovery of this novel reactivity, mediated by an organic catalyst, of a-heteroatomic and a,b-unsaturated aldehydes opens a broad range of mechanistically unique pathways for the synthesis of chiral carboxylic acid derivatives, including anti-b-hydroxyesters and b-amino peptides. The design and application of chiral heterocyclic salts for catalyzing this novel process will provide an enantioselective method for directly controlling the absolute stereochemistry concomitant with esterifications and peptide couplings, and has the potential to supplant traditional multi-step chiral auxiliary based methodologies. By developing means of effecting the direct, enantioselective synthesis of amides from a,b-didehydroamino aldehydes, a waste-free, atom-economical approach to the synthesis of poly-a-amino-peptides from achiral precursors will emerge.

The goals of this research are to achieve greater understanding of synthesis and processing of new types of crystalline silicon and silicon nanostructures, to characterize their basic electronic and optical properties, and to explore their utility in prototype devices. The silicon in common use is an indirect-bandgap semiconductor with a diamond crystal structure. While there have been significant efforts in searching for materials compatible with current silicon technology and/or materials that could be integrated with silicon for improved performance, this project explores the silicon wurtzite crystal structure; silicon quantum wells (QWs) and superlattices (SLs) made of layers of wurtzite silicon and regular diamond silicon will be studied. Stable wurtzite silicon was prepared 45 years ago using high-pressure indentation. The results of previous experiments and theoretical studies have supported the conclusion that wurtzite silicon has a lower bandgap than diamond silicon, but an accurate knowledge of the wurtzite silicon bandgap is still lacking because of difficulties in material preparation and measurement. This project addresses basic material synthesis, processing, and characterization, as well as prototype device realization. Wurtzite silicon characteristics, such as bandgap and band offset with diamond silicon will be obtained. The project will also utilize nanowires as a platform for the study of new types of crystalline silicon and silicon heterostructures. Because of the lower bandgap of wurtzite silicon and the intimate integration of wurtzite silicon with diamond silicon, new silicon devices may have significantly enhanced performance and functionality. The structure-modulated nanostructures, silicon QWs and SLs, may provide new ways to achieve enhanced optical and electronic properties of silicon and open up new opportunities in basic research and device possibilities. <br/>Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. Successful synthesis and demonstration of the new nanostructures and prototype devices could revolutionize the silicon industry to some degree. Results from this project will be disseminated through publications, conference presentations, and the PI's Web site. Research results will also be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate courses that the PI teaches. New types of infrared solar cells based on wurtzite silicon are expected to be one of the term projects for students (graduate students or senior undergraduate students). One or two high school teachers are expected to join the PI's research group during each summer session and to actively participate in research. These teachers will be sponsored by Cullen College of Engineering's Summer Research program for greater Houston high school math and science teachers (http://www.egr.uh.edu/ret). The program is designed to include 12 bright teachers with enthusiasm for research that is subsequently shared with their respective high school classes during the school year. Teachers will be recruited from the Houston metro area, with at least one half of the participants coming from HISD (the Houston Independent School District). The recruitment plan will yield not only a diverse group of teacher participants but will also impact ethnically and socio-economically diverse students in the participants' high school courses; 38% of HISD students are African American, 58% are Hispanic, and 82% qualify for free or reduced lunch. Because of the diversity of teachers, the training and experiences obtained by teachers is expected to have a broad influence on a diverse body of students, especially minority students. This project will also directly benefit K-12 education. The Greater Houston area is among the largest and most diverse metropolitan areas in the nation. This diversity is reflected in the student body of the Harmony Science Academy, a charter school in Houston (http://hsahouston.org/) with which the PI has established a partnership. Through this partnership, high school students from the academy will spend after-school hours in the PI's lab, working on projects related to nanotechnology and energy. Their research results will be presented in the annual I-SWEEEP conference that will be held at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston."

The technical goal is to detail the limits of validity of reported flow instabilities in entangled polymer melts and solutions.  The flow of polymer fluids in conventional rheometers is generally assumed to be nearly viscometric and stable. When instability or secondary flows occur, it is generally acknowledged that such measurements cannot be used to determine material parameters.  This is important in any experimental challenge to, e.g., a molecular theory such as the reptation model of polymer chain dynamics.  According to a new set of results that has appeared in the literature, the basis for the experimental verification of the reptation theory is, in fact, based upon experiments from non-homogeneous flows.  If this is true, it changes the paradigm for the dynamics of polymer fluids in nonlinear deformation regimes.  However, much of the community is skeptical of these results and there are multiple reports in the literature of contradictory results. Hence, it is paramount to establish the range of both flow conditions (rate and magnitude of shear) and material parameters (e.g., entanglement density) for which such observations are correct and the range where errors may have been made and to do so in a way that the results are accepted by the community at large.  The present proposal is constructed to do this.  The groups collaborate through an innovative set of student teams having one representative from at least three institutions for all experiments. Success of the work is defined as achieving an interlaboratory consensus of the flow profiles in polymer solutions and melts.  Objectivity is developed by having multiple labs with multiple students performing each type of experiment so that ?neutral eyes? have the major influence in the examination of experimental data.  Three types of experiments will be performed, each will be performed in at least two labs and one will be performed in all labs.  The experiments are particle tracking velocimetry, confocal microscopy fluorescence dye velocimetry and macroscopic parallel plate-cone and plate comparisons of nonlinear properties.  <br/><br/> <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The major paradigm of polymer rheology is the reptation theory. Because reptation is the present paradigm for polymer flow, it is widely used in industrial settings to understand how to change molecular parameters in making advances in polymer processing.  There are several offshoots to reptation theory as well that are beginning to be adopted in industry. Yet, recent work has appeared that is being strongly advanced to challenge this paradigm. It has reported strong flow instabilities which would invalidate the reptation theory in the regime relevant to polymer processing.  Hence establishing whether or not the reported flow instabilities occur in industrially relevant ranges of flow rates is important. The present proposal brings together collaborators from four U.S. and one foreign university (Texas Tech University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cornell University and Illinois Institute of Technology,Technical University of Eindhoven in the Netherlands) with the goal of establishing the range of experimental conditions where such flow instabilities occur.  Because the general community has not uniformly accepted the reported results, the present collaboration will provide both repeat (for validation purposes) and novel experimentation to establish the range over which the reported results are relevant and how they impact the current understanding of polymer nonlinear rheology and its basis in molecular (reptation) theory.  The present proposal does this. In addition, because of its structure as a collaborative work through an innovative set of student teams having one representative from at least three institutions for all experiments.  All students will participate in the collaboration with the Technical University of Eindhoven.<br/>"

Himmelfarb, under the direction of Dr. J. Peter Brosius, will examine the long-term effects of involuntary displacement on food security. Governments around the world enact projects that displace millions of people each year. It is important for both policy and social science theory to investigate the social dynamics of how men and women construct new livelihoods and lifeways in the face of displacement and resettlement. This research will address two overarching questions: (1) Does forced displacement establish relationships of inequality that constrain displaced people's access to resources and livelihood opportunities? (2) If so, do these inequalities produce vulnerability to seasonal food shortages? <br/><br/>The research will be carried out in the Benet Resettlement Area, located on the margins of Mt. Elgon National Park, Uganda. Using a comparative research design and a combination of qualitative ethnographic data and quantitative assessments of food insecurity, the researcher will compare livelihood activities, access to resources, relative food security, and strategies for coping with food insecurity in displaced and non-displaced communities.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to social science theory about human social resilience and adaptation by adding a long-term perspective to the study of displacement. The project also will directly aid policy planners in more effectively addressing the impacts of previous policies and designing more socially and economically sensitive resettlement initiatives in the future. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist."

According to research on ethnic economies, ethnic solidarity can facilitate entrepreneurship by helping business owners cut costs and expedite the search for goods, services, and employees.  Many researchers of ethnic economies have overlooked the role of religion in business and assumed that ethnic solidarity is the most significant determinant of beneficial network ties.  Meanwhile it is likely that religion also plays an influential role in the ethnic economy.  Religious texts include discussions of business ethics, and religious institutions facilitate solidarity through worship services, group meetings, and social events.  Research also suggests that some religious tenets correlate with entrepreneurial success.  With this study, the co-investigator will place religion at center stage in the research of ethnic economies by answering the following questions: How does religion influence ethnic entrepreneurship?  How does religious identity shape network formation in the immigrant economy?  When immigrants have crosscutting religious and ethnic ties, what types of networks are they drawn to?  For example, do Iraqi Muslims tend to develop networks with other Muslims regardless of country of origin, or with other Iraqis regardless of religion?  The investigator will conduct 120 interviews with Iraqi, Palestinian, and Lebanese entrepreneurs of Muslim and Christian faiths, who own businesses in Metropolitan Detroit.  Semi-structured interviews will be used to collect data on each business owner?s network members and on the role of religion and ethnicity in the life of the business owner. <br/><br/>This research has the potential to reform theories of ethnic economies by demonstrating the important role of religion in network formation.  Religious diversity and the saliency of religion are increasing, which makes these findings on the influence of religion in business valuable to future studies both in the U.S. and abroad.  Finally, this research is significant not only because it focuses on Arab Americans, an underrepresented group, but also because it highlights the rich ethnic and religious diversity within a group that is commonly presented as monolithic."

Early identification of potential faultlines and their mitigation or repair are central to achieving positive stakeholder interactions and project success.<br/><br/>The research will consist of an in-depth longitudinal study of the social networks emerging in the GENI development and prototyping community over the next three years, using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. Social Network Analysis (SNA) will be used to understand the communication patterns among stakeholders, primarily based on electronic communications, e.g., email and wiki postings. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) will be used to discern patterns in qualitative data, for example, from interviews, meeting minutes or project documents. The GENI social network will be studied at two levels, within development teams and across them ? at the larger GENI community level. <br/><br/>The management of large-scale IT development projects is challenging, in large part due to their sheer scale, scope and complexity. As a result, this research could have broad applicability.

One aspect is the interpretation of Langlands duality of reductive groups in terms of homotopy theory (in the framework of Derived Algebraic Geometry). Another aspect is a continuation of the work on developing a particular geometric Koszul duality (``Linear Koszul Duality'') and applying it to representation theory. In relation to physics, the project envisions a mathematical formalism of t'Hooft operators and a construction of a certain extended topological field theory in four dimensions, with applications to knot theory. The project also contains a speculation on the relation of number theory and physics. Here, a geometrization of number theory is expected to arise through a connection to quantum field theory. <br/><br/>The project aims towards relating and unifying developments in mathematics and theoretical particle physics. The origin of these developments in mathematics is the so called Langlands program, which is the modern view on a classical discipline of number theory. In time this program incorporated a number of central disciplines of mathematics, starting with representation theory, then algebraic geometry and currently the homotopy theory. The relation to physics is a part of the current melting of barriers between mathematics and physics which arose in a period when the two subjects developed separately. The central impact on mathematics in the last quarter century was the import of the ideas from quantum field theory (in particular string theory), which is the part of physics that studies elementary particles. Recently, Witten, Kapustin and Gukov established a long sought bridge between Langlands program and quantum field theory (in particular gauge theory and string theory). The proposed work attempts to work in both directions by applying ideas from physics to mathematics and mathematical constructions to physics. It also aims towards deeper understanding of the relation between quantum field theory and number theory. The proposal also contains more standard topics within representation theory and Langlands program."

This project will examine the loss of sexual reproducing in a species of hornwort growing in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. These asexual hornworts were thought to be an endemic species restricted to the Appalachians. But recently other members of the species were found in Costa Rica, and in that locale the species reproduces sexually.

This collaborative project addresses materials science growth/processing research of InGaAs/GaAsSb multiple quantum wells (MQW) with related investigations aimed toward mid-IR wavelength detector applications. The nature of the band alignment allows tuning of the en-ergy gap by varying layer thickness, strain, and composition. Emphasis is placed on gaining greater understanding of the trap formation in GaInAs/GaAsSb MQWs and correlation of their formation with prototype device performance. The approach involves the use of InP to provide advantages: these include the use of compressive and tensile strained materials for flexible device design options; mature wafer foundry capabilities for processing InP-based structures; the ability to leverage advances in InP-based epi-growth over the past decade; and the ability to leverage fu-ture advances driven by InP electronics. Currently, device performance apppears limited by mid-gap traps in the absorption region; hence this work is focused on providing a more complete un-derstanding of these traps and correlating them with device performance. While the MIR photo-diode test structure used in this work has its merit from device perspectives, the basic under-standing of trap states in GaInAs, GaAsSb, and GaInAs/GaAsSb MQWs will improve our fun-damental understanding of these materials. In turn, this will help to better understand the nature of the Sb-based MQW structure. Additionally, these MQWs also impact other important devices such as heterojunction bipolar transistors and mid-IR semiconductor lasers. <br/>Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of elec-tronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. Societal benefits of the pro-posed research of these materials are potentially broad since the materials and prototype devices being studied support civilian and military applications including pollution detection, medical di-agnostics, night vision, and missile tracking. At present, the best detectors are based on band-to-band transitions in HgCdTe or quantum-well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) using III-V com-pound semiconductors. Neither technology is well-suited for operation at or near room-temperature. An important advantage of InGaAs/GaAsSb MQW detectors is the potential for high detectivity at relatively high temperatures (200-300K). Through their participation in state-of-the-art research both graduate and undergraduate students will gain invaluable skills and better understand the connection between materials growth, characterization, device design, and device fabrication. To show the impact of mid-IR photodiodes on applications, the photodiodes devel-oped will be used in a trace-gas monitoring demonstration platform. This platform will be used in outreach programs (Engineering Open House; a summer program called Introduction to Engi-neering (ITE); and ENGR 162 (UVA) and EG EG10111/10112 (Notre Dame) required first year engineering courses) designed to illustrate the societal benefits of Electrical Engineering.

Industry and academia alike are designing and implementing languages, runtime systems, and architectures to enable and leverage this shift. One of the foremost technologies to emerge from this effort is transactional memory (TM). Transactional memory offers a new paradigm for expressing general-purpose multithreaded applications safely and efficiently. Although much research effort has focused on implementing transactions, relatively less emphasis has been placed on the problem of defining appropriate programming models for transactional memory. This is a research problem of great practical interest, but also significant difficulty, as its interconnected components span the traditional areas of language implementation (compilers), language design, and software engineering.<br/><br/>This research explores the issue of programming models for transactional memory. First, the investigators evaluate and refine a programming model for allowing a transaction to perform irreversible operations and to coordinate with other threads. The main concept is that of ""transaction punctuation"" and supports controlled relaxation of transactional guarantees and local reasoning about the effects of other threads. Second, the research examines a hybrid programming model, where a transactional implementation is fitted on a lock-like interface. This approach is suitable both for existing lock-based applications, and for new ones where the programmer has the ability to label critical sections with specific locks. The result is an adaptive combination of the performance advantages of both locks and transactions. Finally, the inestigators study ""open-nesting"" transactional programming models. Open-nesting is a TM model offering high performance, but at the expense of significant programmer effort. The research evolves and generalizes guidelines for correct open-nesting usage, avoiding counter-intuitive behavior."

This project addresses fundamental materials science synthesis/processing research associated with the integration of high-speed electronics and highly functional sensors on flexible substrates. The primary approach is to explore ion-cutting as a means to transfer single crystalline III-V semiconductor layers onto flexible substrates. Current flexible electronics processes focus on deposited amorphous and/or polycrystalline Si on polymer substrates. Due to the limited tem-perature tolerance of polymers, the carrier mobility of these deposited layers is low and often un-acceptable for many applications even after subsequent laser annealing. The transfer research will focus on, but will not be limited to, the ion cutting technique. A major challenge is understanding ion damage, and how to reduce it in transferred layers. In this joint proposal, UCSD will focus on processing while ASU will focus on characterization. Anticipated benefits of the collaboration include: discovery of the fundamental mechanisms by which single crystalline III-V materials can be transferred to flexible substrates; and establishment of knowledge and expertise in the funda-mental mechanisms associated with synthesis/processing and characterization of devices fabri-cated from ion cut and layer transfer of semiconductor thin films. <br/>Non-Technical.

Additional support is provided by the non-profit partner, the Kenan Fund for Engineering, Technology, and Science. Representing a region that surrounds Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base, BRAC/RTF was established to unify and serve 11 counties, 73 municipalities, eight community colleges, and six state and private universities, and to help identify and advocate for their needs in partnership with the military, corporate and non-profit interests, and federal and state agencies. <br/><br/>Eighteen in-service Kenan Master Teaching Fellows (KMTF) from high-need schools in the BRAC/RTF region are completing two-year fellowships and then continuing for three years in formal Alumni activities as Master Teachers in their districts. KMTFs receive $10,000 in annual salary supplements for each of the five years they participate in the program, as well as a range of other support including intensive professional development during the first two years to ensure a rich fellowship experience. KMTFs are recruited and selected from a diverse pool of the BRAC/RTF region's most outstanding STEM teachers, who already hold master's degrees and have demonstrated excellence in teaching prior to recruitment. This elite cohort of teachers is learning about the practices and skills that characterize the innovative, high-tech labs and industries moving into the area. KMTFs work with industry or academic mentors in a particular cutting-edge research area, to learn more about important new developments and to gain an understanding of the significance of current research and scientific practice for students entering the work force and higher education. Each KMTF/ Mentor pair works to translate STEM research experiences into engaging lessons for use in North Carolina's classrooms. Fellows are creating innovative curriculum resources aligned with the NC Standard Course of Study. In Summer Institutes for Professional Development, KMTFs build advanced skills to become more effective teacher-leaders and change agents in their schools and districts. The Master Teachers are engaged in a range of leadership activities in their home districts and are involved in preservice education at the partnering institutions."

The approach is to use novel micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) techniques to miniaturize the mirror scanning mechanism and the IR detector. A unique interferometer design is also proposed to compensate mirror tilting.<br/><br/>Fourier transform spectroscopy, especially in infrared range, or FTIR, is very powerful in chemical/biosensing. However, most of FTIR systems are bulky and expensive. MEMS technology has been used to miniaturize FTIR systems, but researchers still face several challenges: low spectral resolution due to small displacements of the MEMS mirrors; tilting of scanning MEMS mirrors; and lack of small-sized uncooled IR detectors for FTIR. This research will address these challenges with several innovative techniques: a new MEMS mirror whose scan range will reach over 1 mm that is 10?e improvement compared to its counterparts; a single-mirror Michelson interferometer design capable of tilt-insensitive scanning; and a capacitive MEMS uncooled IR detector that is small, inexpensive and highly-sensitive. <br/><br/>The proposed integrated technology has a broad range of applications including homeland security, antiterrorism, food safety, and environmental monitoring. Due to their small size and low cost, such devices can be used onsite by first responders such as soldiers or border guards, so that explosives, chemical weapons, toxic hazards and biological agents can be identified quickly to prevent or minimize damage and save lives. Through this project, efforts will be made to attract more young students especially minority students into engineering and science areas."

If one wants to predict and subsequently evaluate the overall performance of a design, the ?observational method? espoused by Peck is a well-known framework wherein construction and design procedures and details are adjusted based upon observations and measurements made as construction proceeds. Adaptive management techniques allow one to automate the observational approach so that quantitative information can be distributed to interested shareholders in a timely enough fashion to be of use in a number of applications. This methodology has particular application when extending civil infrastructure into the subsurface environment. The increase in population density, as well as new imperatives for infrastructure investment, homeland security, energy conservation and sustainable design, will require major advances in our ability to create underground space more efficiently and safely. <br/><br/>Many factors affect the ground movements caused by excavations, including stratigraphy, soil properties, support system details, construction activities, contractual arrangements and workmanship. While numerical simulations have become more common when analyzing ground response to excavations as part of the design process, finite element predictions contain uncertainties related to soil properties, support system details, and construction procedures. These factors are explicitly considered when applying adaptive management methods to the problem, although the methodology has its limitations as subsequently discussed. <br/><br/>Stricter limits on allowable ground movements associated with deep excavations are being imposed in many locales by either regulatory agencies or by recognition of adverse effects of excessive ground movements. Excavations in some urban areas are being subjected to movement limitations that are much smaller than even just 5 years ago. For example, excavation-induced ground movements in the Seattle area are limited to 1 inch for cuts at deep as 70 ft. Requirements for excavations in Chicago are now targeted for maximum ground movements of 1-1/2 to 2 inches, down from 4 inches just over a decade ago. These issues are compounded in Chicago by the fact that excavations now are being made to depths of 75 ft, much deeper than the typical depth of 40 ft. Many excavations in the Boston area are limited to 1 inch of ground movement. Given that the subsurface conditions at Boston and Chicago consist of relatively soft clays, these requirements present a challenge in excavation support design and construction. Consequently, the state-of-the-art of predicting ground deformations has reached a point where major advances in practice are required to make accurate design assessments when movements are limited to such small amounts. These advances also are needed to make the adaptive management approach applicable to these types of problems.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research is to extend the adaptive management approach so that it applies to a range of problems where ground deformations must be limited to prevent damage to adjacent buildings and other infrastructure. In particular it is proposed to quantify the relative effects of small strain non-linearity of soils, non-linear stiffness of walls and shrinkage of floor slabs used in top-down construction on the deformations associated with excavations. This research will include laboratory experiments on block samples cut from excavations in Chicago and Boston to characterize the constitutive behavior of the soils with emphasis on the small strain responses, detailed field experiments at deep excavations where ground deformation and structural responses of the support system are measured and related to the construction activities at the site, and finite element simulations and after-the-fact adaptive management evaluations using inverse analysis based on observed field observations."

Cooperating school districts include: Cinncinnatus Central School District, The Cortland City School District, Dryden Central School District, Homer Central School District, Marathon Central School District, and South Seneca Central School District, and the New York City Department of Education. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the project resides in the rigorous course of study required of the Scholars; one that involves a course of study akin to a major in a specific STEM discipline and that includes strong preparation in and experience with teaching in inner city and other needy schools. To prepare them to work in these high needs schools the Noyce Scholars are being enrolled in a comprehensive program in urban education and are being offered specialized course work and field experiences in these schools. During at least the first two years of their teaching career (early induction years) they will receive specialized mentoring through both electronic and in-person means. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In addition to the positive effect the Scholars will have on the schools and students with whom they interact, the project is designed to help the teachers it prepares become leaders in STEM education. In addition to their scholarships the Scholars are receiving funds to cover membership in appropriate professional societies and to attend regional and national meetings of these societies so they become members of and contribute to the national STEM education community. The project is also preparing to create a Robert Noyce Facebook group to enable Noyce Scholars from across the whole community of Robert Noyce Scholarship projects post materials and ideas and exchange information on meeting common challenges."

The title of the 2009 School will be: ""High-pressure Crystallography: From Novel Experimental Approaches to Applications in Cutting-Edge Technologies"".The topics covered at the 2009 school will be of great importance to the new generation of geophysics and mineral physics scientists. New, groundbreaking experimental techniques, as well as advanced computational approaches used to study structure, properties and transformations of minerals in Earth and planetary interiors, as well as the theoretical background necessary to understand these phenomena will be covered. Additional multidisciplinary topics such as synthetic chemistry aspects, or behavior of biomolecules and microorganisms at high pressure will create a unique blend of subjects that will equip the participants with a very broad overview and understanding of high-pressure science.Erice Schools have a program of about 10 days of intensive training and interaction, and are attended by approximately 30 lecturers and 100 students. All lecturers are very accomplished scientists with international reputation. The school has a unique format, truly focused on education, which emphasizes direct hands-on exercises and stimulates active interaction between the instructors and the students in a fashion similar to the Gordon Research Conferences.Another very important and unique feature of the Erice schools is the availability of the whole course though web broadcasting system, which has been successfully conducted since 2003,and extended the access to the course lectures and materials to a much broader, international student body. As determined by the organizers of previous schools, at peak hours, as many as seven hundred scientists around the world were remotely participating in the Erice lectures.It is also worth noting that the remote participation allows interaction with the lecturers via chat-room service.The general policy for producing course teaching materials consists of requesting each invited lecturer to write a 5-10 page summary of his/her contribution, including a comprehensive list of references. The collected lecture notes are distributed to participants on their arrival. The lecture notes are published in a mongraph book form by international printing companies. The funds requested in this proposal are to cover partial cost of accommodation and subsistence of eight young participants from US institutions ($1000 per student). Supplemental support has been provided by COnsortium for Materials Research in Earth Sciences (COMPRES)."

They produce many distinct chemical compounds, and these compounds are different between different species. Even more variation occurs when plant species hybridize and duplicate their genomes. The effects of hybridization and genome duplication (polyploidy) on plant chemistry will be explored in Calendula, a small group of Mediterranean plants rich in chemical diversity, with polyploid species presumably created by hybridization. The project will use DNA sequences to determine how the species are related to each other, and will survey chemical diversity using liquid and gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The genes that encode the enzymes that make the various chemicals will be investigated by examining when and where they are expressed, and sequencing their transcripts. Understanding processes that create genetic and phenotypic novelty and drive divergence of species is fundamental to understanding biodiversity at all levels.<br/><br/> This project brings together the disciplines of systematics, molecular biology, ecology, and biochemistry, and facilitates international collaboration and exchange. It will increase understanding of plant diversification in the Mediterranean and may inform treatments of the genus in Mediterranean floras. All data and results will be disseminated widely via databases such as GenBank, TreeBASE, and NAPRALERT, and specimens collected in the field will be deposited at Cornell and at collaborating institutions abroad. Insights gained during the execution of this project will enrich mentorship provided through the PlantingScience program, which connects middle and high school students with working plant scientists."

The proposed research investigates pollen dispersal patterns for a ""buzz-pollinated"" tree species. Buzz-pollination occurs when bees grasp a flower and vibrate pollen free of specialized pores. Because this mechanism excludes pollen dispersal by exotic honeybees, tracking pollen movement will yield a uniquely powerful indicator of native bee movement. Native faunal biodiversity and plant gene flow patterns will be examined in undisturbed habitats and in highly fragmented shade coffee plantation habitats and will provide mechanistic insight into the capacity of shade coffee farms to serve as biodiversity refuges and habitat corridors. <br/><br/>As agricultural areas continue to expand, it is critical that the impacts of land management on pollinator communities and pollen dispersal processes are understood. By focusing on international collaboration, this research strengthens understanding between scientists, students, and managers in the United States and Mexico in order to build local and international leadership in the study of tropical forests and sustainable agroecosystems. Thus far, this research has provided the opportunity to communicate with coffee farmers about land management, pollination services and erosion control within their farms. As deforestation continues, it is essential to understand how to maintain key ecological processes required by tropical plant and pollinator communities."

The proposed work will lead to an enhanced understanding of both structure property relationships in low and negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials, and strategies for controlling thermal expansion. The pressure dependence of thermal expansion (TE) in a variety of low and negative TE materials will be examined to establish the factors that lead to highly pressure dependent coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) in such materials. It is hypothesized that low pressure phase transitions in NTE materials will lead to the quite widespread occurrence of extreme pressure sensitivity. The pressure dependence of CTEs is a design consideration for composites where a NTE filler may experience stresses. The control of thermal expansion, by modifying the O:F ratio, in oxyfluorides with a ReO3 framework structure, will be examined and the underlying structure property relationships established by separately interrogating the response of M-F-M and M-O-M links to temperature and pressure using total scattering methods. Substitution of fluoride for oxide, as a means of controlling thermal expansion, is an unexplored arena with great potential for interesting findings. The local structures of AX2O7 (A - Zr, Hf; X - P, V) will be examined using total scattering to better understand their high temperature phase transitions and how the nanostructure (local structure) of their disordered high temperature phases can lead to low or negative thermal expansion, as only the disordered forms of these materials display interesting expansion characteristics<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>The thermal expansion characteristics of a material play a very important role in determining if it is suitable for use in a wide variety of applications. The proposed work will lead to an enhanced understanding of strategies for controlling thermal expansion, and the preparation of new materials. This will be of value in the search for new useful engineering materials. As an integral part of this work, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in a wide variety of synthetic and materials characterization techniques, introduced to important concepts in materials chemistry/science, and engaged in activities that develop professional skills. These skills are of considerable value to the US economy. A significant component of the proposed experimental work will be conducted using major x-ray and neutron scattering facilities located at Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories. The work at DOE laboratories enhances the educational experience of students, and leads to collaborations that professionally benefit both university and government laboratory employees."

Fluid flow through black smoker vents plays a significant role in the exchange of heat and chemicals between the oceanic crust and the ocean. This flow delivers energy to a diverse subseafloor ecosystem and serves to link tectonic and magmatic processes to chemical and biological processes. Measurements of fluid flow in these systems are essential for measuring fluxes and understanding complex systematic linkages. Despite the importance of measuring fluid flow rates, there is currently no instrument capable of obtaining long term flow measurements in black smoker vents. High temperatures, low pH, and mineral precipitation make invasive techniques infeasible. To address this problem, The PI proposes to develop a non-invasive image-based instrument to obtain flow rates in black smoker vents. This camera system will employ a new technique for measuring black smoker flow, called Optical Plume Velocimetry (OPV), which has been developed in the laboratory and has been shown to work well on simulated black smoker flows. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>This study will develop an instrument that will increase our ability to understand the hydrology of marine hydrothermal systems and a variety of related processes, including the interactions between geomechanical processes and other processes such as heat and chemical transport and biological productivity. The development and field test of this technology will open up a wide range of possible experiments at many vent fields on the mid-ocean ridge. This work will also support the work of a young scientist. Crone has a strong record of public outreach through the media, and communicating his results to scientific and general audiences."

By examining patterns of gene expression within the well-characterized network of genes underlying the development of the larval skeleton in these two species, and in the hybrid offspring between these species, the investigators will identify specific genetic interactions within the network that have evolved between the species.

Some of these species rely on environmental sex determination, such as visual or population cues, or temperature of egg incubation. In contrast, most mammals use a genetic sex-determining system that depends on the Y chromosome-linked gene Sry. Despite this species diversity, many of the same genetic pathways for male and female formation are involved. However, the mechanisms of testis and ovary formation are proving to be highly diverged, providing exciting insights into the evolution of male and female pathways. As it is nearly impossible to keep up with the advances made in so many diverse animal systems, the objective of this meeting is to exchange information, using a comparative approach between vertebrate species to advance our understanding of the process of sex determination for the formation of males and females. This meeting emphasizes the participation of junior scientists, including assistant professors, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students, an essential aspect of their scientific training. Indeed, at the last meeting in 2006, ~80% of the participants who gave talks or presented posters were junior scientists. In addition, ~35% of the invited speakers at the current meeting are women. Thus, the incorporation of significant numbers of junior scientists and women into this meeting will continue. Another important objective will be to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities. Knowledge of sex-determining mechanisms in diverse vertebrate species provides important insights into how nature balances sex ratios in animal populations."

The system will also allow for field biologists to ask questions about the temporal and spatial dynamics of acoustic communication. Many species produce sounds, and by identifying and localizing them, we can census biodiversity and study the natural dynamics of communication. Typically, these will be vocal sounds, such as bird song, or mammal or frog calls, but in theory, the equipment and algorithms can be used for other sorts of sounds (such as the stridulations of cricket wings). To do so, we must build robust hardware and easy to use software that field biologists can and will use. While there has been the development of ?proof-of-concept? tools and algorithms for many of the components of a usable system, there is no reliable, robust, and easy-to-use system that will permit field biologists to easily census acoustic animals. To do so, a platform called VoxNet will be developed. VoxNet is an integrated software and hardware package which will be a quantum leap forward beyond existing technology in for main areas: software, near-real time event recognition, energy efficiency, and a much longer communication range. <br/><br/>VoxNet will be a new, highly integrated, deployable acoustic sensor node with a lower unit cost, and lower energy cost than any existing system. VoxNet will include a highly optimized system software and driver to reduce energy costs through duty cycling. In addition, new 2D/3D algorithms to localize the source of the sound will be developed. These new algorithms will run in near-real-time on a distributed network of VoxNet nodes, enabling users to detect and identify vocalizing animals while in the field. A powerful and easy-to-use software environment based on the WaveScope programming model and the XStream distributed stream processing system (technology partially developed under NSF support at MIT) will be developed. Finally, the system will be tested in the field to both census birds and identify individually alarm calling marmots. <br/><br/>The development of tools for field biologists to use will create new ways to census biodiversity, and ask here-to-for impossible or difficult-to-ask questions about the spatial and temporal dynamics of vocal displays. When deployed, we expect these tools to generate novel and important discoveries. The dissemination of these tools will enhance research productivity in behavior, ecology and evolutionary biology. And, these tools will create novel ways to census, conserve, and manage biodiversity. The process of developing these tools will create integrative educational opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students."

This research will investigate how land use influences nutrient removal by the thin mats of algae and microbes that cover most substrates in streams (biofilms). Understanding how changes in biofilm composition can affect nutrient removal is essential as land use change continues to increase worldwide. Studies have often focused on the consequences of altering availability of a single resource such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), or carbon. Many changes in land use result in changes in the availability of more than one resource, thus, there is a need to better understand the potential interactions of simultaneously varying multiple resources on biofilm community composition. Experiments supported by this award will quantify the changes that occur in the composition and function of stream biofilm in response to varied resource gradients by manipulating N+P and carbon concentrations in experimental chambers. <br/><br/>As landscapes are increasingly impacted by agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, understanding the response of stream ecosystems to nutrient loading will help predict nutrient retention and export capacity of surface waters. This research will identify how biofilm community interactions alter nutrient cycling and inform land managers of potential consequences of changes in land use."

First part deals with<br/>small cancellation theory over relatively hyperbolic groups.<br/>Namely we intend to use methods elaborated by the PI to construct<br/>new groups with 'exotic' properties that solve some long--standing<br/>problems in the classical theory of groups. The second part is<br/>motivated by the Virtual Haken Conjecture and is based on a<br/>generalization of Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn surgery theory in the<br/>context of relatively hyperbolic groups.

Values of operator functions do not commute in general, which makes the analysis of such functions and, in particular, their approximations much subtler than in the classical case. Under certain assumptions, traces of the remainders of the first and second order approximations can be represented via spectral shift functions, which originate from Lifshits' work on the quantum theory of crystals in 1952. While higher order Taylor-type approximations are also of interest in applications (for instance, in perturbation theory for Schrodinger operators with long-range potentials), very little is known about the structure of their error terms. The project will concentrate on the study of the higher order Taylor-type approximations, in particular, on testing Koplienko's conjecture of 1984 on existence of higher order spectral shift measures.<br/><br/>Perturbation theory has originated as mathematical modeling of some problems of quantum mechanics, where physical quantities are described by self-adjoint operators acting on a separable Hilbert space. The change of a value of an operator function under a perturbation of its argument is reflected in the spectral shift functions. A comprehensive theory with various applications, including those to perturbation theory for Schrodinger operators, scattering theory, and spectral flow, has been constructed for these functions. Finding higher order analogs of the spectral shift functions is one of the goals of the project. Many operators can be naturally affiliated with von Neumann algebras (for instance, the integrated density of states for some operators can be expressed in terms of the corresponding von Neumann algebras). We will work in both the original and the von Neumann algebra setting of the perturbation theory."

A two-day workshop entitled ""The International Workshop on Rapid Release of Pre-publication Data"", organized by Genome Canada in partnership with the National Institutes of Health-National Human Genome Research Institute (NIH-NHGRI), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the UK Wellcome Trust, will be held May 12 - 13, 2009 at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel in Toronto (Canada). This workshop will bring together 150 research scientists, generators of large-scale data sets from human, plant and microbiome sources, database curators, funders and journal editors from around the world to review the history, successes and challenges of rapid, prepublication data release, to revisit the definition of a ""community resource project"" and to discuss how to ensure that data of different types produced by community resource projects continue to be made available rapidly and in a manner that makes them maximally useful for scientific research. Funds from the NSF will support 10 US scientists to participate in this workshop. It is anticipated that the outcomes of the workshop will be developed into a set of international guidelines for pre-publication release for the major types of large-scale, genome-wide data sets being produced from international human, microbiome, and plant community resource projects. A perspective paper to publicize the workshop recommendations and guidelines will be submitted for publication."

The first class of cycles represent abelian surfaces having complex multiplication by a fixed order in a quartic CM field. The second class of cycles are the Hirzebruch-Zagier cycles which represent abelian surfaces having quaternionic multiplication by a fixed order in an indefinite quaternion algebra over the rationals. The cycles of complex multiplication points lie in codimension two, while the Hirzebruch-Zagier cycles lie in codimension one. Hilbert modular surfaces are known to admit integral models which are regular of dimension three, hence one can compute the intersection multiplicity of a codimension two cycle of complex multiplication points with a codimension one Hirzebruch-Zagier cycle. The principal investigator will prove that if the codimension two cycle is held fixed while the Hirzebruch-Zagier cycle varies, then the resulting intersection multiplicities are the Fourier coefficients of a particular weight two modular form. Of particular interest is the case in which the two cycles intersect improperly. This modular form is defined by restricting a parallel weight one Hilbert modular Eisenstein series on a totally real field, viewed as a function on the product of two upper half planes, to the diagonally embedded upper half plane.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Elliptic curves and their higher dimensional variants, called abelian varieties, play an increasingly important role in modern cryptology, and the construction of secure encryption algorithms can sometimes be reduced to the problem of constructing abelian varieties with prescribed properties. The principal investigator will count the number of abelian varieties of dimension two (abelian surfaces) which possess a prescribed collection of symmetries. As the precise collection of symmetries is allowed to vary, the resulting counting formulae are expected to agree with a known sequence of numbers appearing in the theory of modular forms. This latter sequence is readily computable, and thus the resulting formulae will provide an effective method to count the number of abelian surfaces with prescribed properties."

This spreading is seldom Gaussian, having much fatter (power-law) tails, and cannot be predicted using conventional partial differential equations. We build on an existing procedure that utilized prior calculations of the distribution of particle velocities and path lengths to predict the distribution of solute arrival times neglecting molecular diffusion. The calculations were based on a fusion of percolation theoretical techniques: cluster statistics of percolation theory, critical path analysis, and path tortuosity. Each flow path is defined through the smallest (rate-limiting) conductance on that path. The long-time tail in the distribution of arrival times relates to those tortuous paths of particle transport near the percolation threshold. When diffusion is included, however, particles cannot stay on these paths for such long times and power law behavior grades into Gaussian behavior at long distances (as is already known to occur for an individual capillary). Effects of diffusion relative to flow are estimated using a quantity called the Peclet number, Pe. We find that Gaussian behavior sets on at a distance which is proportional to a power of Pe. Our proposed research includes: 1) Generating the probability, fi, that a particle diffuses off a flow path at pore i, 2) Using fi to generate the probability that a particle stays on a particular flow path to an arbitrary length and incorporate into existing code, 3) Relating the resulting distribution of arrival times, W(t), at arbitrary spatial position, x, to a spatial solute distribution, W(x) at arbitrary time, t, 4) Calculating the moments of the spatial solute distribution. Understanding spatio-temporal evolution of the concentrations of solutes is important in monitoring subsurface spills, evaluating groundwater age distributions, guiding plant uptake of minerals and fertilizers, and design of enhanced oil-recovery processes. Thus this research can enhance understanding of processes relevant to agriculture, oil and mining industries, toxic waste clean up and risk assessment, geological sequencing, and groundwater age and source estimation. The second potential impact of our work is that it could lead to a change in perspective of the people in this field of research, with renewed emphasis on techniques other than those of continuum mechanics and the associated differential equations."

The main force acting on these large scales is the mutual gravitational pull of the stars and the dark matter. Galaxies are believed to form by the merger of many smaller units; during this time, gravitational forces vary wildly. Galaxies seen early in cosmic history often have very large bars; the group will explore how these large bars could be produced in this early violent phase. They will then examine how, in the quieter later life of the galaxy, such large bars could shrink to become the shorter and faster-rotating bars seen today. They will also investigate how the disk of stars could become warped and thickened, and how the central bulge might be built up, slowly over cosmic history. In this investigation they will use a combination of perturbation theory, direct integration of stellar orbits, and N-body simulations of several types. To study how gas in the disk affects the galaxy's development, they will combine their N-body code with a code to follow gas dynamics, and will implement a multiple time step algorithm that should increase the simulation throughput by 30 times. The result will be detailed predictions for the motions of stars and gas in present-day galaxies.<br/><br/>This award will support a graduate student, and the group will offer research projects to undergraduates, including those in their institution's computer animation group. These students will be trained in numerical and visualization techniques. The group will distribute test suites and tools for their simulation codes, together with reference solutions, to enable other researchers in the field to compare the detailed results of their own codes on the same test problems. They will also produce visualizations and other outreach material from their computations."

Today, between 40 million and 56 million people in the United States report some type of disability, and this number will likely grow in the coming years as the baby boom generation enters late life. RESNA is the one organization with an international focus that is devoted solely to technology for individuals with disabilities. Comprised of over 1,000 individual and institutional members (researchers, clinicians, manufacturers, suppliers, professionals and end-users of technology devices and equipment), the organization has as its purpose to improve the health and participation of people with disabilities in mainstream society. To this end, RESNA supports individuals engaged in research, development, education, advocacy and the provision of technology through a number of programs and activities, which in addition to the annual conference include a credentialing program for assistive technology practitioners, suppliers and rehabilitation engineering technologists, as well as sponsored projects. RESNA's Technical Standards Board is the U.S. Technical Advisory Group to ANSI, the official U.S. representative to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), for the development of ISO standards pertaining to assistive technology and other products for persons with disabilities.<br/><br/>The RESNA Student Design Competition fosters innovation and creativity with the ultimate goal of producing technology that can contribute to the independence of individuals with disabilities. The first SDC was held in 1980 as part of the inaugural RESNA conference. Since then, over 200 designs have been identified as winning entries, chosen from more than 600 submissions by students from over 115 different universities. SDC entries are required to represent the work of students ONLY, including the design documentation; both undergraduates and graduates are eligible to take part. Many past participants in the event are now leaders in service, research, and educational areas related to technology for people with disabilities. Some past student designs have been patented and are now available commercially. NSF has been a supporter since 2005. This year's funding will enable the SDC to be further expanded and enhanced, so as to include more entries and support for more design teams, especially from minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities. A call for participation has been posted on the conference website, and also distributed electronically to a large number of colleges and universities with engineering and design schools. A team of 5 judges will pre-select entries from up to 10 teams, from which two members each will be invited to attend the conference supported with travel and hotel funds as well as complimentary registration. During a half-day session in which the teams will make presentations before the judges and public audience at the conference, 5 teams will ultimately be selected as the final winners. Judges will have an opportunity to ask questions and make suggestions and recommendations to the design teams. A platform session will be held this year for the second time as part of the SDC, in which the 5 finalists will make presentations to the general conference attendees. All SDC teams invited to the conference will have an opportunity to present their projects in a poster session during the general conference time. More information is available online at http://www.resna.org/conference/index.php.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The annual RESNA Conference and the Student Design Competition combine to create a forum for interaction between working and experienced rehabilitation engineers and students who are about to enter the field. Unique in its primary focus on undergraduates, the event will provide participants with experience and skills that assist them to be successful in their engineering and design careers, and will further encourage, support and mentor students in various disciplines to become involved in the assistive technology and rehabilitation engineering fields. In an effort to help communicate and disseminate information about this important opportunity to impact the lives of individuals with disabilities, and to increase participant diversity even further both with respect to individuals and universities, NSF funding will be used in part this year for the second time to provide video and audio streaming of the SDC activities that can then be made into podcasts or videos for the RESNA website."

Contributing to the achievement of this goal are: 1) recruitment of highly qualified STEM undergraduates into science teaching careers; 2) preparation to teach science that is aligned with national standards; and 3) support for science teachers during the new teachers' induction years. The recruitment strategies include informal science internships for ten freshmen and sophomore students during the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012. During the project's third through fifth years a total of fifty $11,000 annual scholarships will be awarded to thirty juniors and seniors enrolled in the dual science and education degree program. Scholarship recipients are obligated to teach science for two years in a high need school district (preferably in Missouri) for each year they received a scholarship. This obligation must be completed within eight years of graduation. Partner school districts include Hannibal School District No. 60, Mexico Missouri Public Schools, Moberly School District, and the Saint Louis Public Schools. Noyce Scholars while serving as student teachers and as new teachers participate in the Noyce Scholar Support Network (NSSN), an on-line collaboration and learning environment where past, current, and future Noyce Scholars, along with Missouri University science educators and scientists, form a community of learners. Instrumental to increasing teacher retention is a cadre of mentor teachers in the partner schools, and support for Noyce Scholars to participate in state and regional science teacher conferences."

In addition, modeling of the vibrational dynamics of supported clusters will be conducted by molecular dynamics simulations through an international collaboration (Canada). The intellectual merit of this work is based on the improvement of the current understanding on: (i) the formation, the structural and thermal stability of bimetallic alloys in isolated nanoclusters, (ii) their intrinsic electronic and vibrational properties, (iii) how these characteristics change due to cluster size-effects, cluster-support interactions, the presence of ligands on the cluster surface, and the composition of the nanoalloys, and (iv) whether phonon-induced structural phase transitions (known in ferromagnetic bulk Invar alloys) persist and can be tuned in nanoclusters. Since the electron and phonon density of states are key elements in understanding and predicting important materials properties, this project will advance the present knowledge of basic physical phenomena underlying electrical and thermal conductivity, heat capacity, vibrational entropy, electron-phonon coupling, and 1/f noise in electronic devices. In addition, insight will be obtained on whether phonon-assisted surface chemical reactions could play an important role in the comprehension of the catalytic properties of metal nanoclusters. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Metal nanoclusters exhibit intriguing electronic and atomic vibrational phenomena that deviate dramatically from the corresponding bulk properties. Metal nanoclusters are used in optics (nanophotonics), magnetism (recording media), medicine (targeted drug delivery), and in chemistry (catalytic materials). Many questions remain on the detailed nature of their electronic and vibrational properties, and a more thorough physical understanding is needed to advance the science and technology of these materials. This project will improve the present knowledge on the formation, the structural and thermal stability of bimetallic alloys in nanoclusters, and the parameters that can be used to tune their intrinsic physical properties such as cluster size, support and composition. A deeper insight into important material properties including electrical and thermal conductivity will be obtained. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and given the opportunity to conduct state-of-the-art research, not just at the University of Central Florida, but also at national and international user facilities, including the Advanced Photon Source (Chicago) and Spring8 (Japan). K-12 students teamed up with undergraduates will be in charge of the sample preparation. A website entitled ?Why?s of Science? will be setup to disseminate science-related educational activities among primary and middle school students. In order to stimulate the access of minority (Hispanic) parents to science, the website will be available in English and Spanish."

The research will employ a new technique, called Coherent Integration, developed by the author.  This technique has been tested on the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer but can be used on other instruments.  <br/><br/>Accurate measurements of stellar diameters and other parameters provide fundamental tests of the theory of stellar evolution.  Until recently, the only good calibrating star was the Sun, but now the Dr. Jorgensen and other groups are assembling data on stars of different masses, ages, and compositions.  These data will allow improved understanding of the interiors and evolution of stars of many types, and will uncover differences between the evolution of single and binary stars.  Early tests show that the method yields diameter measurements to an accuracy of 0.2%, a significant improvement over previous work.<br/><br/>This project will make unique measurements of several aspects of stellar properties, and is naturally divided into self-contained projects for student and classroom involvement.

0936065	RAPID: The Impact of Rural and Urban Flooding on Water and Soil Quality in the Red River Valley of the North	EAR	HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES	05/15/2009	05/20/2009	Thomas DeSutter	ND	North Dakota State University Fargo	Standard Grant	Thomas Torgersen	04/30/2011	"$59,694.00"	Francis Casey	thomas.desutter@ndsu.edu	Dept 4000 - PO Box 6050	FARGO	ND	581086050	7012318045	GEO	1579	"9150, OTHR, 0000"	$0.00	"Surface flow off agricultural and urban areas contains elevated concentrations of inorganic and organic chemicals compared to subsurface soil waters. Due to weather conditions during the fall of 2008, record snowfall in December of 2008, and a recent blizzard event (March 2009), the National Weather Service is predicting that the water level of the Red River of the North (RR) in the cities of Fargo, ND and Moorhead, MN may reach 12.5 m above the river bottom, which would surpass the current record of 12.2 m set on 7 April 1897. The major flood level for Fargo is 9.1 m. Therefore, the purpose of this RAPID proposal is to quantify the effects of agricultural and urban runoff on water and soil quality upstream and downstream of a major urban area of North Dakota (Cities of Fargo) and Minnesota (City of Moorhead), which are located along the banks of the Red River of the North. The urgency for this grant is due to the fact that the RR water levels have only just started to increase in depth and the predicted maximum flood stage will be reached in late March, 2009. This event is being classified as a 500 yr flood with the predicted hydrograph showing flooding for only 20 to 30 d. This research will test two hypotheses: 1) that flooding-water quality will be impacted by the movement of this water through a large, urban environment; and 2) that post-flooding sediment deposited onto riparian and urban landscapes will have elevated chemical concentrations compared to the underlying soil. Hypothesis 1 will be evaluated by taking water samples upstream and downstream of the major population centers of Fargo-Moorhead and samples will be analyzed for 17â-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1), total Hg, total gasoline hydrocarbons, total diesel hydrocarbons, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, pH, electrical conductivity, sulfate, chloride, and total suspended solids. Hypothesis 2 will be evaluated by sampling three low lying areas that were flooded for more than 14 d, which will include a natural riparian area, a community garden or a public park, and an urban lawn. Deposited mass sediment will be determined and the sediment and underlying soil will be quantified for 17â-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1), total Hg, total gasoline hydrocarbons, total diesel hydrocarbons, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, pH, electrical conductivity, sulfate, and chloride.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed research includes an expansion of the knowledge of how flooding-waters from and through both rural landscapes and urban centers influence both water and sediment quality. This work will increase our understanding of how flooding-water quality is impacted as it travels through an urban center of the northern Great Plains and also how the deposited sediment impacts soil quality. Many of the low lying areas within Fargo-Moorhead are used for parks, community gardens, and lawns and providing information about the quality of the post-flood sediment is important to scientific and public communities. <br/><br/>Floods are naturally occurring, but the origin of the flooding waters can influence water quality and the quality of soil in low lying areas. The broader impacts of the proposed research include a better understanding of the impact that major floods have on large, urban communities with respect to water quality and the quality of the deposited sediment. Training of a graduate student and disseminating the findings of this research to both public and scientific communities via presentations and published articles will be a primary focus of this research. Local and state officials will be particularly interested in the findings of this work."

The PI also proposes to study an analog automorphic forms for affine Kac-Moody groups as well as some structures generalizing the so-called geometric Langlands correspondence for finite-dimensional reductive groups.<br/><br/>The proposed research lies on the border of such fields as number theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics; successful implementation of the project might shed some new light on the connections between these fields. For example, number theory is perhaps one of the oldest mathematical subjects and one of its most important parts is called the Langlands program. Recently it has been realized that geometric aspects of the Langlands program have many connections with algebraic geometry as well as modern mathematical physics (such as 4-dimensional quantum field theory). The proposed research project should confirm the existence of such links as well broaden and generalize them."

The main common feature of all these problems resides in their multilinear nature. Of particular interest when dealing with a multilinear operator acting on some product of Lebesgue spaces is to understand the range of indices for which it is well behaved. In this proposal the focus is mainly on almost everywhere convergence, and thus inherently on the boundedness of the associated maximal operators. A famous unresolved problem regards pointwise convergence for the bilinear ergodic averages associated with commuting transformations. The analysis of this question revealed deep connections with a two dimensional version of the bilinear Hilbert transform and with Carleson's theorem on the pointwise convergence of Fourier series. Another interesting circle of questions arises in the analysis of bilinear polynomial averages. Recent progress from arithmetic combinatorics, combined with multi-scale time-frequency techniques is likely to shed light on all these issues.<br/><br/>This proposed research is at the cutting edge of what is now being done in dynamical systems, harmonic analysis and arithmetic combinatorics. It is expected that the resolution of the questions advanced in this proposal will further the mathematical community's understanding of the connections between these areas, in particular between processes in harmonic analysis and their analogues in ergodic theory. The nature of this research makes it also likely for our investigation to shed yet more light on some of the tools that are used in other areas of science, such as signal processing. The research project that is proposed in this grant will lead to interactions between the PI and mathematicians from other universities with whom part of the investigation might be conducted."

Species can be vines, shrubs, or small trees, and grow in diverse habitats, from beaches to alpine woodlands. Evolutionary relationships of buckwheats are poorly known, leading to confusing classification of these plants. This confusion hinders understanding of how traits have evolved. The researchers will use DNA sequence data to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships in the buckwheats, improve the classification, and better understand how the group evolved. This last goal involves linking the diverse morphologies to the evolutionary history and habitats of various species of buckwheats. Computer-based geographic information systems help correlate precise habitat conditions and species distributions with vegetative traits in order to identify morphological traits of the plants that may have evolved in response to particular habitats.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the project include additional training for the co-PI (a female graduate student), national and international scientific collaborations, training opportunities for undergraduate students and the general public, and dissemination of the scientific findings. The co-PI is being trained in plant systematics (the study of plant diversity), including field and laboratory techniques and analytical methods, and collaborates with other scientists in California for advice and plant samples. Training will include undergraduates as field assistants and will involve the general public through a hands-on workshop on the identification of buckwheats. Data collected in the study will be deposited in online databases for access by other researchers. Findings of the study will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, and made available online at web sites such as the Tree of Life (www.tolweb.org).

The approach takes advantages of multi-photon process induced by ultrashort laser pulses to initialize a universal photosensitivity response to change refractive indices in a wide array of optical materials. Bulk heating effects from high-repetition laser pulses will be utilized to mitigate laser-induced material damages to minimize optical loss and to achieve desired device performance of lightwave circuits. To fabricate 3D periodic photonic structures, multi-layer near-field diffractive optical elements will be developed to produce 3D interference patterns. Periodic photonic structures such as diamond-like photonic crystals will be fabricated using this one-optical-element and one-laser-exposure holographic fabrication process. <br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will yield a cross-platform laser manufacturing technique to fabricate high-quality lightwave circuits in a wide array of optical substrates. The fabrication technique will enable new 3D photonic circuit architectures that allows lightwave circuits to be routed vertically and continuously in- and out- of a plane. This will drastically increase the density, functionality, and complexity of the optical circuitry. The success of this research will also enable the fabrication of mid-IR fiber lasers and sensor devices for applications in chemical sensing and structural health monitoring in harsh environments. The holographic laser fabrication developed from this award can be conveniently built into the existing multiple mask fabrication flow for integrated optoelectronic circuit manufacturing. This enables the monolithic integration of photonic crystal structures with other on-chip optical components for widespread applications. This award will also support an interdisciplinary training program for undergraduate students on the integrated laser manufacturing and product innovation.

This four day event draws between 200?300 attendees across a broad set of interdisciplinary academic areas including mathematics (geometry, topology, numerical methods, optimization), engineering (design, modeling, simulation) and computer science (graphics, computational geometry). The meeting is a unique, multi-disciplinary event. Whereas most scientific meetings in the above areas are ?stove-piped? by the individual disciplines, the SIAM Activity Group on Geometric Design and the ACM Symposium on Solid and Physical Modeling have an over 30 year history of spanning disciplines. The above event is bringing together scientists and engineers, both from academia and industry, around the themes of geometry and topology and their role in product design, manufacturing, simulation and other applications.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies in the educational opportunities and the shared research objectives of the community. By providing travel grants for students studying in these areas, the NSF encourages the students to pursue interdisciplinary work and enhance their academic experiences. Secondarily, the academic subjects covered by this meeting are of vital importance in many areas of critical national need. Work presented at this meeting covers diverse topics ranging from biomedical CAD and biomanufacturing to sustainable design and optimization of next generation materials. The broader impact is found in developing the careers of the student supported by these travel grants and their work in these areas of critical national need. Given the central role geometry and topology play in everything from product design to virtual training systems to advanced manufacturing technology, the proper nurturing of these activities?especially those of an interdisciplinary nature?is vital to producing scientists and engineers who can meet the nation?s needs."

This study will address the interaction of plants with a widely available but rarely considered source of water and nutrients: fog. Fog is different from rain in that fog droplets must be intercepted from the air if they are to drip to the ground, where roots can take up the moisture. The amount of water collected thus depends on the shape of the vegetation present. By combining computer modeling with experimentation, this researcher will determine how plant shape can influence the amount of water collected, and use this information to simulate the effects of fog-water collection by vegetation in landscapes. In field experiments in Chile and Peru, artificial plant shapes will be established in a natural desert setting to create fog 'oases,' in which nearly all water for plant growth comes from fog. This funding will allow for monitoring of soil moisture below three types of shapes: natural plants; plants with modified shape; and artificial structures. These data will provide tests of theoretical predictions regarding relationships between plant shape and moisture collection. <br/><br/>A better understanding of the interactions between vegetation, fog, and water availability will inform biodiversity conservation efforts and watershed management in the face of climate change. This researcher engages in several international collaborations involving teaching at the undergraduate level and outreach to land-use managers."

Many wild species also colour the landscape of the U.S. In California, a group of mint species in the genus Lepechinia occur in the area known as the California Floristic Province, a region extending from Southern Oregon to Northern Baja. This project will use DNA sequences of Lepechinia and fossils to determine when the California Floristic Province originated. Additional DNA sequences will be used to determine how closely related Lepechinia is to other groups of mints. Finally, the DNA data will be used to assess how the morphology and breeding system of Lepechinia have changed during evolution. <br/><br/>The California Floristic Province has many plant species that occur nowhere else in the world. Because of its high diversity and unique set of species, there has been considerable interest in understanding how long it has been in existence and how it formed. Lepechinia and its close relative Salvia (a familiar garden plant) can help to determine the age of the flora. Preliminary results of this study show that the California clades of Lepechinia and Salvia originated between 10 and 20 million years ago, probably from ancestors that lived farther to the south."

This will develop an integrated high performance, low cost, and compact gas sensor device for environmental monitoring, with emphasis placed on the early and reliable detection of a variety of prevalent environmental and industrial airborne contaminants. The sensor system will be fast (i.e., having a response time <100 milliseconds) while demonstrating a minimum number of false positives. This detection requires sensors that are prevalent, sensitive, robust, and inexpensive. Furthermore, the response to targeted gases will be orthogonal to interfering species while also displaying fast recovery times. Many types of current gas sensors reveal large interfering sensitivities to molecules other than those of interest, typically resulting in false positive signals for the targeted gases. A micro-cantilever-based gas sensor technology that provides high sensitivity and low cross-sensitivity will be developed. The proposal will concentrate its efforts on detecting 5 gases of commercial and environmental importance: CO, NO2, H2S, NH3, and benzene. <br/><br/><br/>The ability to meet future environmental safety standards as outlined by the EPA will require gas sensors with high sensitivity (ppb level) and low cross-sensitivity.

One prominent legal and policy remedy for these disparities is school desegregation. It is unclear, however, to what extent inequalities stem from differences in school environments or from differences in family background and other extra-school attributes. In this research, the investigators exploit a random assignment of students to a desegregation program to answer the question, ""Given the same family background, what is the effect on minority students of attending a more integrated, higher-achieving school?"" The analysis uses data from a voluntary interdistrict desegregation plan that allows minority students to transfer from a largely minority and low-income district into neighboring, mostly white and upper middle-class districts. The project will use three sources of data to assess the outcomes of interest: 1) School district administrative records to assess academic outcomes; 2) Student and parent surveys to assess social outcomes; and 3) In-depth parent and student interviews to test the mechanisms that connect school context to student outcomes. Prior research has primarily focused on the effect of schools on academic outcomes; however, some of the most profound effects of school context are likely social--reflected in students' attitudes, friendships, level of civic engagement, and racial and ethnic identities. This mixed-method approach will provide an opportunity to explore the processes that drive the observed outcomes, something that has been lost on previous research.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research has implications for the educational opportunities for minority and low-income youth. Racial achievement gaps have proven to be stubborn, despite the sweeping changes in accountability procedures brought about by the No Child Left Behind legislation. There is very little good evidence on the ways in which desegregation in schools may alleviate achievement gaps or how it may socially prepare minority and low-income students for future participation in mainstream settings, such as diverse 4-year colleges or white-collar jobs. By broadly disseminating the findings from this study to academics, policy makers, and school practitioners, findings could potentially inform school assignment decisions."

The volcano being investigated is presently erupting unusual lavas of compositions indicative of the initial stages of arc formation. As such they have an unusual chemistry and are thought to be associated with hydrothermal fluids of exotic and extreme compositions. The likelihood that novel and previously undiscovered microbiological life forms associated with these fluids is a study target. Short lived radiogenic isotopes in lava samples from the volcanic vent will be measured to obtain an eruptive timeline. Coexisting hydrothermal fluids and erupted lava samples will be examined to elucidate the relationship between volatile and element partitioning between solid and fluid phases during this type of magmatism.

The Workshop will attempt a synthesis between physical relationships among the hottest matter (quark matter at more than 2 trillion degrees Kelvin) and the coldest matter (cooled atoms at a few billionth degree Kelvin) produced in the laboratory, new insights gained from superstring theory, which make it possible to infer the properties of certain strongly coupled thermal systems from the physics of black holes in five or more dimensions, and recent progress in the many-body theory of strongly coupled systems. The Workshop aims at advancing the knowledge of the physics of nearly perfect liquids. It has recently been recognized that the ability of fluids to flow frictionless is limited by fundamental quantum effects; but the precise form and the absolute nature of this limitation is a conjecture. All material substances known until recently were far away from the conjectured universal bound; only during the present decade has matter (quark matter and ultra-cold atoms) been discovered and studied that approaches it. It is not fully understood whether a common mechanism is at work in all instances or whether there are several distinct paths leading to perfect fluidity. While superstring theory has furnished a tractable theoretical model of such a fluid, it remains unclear how it relates to the two materials discovered in the laboratory. By bringing experts in the different areas together for an intense exchange of ideas, the Workshop will help to develop new ideas for answers to these wide-ranging questions at a forefront area in the physical sciences. It is hoped that the cross-disciplinary nature of the workshop may lead to scientific advances in all of the above fields of physics and counter the increasing compartmentalization found in many areas of the hard sciences."

Grottoli and Pease will investigate the underlying mechanisms influencing coral recovery and mortality during bleaching by studying carbon acquisition, allocation and utilization of the coral host. During bleaching, when corals loose their symbiotic algae and their supply of photosynthetically fixed carbon is dramatically reduced or lost, they must rely on other sources of energy such as stored lipids and carbohydrates, or heterotrophically acquired carbon to sustain their energetic demands. If (1) corals are better able to acquire carbon by increasing heterotrophic feeding, they may be more likely to survive bleaching and fully recover. Alternatively, if (2) corals are able to store larger amounts of excess energy reserves during non-bleaching periods (e.g., as lipids), they may be able to sustain themselves by utilizing these reserves until fully recovered. If (3) corals are more efficient at utilizing these stored energy reserves, they may be more likely to recover from bleaching. All three of these strategies are hypothesized mechanisms used by corals to promote recovery following bleaching. <br/><br/>In order to evaluate each mechanism, these investigators will perform a series of 13C-pulse labeling experiments designed to track the source of the fixed carbon, its allocation and storage within the host, and its utilization in bleached Montipora capitata and Porites compressa corals over the course of 14 months of recovery (relative to non-bleached controls). The experimental design allows for simultaneously measured variables to be comprehensively interpreted within the overall picture of the coral-algal symbiont-skeleton system relative to a control group. <br/><br/>The results of this research will contribute to a better understanding in fundamental biology of coral bleaching by experimentally evaluating the physiological and biogeochemical responses of corals to temperature-induced bleaching stressors both during bleaching and recovery.

This is funding to support the 4th international web service discovery and composition competition (the WS-Challenge), whose objective is to identify, evaluate and baseline approaches to solving that problem. Building on the success of the first three competitions, which were held in 2005 in Hong Kong, in 2006 in San Francisco, and in 2007 in Tokyo (the latter two with NSF funding), the PI will organize the planning and enactment of the 2008 competition to be held in conjunction with the IEEE International Conferences on Electronic Commerce (CEC 08) and on Enterprise Computing, E-Commerce and E-Services (EEE 08), which will take place in Washington DC in July. The first competition was limited to syntactical matching using the Web Services Description Language (WSDL); participants were required to identify and compose WSDL-specified services based on their input and output messages as specified in a directory of WSDL documents. In 2006 the competition focused additionally on the semantic linking of web services using XML-based semantic notations. The 2007 competition supported the implementation of an initial Web service interface package that served as a platform upon which participants built composition engines, which were then exposed as a Web service; teams were evaluated in terms of architecture and design as well as performance. The 2008 competition will focus on issues relating to dissemination, such as code generalization and creation of APIs that can be used to help new teams access the competition. NSF funding will support participation in the competition of approximately 4 teams from the United States consisting of about 2 students apiece. A small amount is earmarked for travel for the organizers to the competition and the conference registration of the PIs and research assistants.<br/><br/>The IEEE International Conferences on Electronic Commerce and on Enterprise Computing, E-Commerce and E-Services bring together researchers and developers from diverse areas of computing. The conferences provide a venue for developers and practitioners to explore and address challenging research issues surrounding e-technology, in order to develop a common research agenda and vision for e-commerce and e-business. The focus is two-fold: to investigate enabling technologies to facilitate next generation e-transformation; and to disseminate application and deployment experience in e-themes such as e-business, e-learning, e-government, e-finance, etc. The CEC/EEE conferences are particularly timely and relevant because they focus on the application of electronic services as they cut across several ""e-domains"", whereas other conferences tend to either focus on a specific technology or on a single domain.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The workshop and resulting artifacts will serve as a centralized repository of algorithms, software, and techniques in a timely emerging area. The workshop will provide participants with an opportunity to gain exposure in the community for their innovative work, and to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community. It will further help foster a sense of community among these young researchers, by allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. The workshop experience will integrate well with the goals of a software engineering education, as participants are evaluated on their design in addition to the performance of their approaches. To engage a broader audience in this year's event, the PI will expand his previously successful efforts to solicit teams from under-represented universities."

The objectives are to identify scientific goals that can be uniquely addressed on the continental margins of North America and discuss instrumentation needs for achieving these goals. The afternoon workshop focuses on EarthScope scientific targets in Alaska, in preparation for the arrival of USArray in Alaska. Among the objectives are to update and refine scientific goals of EarthScope in Alaska, seed new interdisciplinary collaborations and provide information to IRIS so that logistical and operational decisions for USArray deployment are informed by scientific needs. There is strong synergy between these two workshops as Alaska is one of the three regions targeted by the onshore/offshore group, and any discussion of scientific targets in the coastal regions of Alaska should consider how offshore data have the potential to contribute towards achieving scientific goals.

In recent years a near consensus has emerged among social scientists, legal scholars, and policymakers that secure property rights are essential for economic growth. Debate continues as to how institutions that protect property rights emerge, but many scholars argue that the existence of powerful societal actors with a stake in an effective legal framework is a key determinant of institutional development. Yet if secure property rights are vital for economic prosperity, why is the demand for the rule of law so weak in many societies? <br/><br/>The project builds on the argument that business elites' support for legal development depends on their strategies for protecting and acquiring assets. Specifically, it examines the link between these strategies and two related elements of societal demand for institutional development: (1) The extent to which business groups lobby for market-supporting laws, such as legislation for investor protection and effective arbitration procedural codes; and (2) The degree to which private sector actors rely on the legal system. <br/><br/>To address these issues, the project includes an original survey of Russian firm owners and managers. This survey complements the other components of the project, including qualitative fieldwork and formal modeling. The qualitative component consists of case studies of Russian legal reforms, semi-structured interviews with Russian business and political elites, and content analysis of business association and government documents. This qualitative research informs the assumptions and structure of the formal model, which analyzes the micro-level logic underlying firms' decisions to support or oppose reforms. <br/><br/>The project's findings will contribute to social scientists' and legal scholars' understanding of the politics of building legal institutions, offering insights into which actors are most likely to support legal reforms and which reforms are most likely to succeed. They will thereby contribute to policy debates about secure property rights, an issue that is of central interest to U.S. experts promoting growth in developing countries and to Russian policymakers seeking to diversify their economy."

The research project under development will address dynamical processes occurring in novel battery materials. The research aims to (i) extend battery models to include elastic stress, interfacial tension and diffusion, and slow electron transport; (ii) perform asymptotic and stability analyses and numerical simulations of the nonlinear waves; (iii) study wave-defect interactions, as a new mechanism for power loss; and (iv) simulate, analyze, and optimize transport in realistic cathode microstructures. <br/><br/>While significant effort has been invested in applied research over the past few decades, the performance of rechargeable batteries has improved only incrementally. Atomistic simulations have predicted new materials with higher energy density, but the physical limit has nearly been reached. However, power density (charge/discharge rate per unit mass) and cycle life must improve drastically for new applications such as electric vehicles. These properties are governed by dynamical processes occurring on larger length and time scales, better suited for continuum or statistical models, which have not been developed. Breakthrough advances towards the next generation of rechargeable batteries will require new fundamental understanding of such processes, and the field is ripe for contributions from applied mathematics. To meet this need, we plan a collaboration consisting of experts on atomistic simulations of batteries (Ceder), microstructural simulations (Thornton), and mathematical modeling of electrochemical systems (Golovin and Bazant). The team will build on a recently-formulated general continuum model for phase-transformation dynamics in battery materials and a new mode of intercalation by nonlinear waves."

Manufacturing processes are inherently imprecise, producing products that vary in geometry. The geometry variation detrimentally impacts not only the fitness of the final assembly, but also in many cases the functionalities of the final product. In this research, we will model and analyze the variation propagation in periodic structure from the manufactured part geometry to its dynamic response and then to provide guidelines on mitigating the undesirable dynamic response via controlling the mean and variation of part geometry. The proposed methodology includes variation propagation analysis in two directions: (i) In the forward prediction, the geometry variation of the manufactured products is characterized based on dense measurements, and then the probabilistic distributions of the dynamic responses are computed. (ii) In the backward analysis, using the abnormal dynamic response as input, a group of local geometric features that, upon modification, can mitigate the undesirable dynamic response are identified. <br/>If successful, this research will positively impact a variety of periodic structural products, including bladed-disks in aero-engines and power generation equipment, cutting tools in high speed machining, and space antenna, etc. Through the collaboration with General Electric, this research will directly benefit a host of industries such as aerospace, automotive and manufacturing industries where these periodic structures are used. Through its integrated research, education and outreach activities, this project will provide advanced knowledge in variation propagation and reduction for students from high schools to graduate schools and will enhance domestic students? interest in science and engineering and therefore strengthen our competitiveness in the global workforce."

Nationwide, roughly 1/3 of seats for state legislatures go uncontested, and in the vast majority of other races incumbents face weak opposition. Given the lack of candidacies, this project has important implications for political participation, competition, representation and accountability. The analysis focuses on Connecticut, which implemented public financing called ""Clean Elections"" for the 2008 elections. It exploits a unique opportunity to observe the effect of generous public subsidies by interviewing potential candidates before and after the onset of reform. A previous grant from the JEHT Foundation supported collection of pre-reform data during February-March of 2007. A post-reform survey of these same respondents provides data for a powerful panel study to observe the effect of reform on attitudes and behavior of potential candidates. <br/><br/>This research examines the underexplored question about how candidates emerge for state legislative office. Previous work has focused on congressional elections, demonstrating that most candidates come from the ranks of state legislatures. Since state legislatures appear to be the training ground for future national leadership, it is critical to understand obstacles that deter potential leaders from running for the statehouse. This study focuses especially on the role of public campaign subsidies in motivating citizens to run. Several states have, or are considering, public subsidy programs. But no study has assessed systematically whether public funding might increase the pool of candidates. Many candidates, particularly minorities and women, appear to lack personal and professional connections that might draw them into politics or boost their prospects of raising money. Although money is not the only obstacle for challengers, it looms large because of its high value for emerging candidates. Overall, this research sheds light on recruitment and participation patterns among political elites, the role of money and the dynamics of political competition in state elections. <br/><br/>The study has implications for public policy designed to stimulate civic participation and political competition. Running for office is a demanding form of political participation, but the health of American democracy depends on the willingness of some citizens to declare their candidacies to ensure electoral choice and competition. The dearth of candidates and lack of diversity have significant implications for political representation and accountability. By understanding factors that influence whether citizens choose to run, it becomes possible to design reforms that may expand the pool of candidates. If raising money looms large as an obstacle, then reforms such as Clean Elections or similar public funding programs hold promise to decrease barriers to entry for qualified citizens to run for office. Decreasing such barriers is especially important at the local level where citizens develop skills, interest and experience that might prepare them for higher levels of office. If, on the other hand, reforms such as Clean Elections do not increase the number and diversity of citizens who choose to run, then new policies need to be considered to achieve this goal. This study helps in identifying other factors, besides campaign money, that deter qualified citizens from running for office."

Long range forces between molecules are important because they determine macroscopic properties of matter; such as what phase (solid, liquid, gas, etc) is stable at a given temperature and the friction between sliding surfaces. Long range forces also determine the shape of large biologically important molecules such as proteins and DNA. This individual investigator award supports project designed to measure long range forces in some simple model systems using several complementary methods. One method is to expose a solid to a gas and then weigh the amount of adsorbed gas on the surface using a microbalance that can detect fractions of a single atomic layer. Atoms adsorbed on a surface can be considered to be two dimensional matter. They undergo phase transitions such as vaporization and freezing, which are very similar to the familiar three dimensional counterparts. When the adsorbed atoms are very light and weakly interacting (e.g. helium), quantum mechanical effects become important and the adsorbed 2D liquid can also become a superfluid, which means that it can flow forever without any driving force. Theory suggests that for helium-4 on substrates of alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium, etc) there are unusual competitions between the liquid-vapor transition and the superfluid-normal fluid transition. This competition will be investigated using both microbalances and reflection of polarized light. Another way to measure surface forces is to use an atomic force microscope (AFM). The forces are measured by monitoring the deflection of a micromachined silicon cantilever with a laser when the cantilever is brought near the surface. Making these measurements with a cantilever immersed in liquid helium is technically challenging, and is one of the goals of this project. Students and post doctoral associates involved with this project will have the opportunity to develop novel instruments, and receive training in a broad spectrum of techniques including cryogenics, high speed imaging, laser optics, and materials preparation. This training will enable them to become productive members of the research community, whether in academia, industrial or government laboratories.<br/><br/>****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****<br/>This award supports an individual investigator project with several aims in the general area of fluids, predominately quantum fluids. Wetting and its relationship to superfluid phase transitions when films of helium and helium mixtures are adsorbed on weak and intermediate strength alkali metal and metal oxide substrates will be studied and compared with theory. For another study, low temperature atomic force microscope (AFM) techniques will be developed. The AFM will be optimized to enable measurement of the distance dependence of Casimir forces due to both fluctuations in the electromagnetic field and fluctuations in the order parameter near the onset of superfluidity. Finally a smaller project will investigate the pinch-off phenomena in drops and bubbles to elucidate the connections between the phenomena in conventional viscous fluids and non-Newtonian fluids. The computer code developed for the pinch-off studies will be adapted to study the stability and breakup of multi-electron drops in Helium. Furthermore the motion of superfluid droplets on non-wetting surfaces will be studied. Students and post doctoral associates involved with this project will have the opportunity to develop novel instruments, and receive training in a broad spectrum of techniques including cryogenics, high speed imaging, laser optics, and materials preparation.

In sandy sediments, dense but ephemeral shell-hash patches provide bottom roughness that may affect the fluxes of larvae and food to the bed and provide recruits with shelter from predators. The objective of this RAPID project is to determine how the presence and persistence of ephemeral shell patches that alter the bottom roughness affect the recruitment, growth, and survival of surfclams. This rapid-response study capitalizes on a rare, high-density settlement and recruitment event of surfclams which occurred last year at the Long-term Ecosystem Observatory (LEO-15) in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. The investigators will survey the Beach Haven Ridge area of LEO-15 in the spring of 2009, using an autonomous underwater vehicle (REMUS) equipped with Side Scan Sonar to identify areas of shell accumulation, to chart their location and extent, and to measure turbulence above and outside the areas. Weekly core-sampling by divers and surfclam size measurements will be used to determine and compare surfclam survival and growth inside and outside of shell patches. Surveys and sampling will be repeated in the fall of 2009 to examine the persistence of the shell areas and to determine how these shell patches affect abundance and growth of 2008 and 2009 summer recruits.<br/><br/>This research will enhance knowledge of the ephemeral nature of shell aggregations, and their effects on surfclam settlement, mortality, and early growth. These results will contribute to understanding the morphodynamic and physical processes influencing surfclam population dynamics.<br/><br/>Results of this work will inform habitat-based management strategies and will aid in monitoring and management of an ecologically and commercially important shelf species. Undergraduate students will be involved in this work through the NSF-funded REU (Research Internships in Ocean Sciences) program.

It will take place in Cortona (Italy), at the Palazzone, a conference location belonging to the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa, between June 14 and 20, 2009, on the occasion of Corrado De Concini's 60th birthday. The speakers will be distinguished mathematicians working in the areas of Lie groups, representation theory and related fields with an emphasis on the interplay of algebraic and geometric methods in representation theory. The main topics of the conference are: finite and infinite dimensional Lie groups and Lie algebras, representation theory of Lie algebras and algebraic groups, invariant theory, symmetric and wonderful varieties and their compactifications, quantum groups and quantum affine algebras, hyperplane and subspace arrangements and their compactifications.<br/><br/>Representation theory is an area of mathematics that studies symmetry in linear spaces. It has important applications to quantum physics and chemistry. For instance, it allows one to incorporate the rotational symmetry of the space into the study of atoms, ultimately underlying the structure of the Periodic Table of chemical elements. Also, representation theory is one of the main tools in classifying elementary particles, and is a fundamental instrument of string theory, which aims to explain gravity quantum-mechanically. In addition, representation theory has applications to statistical physics, and to the theory of quantum computers. Recently, a great progress in representation theory was made thanks to applying deep ideas from geometry. In the other direction, representation theory may shed a new light on classical problems in geometry. The conference will highlight this interplay and will review some of the main achievements in this field."

The alternative pathway is being designed to incorporate components identified in the research literature as being critically important guiding criteria for successful teacher residency programs, including 1) direct pairing of the program with school system needs, 2) seamless flow between teacher preparation and induction into in-service teaching, 3) preparation for the challenges found in schools serving high poverty communities, 4) year-long residency as a part of the preparation, 5) mentoring provided by teacher leaders, and 5) access to community-based non-profit institutions that can reduce bureaucratic processes. Activities taking place during the planning process for submission of a full proposal to the Teaching Fellows/Master Teaching Fellows track, include 1) defining and refining the conceptual framework for the program, 2) determining the target number of recruits and developing marketing and recruitment plans, 3) developing program and curriculum components that incorporate the training and professional development content for mentor teachers, 4) identifying host school sites and mentor teachers where the residency apprenticeship classrooms will be located, 5) initiating professional development with mentor teachers, and 6) developing local partnerships with business and community groups to create necessary support structures for the Teacher Residents. The project team is also planning ways to document the efficacy of the initial Urban Teacher Residency programs in Hamilton and Knox County Schools, so that if the program model is effective, it can be disseminated as a resource for other programs seeking to implement alternative teacher preparation programs for mathematics and science educators who are capable of succeeding in hard-to-staff schools."

Domning (Howard University, Washington, DC)<br/>Lawrence G. Barnes (Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, CA)<br/><br/><br/>Abstract: PIs propose to collect fossils of seacows (Sirenia; herbivorous marine mammals related to modern dugongs and manatees) at fossil localities in Mexico and Puerto Rico that are threatened, respectively, by natural erosion and human disturbance. This fieldwork will also support the research of J. Vélez, a Puerto Rican graduate student at Howard University. The fossils known to be at these sites are crucial to his doctoral dissertation, which will revise the classification and clarify aspects of the evolutionary history, paleoecology, and geographic distribution of fossil Sirenia from Puerto Rico, the wider Caribbean, and adjoining areas of the New World. The localities to be visited include ones that produced the type specimens of several sirenians whose identities and affinities need to be clarified by much more adequate fossil material. Besides analyses of their feeding adaptations and evolutionary relationships, the newly-collected fossils will also provide samples of tooth enamel for stable-isotope analysis important for interpreting their feeding ecology.<br/>Baja California Sur, México: In the North Pacific, seacows have been present at least since the early Miocene (circa 25 million years ago), and are represented by all three subfamilies of the family Dugongidae: Halitheriinae, Hydrodamalinae, and Dugonginae. Important fossils of each of these groups have been collected in Baja California. The coexistence of all three groups is very interesting from the standpoint of paleoecology, and a major goal of our research is to understand how these herbivores shared the marine plant resources of the North Pacific coastline. PIs seek better specimens of these sirenians, as well as more information about the other marine animals among which they lived.<br/>Puerto Rico: Fossil seacows in Puerto Rico include both halitheriines and dugongines. Vélez has recently collected important new specimens of both, and the potential of recovering more fossil sirenians (as well as other vertebrates) from the Tertiary deposits in Puerto Rico is high. It also provides a rare opportunity to recover sirenians from the Oligocene, an important but otherwise poorly sampled period in their evolution and diversification. Seacow remains have been collected from other parts of the Caribbean, but they are mostly either from older (Eocene) or younger (Miocene) deposits. Several species of seacows are expected to be found in the different rock layers around the island, further documenting the former existence of multi-species sirenian communities, and possibly including early manatees (Trichechidae)."

DNA microarrays have revolutionized basic research and industrial drug discovery, but have traditionally been difficult to use in clinical diagnostics. DNA microarrays are typically expensive and require long wait-times for data, in part because of the need to chemically label the sample material. In contrast, Synamem Corporation (a Synergenics, LLC business) is developing a novel readout for DNA microarrays using micron-size bead particles which completely eliminates the need to label the sample material, making the process considerably lower-cost and more rapid. This SBIR project will address the following: 1) The DNA microarray label-free readout will be optimized; 2) This readout will be tested in various potential diagnostic applications of DNA microarrays in the field of cancer; and 3) The compatibility of this label-free readout with commercially-available microarrays will be assessed.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are the development of DNA microarrays which could potentially be used in diagnostics on a more cost-effective and time-efficient basis. Successful commercialization and adoption of Synamem's label-free microarray system will greatly simplify the process of measuring gene expression, detecting gene single nucleotide polymorphisms and mutations, and numerous other potential diagnostic applications of DNA microarrays. Indeed, it will enable faster diagnostic results in the clinic, closer to the patient, as it may eliminate the need for sending out samples for lengthy processing in centralized hospital laboratories.<br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."

Lovinger	05/31/2012	"$324,000.00"		crosby@mail.pse.umass.edu	Research Administration Building	Hadley	MA	010359450	4135450698	MPS	1773	"7237, 9161, AMPP"	$0.00	"TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The physical properties of thin polymer films are critical for the development of numerous technologies, ranging from alternative energy sources to ?smart? coatings. In the thin film regime, the size scale of individual molecules is commensurate with the film?s thickness; therefore, the inter-molecular and intra-molecular mechanisms that define a material property are influenced by surface properties. Recent efforts in the polymer scientific community have focused on the impact of confinement on properties such as the glass transition temperature and elastic modulus, but relatively little is known on the impact of geometric confinement on properties related to non-linear deformation. The proposed research will use novel methods to fold and crumple thin polymer films, while quantifying the energy focusing and strain localizing processes involved in these non-linear mechanics. The specific research plan includes three primary efforts: 1) the folding and crumpling of homogenous, thin polymer films; 2) the folding and crumpling of nanostructured polymer films; and 3) the characterization of crumpled surface properties. These efforts will be distinguished from recent research on crumpling by studying films with molecular-scale thickness and combining crumpling mechanics with the properties of pre-patterned substrates to control long-range order in crumpled sheet morphologies. Additionally, the energy focusing processes of folding will be used to assemble nanoscale components, including tailored inorganic nanoparticles. The fundamental knowledge of folding and crumpling gained through this research not only will provide insight into materials properties at molecular length scales, but also will lead to advanced concepts for controlling the morphology and structure of thin polymer films for advanced applications. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The proposed research is focused on developing novel methods to fold and crumple ultra-thin polymer films, which are only a few molecules thick. The results of this research will have broad impact, from providing new knowledge of how molecular assemblies respond to mechanical stress at the nanometer length scale to developing robust strategies for patterning surfaces in future applications, such as alternative energy source technologies. In addition to the research funded by this program, the research team will introduce an innovative program to involve high school students from diverse backgrounds in the creative aspects of scientific research. This program, the Materials Challenges Competition (MCC), will build upon existing programs that are common in undergraduate engineering disciplines (e.g. the solar powered vehicle competition) to initiate a materials competition among high school teams from the Western Massachusetts region. The implementation of this program will provide opportunities for students and the general public in Western Massachusetts to realize the importance of materials research in answering current technological challenges."

Most research has focused on relationship problems that interfere with well-being. However, a number of recent, rigorous studies have found that it is also important that couples associate their relationship with a sense of growth, that relationship boredom can be a major cause of marital distress, and that relationship quality is enhanced when a couple does things together that are novel and exciting. Yet, the research to date has not examined this important process in a significant real-life context, has not yet identified the fundamental underlying principles of just how this process operates, and has not yet delineated the conditions under which this process is particularly likely to operate. This research takes advantage of a unique opportunity to advance knowledge by addressing exactly these issues, issues that have been almost impossible to test with standard research methods and populations. <br/><br/>This research is a unique collaboration between Dr. Arthur Aron and colleagues at SUNY Stony Brook and a non-profit organization called Welcome Home Troops (WHT). WHT provides thousands of U.S. soldiers returning from combat deployments with tickets to exciting events (e.g., NASCAR races, concerts) to attend with their spouses. WHT hopes to help reduce the high divorce rate in this population by giving them a positive, high energy, shared experience, as a couple. WHT is helping the research team connect with 2,000-5,000 married soldiers to better understand how and why their approach might be working, while also providing a unique platform to test basic theory on the role of shared experiences in relationship health. Soldiers and their spouses, along with a matched comparison group, will complete surveys and indirect measures before and immediately after the event, as well as six months later. The findings will illustrate the specific processes that promote relationship health and satisfaction within married couples who have experienced recent separation and stress. Additionally, the work might directly benefit returning soldiers and their families by promoting relationship health and marital satisfaction."

To address this issue, this dissertation research project proposes to modify existing methods for modeling potential distributions of organisms based on their ecological requirements. Specifically ecological niche modeling methods will be used to examine species distributions in three dimensional space, taking the interactions between vertical (depth) and horizontal (latitudinal and longitudinal) axes into account. The hypothesis to be tested is that deep open ocean waters, through their environmental uniformity (e.g., deep-water temperatures are low from the Tropics to the polar regions), provide a means for maintaining continuity among distant populations of those species living there, which results in relatively low species diversity. By contrast, shallow water environments are fragmented, which results in geographic isolation between populations and thus resulting in relatively high species diversity. Potential distribution models will be generated and their predictions tested using molecular genetics. Hydrozoan jellyfishes in the open ocean will be studied in this project and through integration of ecological modeling with molecular analyses the research should contribute to a better understanding of how open ocean biogeographic patterns and biodiversity are generated and maintained.<br/><br/>In addition to furthering the understanding of open ocean environments, there will be opportunities for undergraduate students to partake in this project in order to give them hands-on experience in ongoing research. Results from this research will be communicated to the general public using the online portal of the Sant Ocean Hall of the National Natural History Museum, as well as the project homepage of the Assembling the Cnidarian Tree of Life project. Furthermore, strategies and computer code created for this project will be made available to other researchers through the internet and specimens collected will be deposited at major public museums."

SERMON is a two-day combinatorics and number theory meeting held annually each spring semester at rotating institutions; it is attended by faculty and students from various colleges and universities in the southeast. SERMON originates from UNCG where the first conference was held in 1988. Since then it has taken place every year at various universities in the southeast including University of Georgia, University of South Carolina, Citadel, College of Charleston, Wake Forest, Virginia Tech, Furman, and Clemson University. This yearly conference features 20 minute talks by students and faculty as well as one hour talks by one or more noted mathematicians. This year, SERMON will host Professor Paul Gunnells from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and Professor David Ford from Concordia University, Montreal.<br/><br/>One goal is to encourage collaborative efforts among number theorists and combinatorialists in the southeast by providing a friendly, informal setting where they can come together and hear about recent research in number theory and combinatorics.  In addition to plenary and contributed talks, there will be a session devoted to discussion of open problems in the area. It is also an opportunity for graduate students in the region to meet, interact, and speak about their work with senior researchers. SERMON has a unique familiar atmosphere. The social gathering in the evening traditionally takes place at the home of one of the faculty members. These activities help strengthen bonds between graduate students and senior researchers to facilitate future joint projects.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

To understand this crisis, many factors have been examined including the image of computing and the pedagogy and materials used in introductory classes. Over time, many instructors have experimented with classes that teach fundamental computing constructs and skills through more attractive applications and environments. There is some anecdotal evidence that this approach is effective and some studies that have been carried out with non-majors. This project presents a unique and timely opportunity to test this approach; in the past, finding viable and significantly large comparison groups to support the hypothesis has been a challenge.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: This EAGER project takes advantage of two existing comparison groups in introductory classes that are being taught the same two semesters at the University of California San Diego, one traditional and one using media computing. Students are surveyed to support the hypothesis that teaching computing through a more attractive domain such as media computing will result in better attitudes toward computing among both majors and students who take computing courses to complement their majors. The existence of two viable and significantly large comparison groups is fortunate and provides results of interest to the computer science education research community. This first round of data, expected to support the hypothesis that motivating context will improve attitudes toward engagement in computing classes and immediate intent of students to continue in computing classes and major, enables future projects that examine effects on more enduring retention.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: This lays out a comparative study showing key data that will assist other computing departments in making decisions about curricular change to improve recruitment and retention. Specifically, the attitudes of students taking CS1 with media computation is analyzed and compared to students who are taking a traditional CS1 class absent the hypothesized motivating context. These results are informative to departments that seek an increased number of students applying to their departments, greater numbers of students succeeding in their programs, and overall a student body that is more engaged and positively inclined towards the value of computing in their career and in society. <br/><br/><br/>"

This research project has three parts: to reduce or fix CO2 under mild reaction conditions to produce products (such as CO) that are more amenable to further reaction, to explore the differences in reactivity that are observed during heteroallene reactions with main group compounds, and to investigate the potential catalytic routes to convert CO2 into methylcarbamate or dimethylcarbamate using a nitrogen-ligated, Zn-based cycle. These projects may impact the fixation and sequestration of CO2 on a large scale, reducing CO2 (a greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming) and providing new starting materials for chemical synthesis. Professor Kemp has been successful in attracting and graduating both women and underrepresented minority students. He has developed close interactions with a university in East Africa (Tanzania), bringing promising graduate students from this country to the U.S. for training. It is expected that the majority of these students will return to their former universities as faculty, aiding the economic development of their home institutions and country."

Past work using morphological data indicate that turtles are the most ancient living reptile group although some DNA data conclude that turtles are a younger group more closely related to crocodiles and birds. While most of the current studies using DNA sequences include only a handful of genes, this project will develop a novel genomics approach to sequence 25 nuclear genes for fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. These DNA data, along with the use of fossils will help: 1) determine the position of turtles in the tree of life, 2) resolve relationships within turtles themselves, and 3) provide insight into the tempo and mode of turtle evolution.<br/><br/>The project will incorporate the training of undergraduates from underrepresented groups and results will be used in public outreach to seventh graders. In addition, this work will help resolve a fundamental portion of the tree of life and will provide a framework of future research in comparative evolutionary biology. The DNA technique developed in this project will provide a simple, efficient method for small laboratories to begin collecting genomic-level data previously restricted to large, high-budget laboratories."

Video Semantics will, provide personalized summaries of video content that meet users' preferences. These summaries will be based on shot granularity instead of the widely used key-frame-based summaries that are oblivious of semantics. Additionally, the proposed technology will significantly enhance online video search by enabling users to retrieve only semantically-relevant shots instead of the entire video. The key component of the software is an automated semantic video annotation system that integrates realtime video shot detection, speech recognition, natural language processing, and logic inference methods to accurately select video shots according to semantic user requests and preferences. Consumers and video content service providers will use the proposed adaptive video messaging technique to efficiently communicate queries, preferences and results using Semantic Video Summary messages (SVS). <br/><br/>The proposed software, once commercialized, can affect a shift in the way online video content is searched and retrieved. Moreover, if successful, the software will advance the state-of-the-art of constructing video summaries, which in contrast to current technologies, accurately responds to semantic level user queries. Consequently, the software may be of interest to numerous content providers and consumers to be employed in a multitude of video applications. The software could also be integrated into the ever-popular digital video recorders to enable the owner to search large volumes of archived videos and retrieve specific ones given semantic queries, rather than the usually inaccurate file names. On the other hand, the unique summarization capabilities of the software can be used by content/service providers where personalized, semantic-based summary criteria can be predefined by the user so that the content providers, adaptively (based on network and device capabilities) stream summaries matching users' requirements to their smart phones of other mobile devices.<br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."

Many insects, however, harbor microscopic parasites that are thought to be transmitted solely through the egg from mother to offspring. These microorganisms are termed reproductive parasites because they usually cause abnormalities during reproduction, such as feminization of males, killing of male embryos or development of embryos without fertilization. Most studies of reproductive parasites assume that transmission is strictly from mother to offspring. Surprisingly, recent experimental work has shown that these microorganisms can occasionally spread infectiously among unrelated individuals. The extent of infectious transmission in fruit flies (Drosophila) will be investigated by using DNA markers to detect transfer between individuals and between generations. <br/><br/>The research addresses fundamental process of disease and parasite transmission. Moreover, reproductive parasites such as those examined here have been proposed as biological control agents for some insect-vectored human diseases. If infectious transmission of the parasite is common, current models for pest control will need to be modified to prevent spread of the parasite to non-target insects. The investigators will continue to engage high school students and undergraduates in laboratory research and are developing outreach programs for high school and middle school students. This project is ideal for younger students because it is relatively simple conceptually, interesting (male-killing and feminization piques the interest of young students) and includes components that are technically simple."

However, humans may be able to mitigate these problems by promoting certain ecosystem processes, a concept known as ecosystem services. Two examples are storing carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide, one of the main contributors to climate change, into plants and soil, and recharging rainfall to groundwater. Vegetation controls these services because it stores carbon, but uses water to do so. Human activities, such as conversion of natural vegetation to agriculture, hence can alter the effectiveness of these services. Recognizing the tradeoff between vegetation's control over carbon and water, this research will address how agriculture changes grassland carbon and water storages. The U.S. Great Plains are particularly important because they store large amounts of carbon, occur in drier climates, and contain more than half of U.S. agriculture. Water inputs from irrigation and rain should enhance plant production, which form the basis for carbon storage, but plant production may decrease water availability and deep water storage. To establish a general relationship between water inputs and the services, the study is conducted at six sites along a rainfall gradient in the southern Great Plains in which irrigated and rain-fed agricultures, and grasslands are compared. Deep soil is sampled for carbon and tracer ions to estimate carbon and recharge to groundwater. <br/><br/>The broader impacts include estimation of environmental benefits and costs of agricultural conversion in consideration of multiple ecosystem services. Undergraduate and Masters students will be mentored, and results will be shared with landowners, experimental agricultural stations and local Water Development Boards."

The University will contribute $355K and NASA will contribute $60K toward the purchase. Isotope measurements may be improved by shorter wavelength, faster pulse-width laser ablation systems. Systems with wavelengths in the deep UV and femtosecond pulse widths are beginning to be fielded in the geoscience community. Recent studies show radiogenic isotopes ratios with elements like Sr, Pb and Hf are better preserved from source material when ablated using fsLA. The prime goal for initial experiments is measuring Fe isotopes in individual carbonates produced by microbial Fe3+ reduction. The fsLA system will be necessary to tease out Fe fractionation factors which would not possible with bulk analyses. Measurements with bulk carbonates is particularly challenging because Fe isotopes tend to fractionate during dissolution. The effect is noticeable when sequential acid digestions are performed. The fsLA system should allow individual carbonates to be analyzed mitigating this bias. The PIs present considerable evidence to support the fsLA system over microprobe or SIMS analyses. Combination analysis with both SIMS and fsLA is suggested. The fsLA system will offer a wide range of analytical possibilities to UW-M. Students and post-docs will be able to utilize the system. While Fe isotopes will be initial focus, sedimentary and igneous geochemistry will benefit from shorter pulse laser ablation. Zircon U-Pb and Hf analyses will be possible. Collaborative efforts with the Rare Gas Laboratory at UW-M will also be evident.<br/><br/>***"

The amount of trait recombination varies a great deal with factors such as species, sex, position in the genome of the underlying genes, and environmental conditions such as nutrition, age, temperature, and number of matings. Variation due to the number of matings is an interesting result that leads to the scientific question of whether this could be due to changes that are elicited by males. This project tests for a male-mediated effect on the recombination of traits in their offspring, using the classic model species Drosophila melanogaster to assess whether genetic background, environmental condition, or some combination of the two cause variation in the ability of males to alter their children's level of variation through changing recombination rate. Drosophila males are unique in that they do not carry out recombination; thus the trait proposed could be an indirect mechanism for males to influence the diversity of their progeny.<br/><br/>Understanding factors that contribute to variation in recombination rate is of broad importance to human well being, as recombination plays an important role in certain types of cancers, such as human breast cancer. Further, because environmental conditions are known to alter recombination rates, these environmental triggers are important in our understanding of how such environmental factors as temperature and nutrition may influence genetic diversity in future generations. This project will provide research-based training to and undergraduate and a graduate student and will support classroom lectures and other public and public school education and outreach by the CoPI."

The PI's main <br/>interest in this domain is the existence of generic representations of countable discrete groups in such automorphism groups and its uses in investigating the dynamics and algebraic structure of the automorphism group. <br/>Secondly, the PI will be working on the classical problem of J.P.R.

Again, this problem is tightly connected with the geometry and dynamical properties of Polish groups and very likely to leads to new techniques and concepts of value outside of the study of automatic continuity. <br/>Finally, Rosendal will be continuing his collaboration with V. Ferenczi on the <br/>rough classification of separable Banach spaces, a programme initiated by W. T. Gowers in the course of the solution to the homogeneous space problem. This programme heavily relies on Ramsey theoretical and game theoretical methods from descriptive set theory and thus enriches both descriptive set theory by developing new techniques and functional analysis by contributing to one of the most central problems of Banach space theory. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In recent years, there has been a growing collaboration and sharing of ideas between researchers working in dynamical systems and descriptive set theory. Initially, this was largely fostered by work on Borel equivalence relations but has lately also come to include topological dynamics. The principal objectives of descriptive set theory consists in studying the definable subsets of the real line, showing that these are much better behaved than arbitrary subsets. This has developed into a large structure theory of such sets which gives a solid framework within which most of mathematical analysis takes place, and as such, the use of descriptive set theoretical techniques in parts of functional analysis is continuously expanding."

There is also a hearing infant, now nearing two years of age, who is simultaneously learning ZFHS and the local indigenous language, Tzotzil (Mayan). This research documents this child's bilingual acquisition of Tzotzil and ZFHS and will involve weekly video recordings of the child over the next twelve months. It will also use spontaneous interaction and semi-structured experimental techniques to document the linguistic abilities of the caregiver, in both ZFHS and spoken Tzotzil. Such situations provide an opportunity to explore questions about the nature, origins, and evolution of language. They give insight into how and why particular words come into existence, what sorts of paradigmatic semantic and pragmatic categories accrue to systems of linguistic communication, and how syntax, morphology, and phonology emerge. <br/><br/>Opportunities for research on the languages of the deaf as they evolve in ""natural"" conditions are rare. Most sign language research works with languages which are either well-established or which have come to the attention of researchers only after the first generation of speakers has disappeared. This research will probe the processes of creation, innovation, and change at the beginning of a language's evolution, working together with the full universe of its speakers.  Understanding the potential and expressive capacity of a spontaneously created language like ZFHS, especially in the context of an underrepresented minority populations like Mayan Indians, will impact not only people with communicational disadvantages but, indeed, speakers of minority languages in general, whose communicative abilities are often under-appreciated or recast as direct liabilities to their social and economic lives.

Lovinger	08/31/2013	"$400,000.00"		rlarson@umich.edu	3003 South State St. Room 1062	Ann Arbor	MI	481091274	7347636438	MPS	1773	"9161, AMPP"	$0.00	"TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/> Understanding remains incomplete regarding the relaxation of complex branching structures in entangled polymer melts with multiple branch points, such as H- or comb-branched polymers, or for polymers with branches of differing lengths, such as asymmetric stars and asymmetric H polymers, or for hyperbranched polymers (i.e., with branch-on-branch topology). To address these issues, which are important both scientifically and for applications to commercial polymer manufacture, we are performing a combination of the following tasks: 1. Synthesis of high-quality model branched polymers with branches of the same or different length that are carefully designed to test physical theories. 2. Careful characterization of the molecular weight and branching properties of these polymers. 3. Measurement of the linear rheological properties over a wide frequency range. 4. Comparison of the measured viscoelastic properties with predictions derived from the various alternative proposed theories. We plan to accomplish these tasks through a collaborative framework, involving a collaborator, Jimmy Mays, who will use a novel route to synthesize 1) asymmetric H polymers; 2) asymmetric star-on-star polymers, based on a core star polymer, each branch of which terminates in two unequal length branches; and 3) combs with tetrafunctional branch points. These polymers will be carefully characterized by gel permeation chromatography and TGIC, and studied through rheological measurements, including careful long-time creep rheometry with the help of instrumentations and methods available in the laboratory of Prof. John Dealy, a collaborator at McGill University. Existing computational models for predicting the measured rheology will be employed in collaboration with Chinmay Das in the McLeish group at Leeds University. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>To form advanced plastic fibers or thin plastic sheets used for packaging, molten plastic is pulled or stretched at extremely high speeds. The performance of this process depends on how the polymer molecules in the plastic are entangled with each other, and how they escape those entanglements. Polymers that branch into multiple long strands are exceptionally useful for industry, since they serve as netting that strengthens the plastic so that it does not rip or bursting when blown into shape. Larson?s team has found that changes to as few one branch in a million branch points can significantly impact the properties of the melt relevant to its strength as a melt. The reason for this is that branched polymers entangle extremely well with other branched polymers. To escape these entanglements, they must reconfigure by reeling branches towards the branch point, like Houdini dislocating his shoulder to escape a straight jacket. Therefore, the entanglements are long-lived and make the plastic easier to shape. Larson?s team is chemically synthesizing special branched polymers that are exceptionally useful in determining how branched polymers manage to perform their ?Houdini? acts and how to optimize this for advanced performance. Their measurements of the rates at which polymers escape entanglements is providing knowledge that is of great interest to collaborators at Dow Chemical Company and other plastics manufacturing companies. The research has been highly interdisciplinary and international with collaborators at the University of Tennessee, McGill University, the University of Leeds, and Dow Chemical Company."

The program will focus on the recruitment, retention, mentoring, and graduation of the students from STEM fields pursuing M. S. and Ph.D. degrees in science, technology, engineering, and technology (STEM) fields.<br/><br/>The program objectives for this cohort are: (i) recruitment of 12 LSAMP graduates to the BD program by the start of the grant period, (ii) completion of coursework by each BD Fellow within the first two years of the graduate study, (iii) identification of a research mentor by the start of the 2nd year in the program, (iv) at least 80% of the fellows earning Ph.D. degrees, and (v) each BD fellow earning at least one graduate degree in a STEM field. The program has also identified four key educational outcomes that each BD fellow must achieve prior to graduation. These outcomes are: (i) knowledge of learning methods and effective teaching strategies, (ii) ability to communicate effectively, (iii) ability to perform research independently, and (iv) an understanding of the importance of life-long learning. To achieve these<br/>objectives and outcomes, the program has developed a strong and ambitious plan which includes workshops, seminars, socials, meetings, international research experiences, conference activities for the BD fellows and research mentors.<br/><br/>The BD Fellows of Cohort III will serve as mentors for the new<br/>fellows. Reciprocal exchanges identified between OU and Oklahoma State University?s (OSU) BD programs will benefit all BD students at both universities. The evaluation of the program objectives and<br/>the assessment of the achievement of educational outcomes include input from students, external program evaluator, and the BD Council. BD Council consists of members from OU and OSU including the PI of the Oklahoma Alliance.<br/><br/>The proposed activity involves the furthering the research on what constitutes best practices for the recruitment, retention, and graduation of underrepresented minority students with doctoral degrees in STEM fields. There are several other research initiatives at the University of Oklahoma which are targeted at the success of females and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields such as ADVANCE, IGERT, GAANN programs and Sooner Engineering Education (SEED) Research Center. Collaboration between the BD program and these other programs in the university will not only benefit the BD Fellows but also the faculty engaged in research targeted towards promoting diversity in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The potential impacts of the proposed activity are multidimensional. At the institutional level, success of the BD program will positively impact institutionalization of the best practices. Diversity in the graduate STEM programs will promote diversity in the undergraduate programs and vice versa.<br/><br/>Institutional commitment to diversity as evidenced by a diverse student population will undoubtedly support the efforts of diversifying STEM faculty. For Oklahoma, it will lead to stronger relationships between K-12 schools including tribal establishments and STEM programs, diversification of the pipeline for STEM education, and further stimulating economic development in the state. At the national level, graduation of at least 10 BD Fellows with Ph.D. degrees who have achieved the four key outcomes stated for the program will have a significant impact on the gender and ethnic profiles of STEM faculty in academia, as well as industry and other government agencies employing Ph.D. graduates. Dissemination of best practices through archival paper publications and presentations at professional conferences will<br/>broaden the impact as more institutional will implement the best practices which will in turn transform the ethnic and gender distribution of the STEM workforce and also increase the number of graduates from STEM disciplines."

The worm gathers the mineral component adventitiously as sand grains and bits of seashell hash which it bonds together into a tube with small dabs of a proteinaceous glue in the manner of building a stone wall. The glue sets within 30 s under cold seawater and hardens to a tough leathery consistency through oxidative crosslinking. Technological interest in this bioadhesive stems from its ability to bond a diverse range of mineral substrates under water. The adhesive is secreted as a colloidal suspension with low initial viscosity and interfacial tension that readily spreads on wet substrates, yet it is sufficiently cohesive that it does not disperse into the ocean before setting. Moreover, the water-borne bioadhesive apparently displaces interfacial water, a prerequisite for strong surface adhesion. These properties make the P. californica adhesive a valuable new paradigm for the design of water-borne, underwater adhesives. Several questions remain to be answered about the composition and biological processing of the adhesive. To illustrate, the adhesive gland contains at least two distinct types of secretory granules. (1) How are the glue proteins distributed between the granule types? (2) Are the glue proteins of each granule type expressed in distinct regions of the adhesive gland? (3) Does the mixing of the granule contents during secretion trigger the setting and curing reactions. Experiments have been devised to analyze the composition and biological processing of the adhesive before it sets. The first set of experiments (aim 1) will provide a broad overview of adhesive gland physiology through gene expression analysis. The second set of experiments (aim 2) will use the genetic and antibody probes resulting from aim 1 to investigate functional partitioning of the adhesive gland by examining spatial expression patterns. The third set of experiments (aim 3) will deploy powerful methods and modern mass spectrometry instrumentation to analyze the protein content of freshly secreted adhesive and of individual secretory granules. Peptides will be proteolytically generated and analyzed by micro-liquid chromatography and tandem mass spec (LC/MS/MS). Proteomic analysis will provide direct evidence that the new glue proteins discovered in the expression survey are present in the glue. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: The results of these studies will make progress towards solving important technological issues such as 'wet bonding' of bone-to-bone or bone-to-metal in implants using injectable and biocompatible adhesives as well as other 'under water' adhesive applications."" Integration of teaching and research is achieved in a novel and effective way. The majority of the P. californica adhesive gland EST (expressed sequence tags) database will be developed during an undergraduate laboratory course in Molecular Bioengineering where students learn about construction cDNA libraries, purifying plasmids, automated DNA sequencing, bioinformatics resources, and how these tools are used to investigate biological processes. Students find this experience quite unique compared to canned laboratory exercises. The results are not known before hand, and the students have an authentic opportunity to discover new biotechnological resources. Students take ownership of the genes they are investigating, pursue the bioinformatics analysis, and develop hypotheses about the potential role of their gene in the bioadhesive."

The Arecibo lidar, based on a narrowband injection-seeded alexandrite ring laser, has been able to make nighttime temperature and potassium density measurements in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region since February 2001. Through seven years of operation, the nighttime technology has matured and sufficient data were collected to characterize the nocturnal thermal structure and nocturnal potassium seasonal variations. To enhance its measurement capability and to better serve the aeronomy community, in 2005 a project was proposed and received funding for three years to upgrade the Arecibo lidar to a daytime observing capability and to conduct extensive observations to study the tropical mesosphere and lower thermosphere region over the full-diurnal cycle at the Arecibo Observatory. The lidar modifications have been underway for the past three years but the Faraday filter originally intended to be used did not perform as expected. Many of the other technical goals of the previous project were achieved, such as narrowing of the field-of-view, construction of the Faraday filter test station, implementation of the new receiver optical chopper, initial observational tests, and implementation of new data processing techniques. In addition, the optical elements and hardware necessary to construct a new Faraday filter were acquired. The project will therefore complete the remaining steps to yield a daylight-optimized lidar capable of making full diurnal observations at Arecibo, where its collocation with the incoherent scatter radar will enable a wide variety of scientific studies, such as measurements of tides, gravity waves, absolute atmospheric density, metal layer chemistry, and the evolution of sporadic atom and ion layers."

Bird, Mr. Brian F. Codding will examine the material (i.e., archaeologically visible) residues that result from variability in gendered foraging activities among Martu, an indigenous group who live in remote communities in Australia's Western Desert. Today, many Martu hunt and gather on a daily basis. A typical foraging bout begins with a foraging party travelling together to a temporary day-camp from which men and women usually operate separately, engaging in mutually exclusive foraging activities that occur in different habitats (e.g., men may target hill kangaroo while women focus on sand monitor lizards). After several hours, the party regroups at the day-camp to cook, process, share and consume most of the food acquired during the day. The group then typically returns to the community, leaving behind the material remains of the day's activities. <br/><br/>Because gender differences in labor are common in almost all human societies but are rare among other primates, questions about why humans have such differences and why they vary lie at the heart of many influential arguments about the evolutionary origins of human family formation and cooperative social organization. Yet despite its importance, there is little agreement among anthropologists and archaeologists about when and why gendered occupations became prominent features of human social arrangements. Addressing these issues requires an understanding of how archaeological residues represent the gendered foraging decisions made by individuals. However, since the archaeological record is an accumulation of individual behaviors, materials do not read as a straightforward window to individual subsistence practices. In order to work towards a solution to this problem, this research will quantify observed foraging behavior and the linked material remains deposited at each camp. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the archaeological consequences of foraging behavior and how these are related to gendered decisions about resource use. By combining observational data with the analysis of its material residues, this work aims to provide the tools necessary to examine gendered foraging decisions in the past through the residues of foraging alone. Developing such clear archaeological signatures of the gender division of foraging labor will contribute directly toward understanding a wide range of issues in human prehistory, from the emergence of the genus Homo to processes of economic and political intensification.<br/><br/>This research also has the potential to provide a broader impact on the public's understanding of these issues. Specifically, this work provides the funds to train one PhD student and Martu research assistants who will help with the duration of the project in archaeological survey and excavation techniques. This training will provide an important background for Martu who are actively involved in the management and preservation of their cultural heritage. Working directly with Parnngurr Community School and the Parnngurr Community Council, the results of this research will also be publicized through collaborative websites. In so doing, this work aims to provide a deeper public understanding of the range of variability in family dynamics and their material expressions."

The rate of this retreat has varied greatly, Preliminary numerical mass-balance modeling indicate that changes in tributary glaciers that feed the main valley glacier may be the key to predicting the response of system to changes in climate. Excluding these smaller, tributary glaciers from models underestimates the magnitude and response time of the glacier terminus to changes in climate. However, the model does not yet include ice dynamics. The physical and chemical properties of ice within tributary glaciers may be drastically different than those of neighboring tributaries and the main valley glacier. It thus follows that physical properties of tributary glaciers will influence the dynamics of the glacier system as a whole, influencing both the rate and magnitude of glacier responses to changes in climate. This project will investigate the influence of tributary glaciers on ice dynamics of the Gornergletscher system, and how changes in tributary glaciers then influence the response time and sensitivity of alpine glaciers to changes in climate. This will be accomplished by analyzing the chemical and physical properties of ice in several shallow (~15 m) ice cores along a traverse through the tributary and main valley glaciers. Together with ground-penetrating radar (GPR along the same transect, the ice-core data will determine the physical and chemical ice properties within tributary glaciers on the Gornergletscher, and to quantify the influence of tributary glaciers on the internal ice dynamics of the main valley glacier.<br/><br/>The potential societal impacts of the near world-wide retreat of glaciers over the past century has been of the focus of much discussion in the scientific, economic, and political communities. Changes in these glaciers will greatly affect freshwater resources, hydroelectric power, tourism, local climate, and sea-level rise, among other things. Additionally, past climate reconstructions from records of past glacier extent often serve as the primary descriptor of the climate history of a region, and have proven critical for quantifying natural climate variability. Numerical glacier models are essential tools in studies of glacier sensitivity to climate change past, present, and future However, glacier retreat over the last century has been larger than was predicted by glacier models, challenging our understanding of glacier sensitivity to changes in climate. Given the current thinning and retreat rate of glaciers in many regions of the world, it is imperative that accurate reconstructions and predictions of glacier response to climate scenarios be provided. This project will greatly increase the knowledge of glacier sensitivity to climate change and improve the accuracy of numerical glacier models."

Conservationists have worried that the new acoustic background dominated by human-generated noise may negatively affect many birds, namely because they rely heavily on vocal communication and noise may mask or drown-out their songs and calls, rendering them functionally silent. This may be especially problematic because acoustic characteristics of bird vocalizations are constrained by a species? evolutionary history and body size to specific frequency ranges and amplitude limits. In other words, species have acoustic niches and may unable to adjust vocalizations to effectively communicate in our noisy world. Recently, however, a few birds have been shown to have some flexibility in their acoustic niche and adjust their vocalizations to overcome the masking effects of noise. In this project, the investigators aim to 1) determine whether acoustic niche flexibility is common or rare within an avian community and 2) evaluate whether a species? ability to occupy noisy habitat is dependent on acoustic niche flexibility. To achieve these objectives the investigators will focus their research on ten species known to vary markedly in their tolerance to noise: four species that avoid noisy habitat, two species that prefer noisy habitat, and four species that appear uninfluenced by noise. For each species, the investigators will record and measure vocalization characteristics from many individuals singing or calling throughout a noisy intensity gradient. Because the project is a community-wide approach, results will enhance the limited understanding of the universality of acoustic niche flexible among bird species. This is especially important in terms of avian conservation in and around human-altered landscapes because it will provide needed insight as to why many species abandon noisy areas and why a handful may flourish."

Magnetic fields extract angular momentum from the gas that forms a star, thereby determining whether a gas cloud forms a single star or a binary. The radiation emitted by stars as they form can suppress fragmentation, thereby enabling just one or two stars to form in a region that would have formed many in the absence of thermal feedback. For the first time, frequency-dependent radiative transfer will be used to study the effects of thermal feedback in the formation of low-mass stars. Previous theoretical research has shown that ionized regions associated with the first stars are of particular importance since they determine the masses of these stars. <br/><br/>In addition, this project will explore the formation of stars in groups and clusters. Most stars form in clusters, and indeed it is likely that the Sun formed in a large cluster that contained high-mass stars as well as low-mass stars like the Sun. The formation of star clusters is affected by the powerful feedback mechanisms that accompany star formation, including protostellar outflows and, for massive stars, photoionization and radiation pressure. Both semi-analytic theory and simulation will be used to investigate the formation of clusters of high-mass stars. The results will be compared with observations of star clusters in the Galaxy and of super star clusters in other galaxies. Star formation on galactic scales is determined by the properties of the interstellar medium of the galaxy. <br/><br/>Star formation is central to contemporary astrophysics. As the process by which gas is transformed into stars, it determines the structure and evolution of galaxies. By tapping the nuclear energy in the gas left over from the Big Bang, it determines the luminosity of galaxies and, quite possibly, leads to the reionization of the universe. Most of the elements, including those that make up the world around us, are formed in stars. Finally, the process of star formation is inextricably tied up with the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. A theory of star formation must address both the formation of individual stars and the formation of systems of stars, ranging <br/>from clusters to galaxies. <br/><br/>This grant will fund the education of one or more graduate students who will contribute to education and add to the diversity of the scientific work force. Developments in computational methodology will be published for use by the community."

This paradigm is inadequate in many<br/>applications. First, there is often uncertainty in the model and data;<br/>this is being dealt with by a recent upsurge of work in stochastic and<br/>robust optimization. Second, users often require a simple approximate<br/>solution rather than a more complicated exact solution. When the<br/>problem is formulated in the appropriate space, simplicity is often<br/>manifested as sparsity - the vector of variables has relatively few<br/>nonzeros. Inclusion of nonsmooth regularization terms in the<br/>formulation can steer the model toward sparse solutions. This proposal<br/>focuses chiefly on algorithms and theory for sparse and regularized<br/>optimization, and on application of the methods to such important<br/>areas as compressed sensing, machine learning, computational<br/>statistics, and image processing. The project also takes a<br/>higher-level view, cross-fertilizing algorithmic ideas across<br/>different application areas, and devising and analyzing algorithms in<br/>general settings that encompass many specific applications. <br/><br/><br/>Optimization methods can be used to solve a great variety of practical<br/>problems, such as design of cancer treatment plans, removing noise and<br/>blur from images and videos, identifying genomic and environmental<br/>risk factors for diseases, and reconstructing pictures, signals, and<br/>other data sets from limited random samples. Precise mathematical<br/>formulations of these optimization problems are available, and exact<br/>solutions can often be obtained, but what is needed in many cases is a<br/>simple, approximate solution that is easy to compute, understand, and<br/>apply. To take one example: Many images can be stored by taking a<br/>small number of random combinations of the pixels that make up the<br/>image. The optimization algorithm that reconstructs the original<br/>picture from the samples should look for the simplest picture that is<br/>roughly consistent with the random observations; this image is likely<br/>to appear more natural than complicated images that give an exact<br/>match to the data. This project investigates how the mathematical<br/>statements of problems like this one, and the mathematical methods<br/>that solve them, can be modified to produce simple solutions."

A laser direct writing technique using high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser will be explored to produce compact 3D lightwave circuits. The approach takes advantages of multi-photon process induced by ultrashort laser pulses to initialize a universal photosensitivity response to change refractive indices in a wide array of optical materials. Bulk heating effects from high-repetition laser pulses will be utilized to mitigate laser-induced material damages to minimize optical loss and to achieve desired device performance of lightwave circuits. To fabricate 3D periodic photonic structures, multi-layer near-field diffractive optical elements will be developed to produce 3D interference patterns. Periodic photonic structures such as diamond-like photonic crystals will be fabricated using this one-optical-element and one-laser-exposure holographic fabrication process. <br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will yield a cross-platform laser manufacturing technique to fabricate high-quality lightwave circuits in a wide array of optical substrates. The fabrication technique will enable new 3D photonic circuit architectures that allows lightwave circuits to be routed vertically and continuously in- and out- of a plane. This will drastically increase the density, functionality, and complexity of the optical circuitry. The success of this research will also enable the fabrication of mid-IR fiber lasers and sensor devices for applications in chemical sensing and structural health monitoring in harsh environments. The holographic laser fabrication developed from this award can be conveniently built into the existing multiple mask fabrication flow for integrated optoelectronic circuit manufacturing. This enables the monolithic integration of photonic crystal structures with other on-chip optical components for widespread applications. This award will also support an interdisciplinary training program for undergraduate students on the integrated laser manufacturing and product innovation. Through undergraduate extracurricular activities on robotics and minority outreach activities, the proposed education programs will attract female and under-represented minority students to study engineering and science at both undergraduate and graduate levels."

Assessment of grain size distribution is essential to the classification. Despite significant shortcomings, grain size analysis is ubiquitously performed by sieve and hydrometer tests. A research program is therefore being undertaken to develop the hardware, analytical tools and software for characterization of soils from images of grain assemblies collected in the laboratory; above ground in the field; and from below the ground surface. The effort may result in cleaner, quicker, more efficient, less costly and more accurate grain size determination and stratigraphic delineation. <br/><br/>Earlier image processing efforts were successful at determining the dominant grain size when particles are relatively uniform in size, or if the particles can be quickly segregated by size prior to image capture. The assessment of grain size distribution from images becomes orders of magnitude more complex when a soil contains a range of grain sizes. Previous techniques using image textural features and wavelet mathematics have paved the way for new methods including edge pixel density (EPD), edge segment size (ESS) and mathematical morphology that will yield more complex grain size distributions. The newer techniques may necessitate image capture at a range of magnifications.<br/>For the laboratory, a system is being developed for rapidly segregating a soil specimen by size using a sedimentation column. This permits piecewise image collection and assemblage of a traditional grain size distribution curve. The hardware and image collection system is being designed to facilitate size recognition down to 0.005 mm diameter, the commonly cited size threshold between ?silt? and ?clay?. The hardware development will be performed as part of an interdisciplinary undergraduate design project with students from several disciplines including civil/geotechnical engineering, mechanical design, image processing and mathematical statistics.<br/><br/>For field applications, the research will develop a rapid response system to determine the grain size distribution of soils at the ground surface using two different approaches: mathematical morphology and edge detection to determine edge pixel density (EPD) and edge segment size (ESS). Preliminary evidence suggests these methods applied to images taken at multiple scales may provide the grain size distribution of even well-graded soils without the need for particle segregation. The research will also develop a rapidly deployable field portable computer and camera system. <br/><br/>For subsurface grain size assessment, the vision cone penetrometer (VisCPT) will be used for image collection. Earlier studies have shown that textural indices can only detect changes in stratigraphy, but grain size determination has been too complex a problem. With the newly proposed image processing methods, in-situ grain size determination becomes tractable. VisCPT data will be collected at an exceptionally well characterized sand and gravel quarry in southwestern Indiana. Existing available date data includes continuous soil sampling and grain size distributions to a depth of 20 meters. The glacial outwash site includes a large assortment of soil gradations ranging from sandy gravels to clayey silts.<br/><br/>The imaging methods developed herein for soil grain size characterization have direct application to other disciplines and industries where the sizing of manufactured components at various scales, ingredients in preparations, naturally occurring biologic or geologic matter, and interpretation of remotely sensed objects through image processing are essential to quality control, inspection, diagnosis, state assessment, and prediction of future behavior. Such industries include pharmaceuticals, food processing, materials science, powder metallurgy, microbiology and others."

The approach includes: synthesis of blends of semiconducting carbon nanotubes with organic and inorganic semiconductors using wet chemical and solution-based blending techniques; characterization of the internal morphology of these blends as a function of processing conditions and materials selection; identification of composite materials that will form a type II (donor/acceptor) heterojunction with semiconducting carbon nanotubes; studies to determine mechanisms responsible for exciton dissociation and charge collection in carbon nanotube/semiconductor blends; quantification of rates for exciton dissociation, charge separation, and charge recombination in the blends; and, quantification of the electron affinity and ionization potential of monodisperse semiconducting carbon nanotubes. It is expected that photogenerated charge carriers in carbon nanotubes can be dissociated and collected by synthesizing donor/acceptor blends of semiconducting carbon nanotubes with more or less electronegative semiconductors. Emphasis is placed on understanding the interrelationship between synthesis, processing, composition, morphology, and properties of such blends. A variety of semiconductors will be investigated to complement the carbon nanotubes in the blends including fullerene-derivatives, semiconducting polymers, and semiconductor oxides. The morphology of the blends will be characterized via scanning probe and electron microscopy as a function of the processing conditions and materials selections. Electronic transport, photoluminescence quenching, spectrally resolved photocurrent, and transient photo-induced absorption measurements will be used to assess the optoelectronic properties of these materials. <br/>Non-Technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new understanding and capabilities for materials combinations with potential for improvements in conversion of solar power to electricity. The scientific investigations will also train students; in addition to supporting one graduate student, the project will promote teaching, training, and learning through the integration of undergraduate students into a research setting. The project also provides support for two summer students in the PI?s laboratory through UW-Madison's SURE/REU (Summer Undergraduate Research Experience and Research Experience for Undergraduates) program. The SURE/REU program primarily supports students in under-represented groups. Additionally, the project supports a UW-Madison undergraduate student for the academic year. Topics such as ethics, how to do research efficiently, problem solving, networking, research safety, experimental procedure, and results presentation will be integrated with day-to-day laboratory training."

These traits vary widely among flowering plant species, but some species are very specialized in the pollinators and the type of fertilization they use. One hypothesis that has been long debated is whether having flowers that are specialized for particular pollinators leads to the evolutionary diversification of more plant species. This project aims to study pollinator and breeding systems in a group of several dozen species in the evening primrose plant family to test this hypothesis. The researchers will use DNA sequences of several genes to reconstruct the evolutionary tree of these evening primroses, and the team will examine details of the pollination process, such as types of pollinators and the nectar and pollen gathered by them. They will then determine whether shifts in pollinator and breeding systems are associated with the evolution of greater numbers of species.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the study include the training of undergraduates in field and laboratory research and the development of collaborations with plant ecologists. The grant supports the research of a female graduate student, who will do outreach work with local high schools and give lectures to conservation groups. Evening primroses are one of many groups of plants that depend upon animal pollinators for their reproduction, and the details of these interactions in the group are important to understand the process of plant reproduction."

(1) The infinity Laplacian operator arises from minimizing the L-infinity norm of the gradient and a two person differential game called ?tug-of-war?. The PI intends to solve several problems from the?tug-of-war? game. One of the important questions is to see how we can use the game theory interpretation to understand more about the infinity Laplacian equation, a highly degenerate nonlinear elliptic equation. The PI also intends to characterize asymptotic behaviors of principle eigenfunctions of p-Laplacian operators as p goes to infinity. Other problems concern properties of classical solutions of the infinity Lapalcian equation and uniqueness of absolute minimizers from minimizing more general norms of the gradient. (2) The aim of the weak KAM theory is to use pde approaches to study the Aubry-Mather theory. Our major goal here is to find a variational method to identify the Aubry set. (3) It was known that generalized solutions of Monge-Ampere equations from the optimal mass transfer problems might have singularities. The PI plans to use some tools developed with P. Cannarsa to explore the regularity of the set of singularities. (1) Equations involving the infinity Laplacian operator are very different from elliptic PDEs that people knew before. On one hand, they are second order. On the other hand, the infinity Laplacian operator is so degenerate that those equations sometimes behave as first order PDEs, for example, their solutions even possess some sort of characteristics. Proposed problems in this topic require new methods and ideas which will enhance people's knowledge of elliptic PDEs. Beside its extreme mathematical interest, the infinity Laplacian operator also has important applications in practical issues, for example, to restore images with poor dynamical range, to determine the optimal strategy in the tug-of-war game which is applicable to economic and political modeling, etc. (2) Very little has been known about the structure of the Aubry-Mather set when the dimension is bigger than two. The research proposed in the weak KAM theory part may provide a numerical method to approximate the Aubry set. (3) Monge-Ampere equations from optimal transfer problems have interesting applications in meteorology. The semigeostrophic equations from meteorology can be formulated as a coupled Monge-Ampere/transport problem. The results about the set of singularities of generalized solutions of the Monge-Ampere equation should help people understand how fronts arise in large scale weather pattern."

The workshop will be held at Northwestern University in late July to early August of 2009. We are planning for up to 15 students and five or more guest lecturers in addition to the PIs. This will be a hands-on short course with lectures followed by computer exercises designed to reinforce the concepts being taught. Some exercises will use local computers, but many of the exercises will utilize high performance computing machines that are part of the NSF sponsored teragrid consortium. Students will complete a design concept project at the conclusion of the workshop. They will be required to attempt to implement their design after the workshop and present the results in the fall of 2009 in a webinar.

These observations, combined with the space-based data, will address two fundamental questions related to the formation of giant and terrestrial planets: (1) When and through which mechanisms do gas disks disperse? (2) Can water vapor remain long in the disk to affect the water abundance of terrestrial planets? Specifically, Dr. Pascucci and her collaborators will:<br/><br/>(1) Investigate how to use the emission line from ionized neon at 12.81 microns to trace dissipating gas disks. Disk models predict that this emission is a sensitive tracer of small gas masses in the terrestrial and giant planet forming region of disks. The Spitzer Space Telescope has detected spatially and spectrally unresolved neon emission lines toward many young disks. Dr. Pascucci and her collaborators will use ground-based telescopes to spectrally resolve bright neon lines from 30 prototoplanetary disks. By measuring the widths, peak velocities, and modeling the line profiles, they will separate the emission originating in a disk from that in a jet/outflow and measure the disk radii contributing to the spectal flux, and reveal if X-rays or ultraviolet photons are the major ionization source for neon atoms. This can clarify the role of photoevaporation in dispersing gas disks and guide the use of the numerous spectrally unresolved neon lines in measuring the timescale over which gas disperses.<br/><br/>(2) Map out the distribution and evolution of water in protoplanetary disks. A key yet unanswered question is how Earth acquired its water. A new emerging scenario suggests that this happened relatively early, before Earth was fully formed, by accretion of hydrated silicates migrating inward from the outer asteroid belt. Models of the transport of water in an evolving protoplanetary disk identify robust trends in the evolution of water vapor. Dr. Pascucci and her collaborators will acquire the datasets to test these models. In particular, they will obtain high-resolution L-band spectra of disks in different evolutionary stages that have mid-infrared water lines detected with Spitzer. They will model the line profiles using various codes to: a) estimate the properties of the gas traced by the L-band water lines; and b) investigate if water emission lines are correlated with the disk evolutionary stage as proposed by disk models. Finally, they will work on the combined interpretation of L-band, mid-infrared and far-infrared water lines that they will obtain from their approved Herschel Key program to map out the distribution and evolution of water in protoplanetary disks. <br/><br/>The proposed work is an essential complement to current and upcoming space-based observations, necessary to fully understand the evolution of gas in disks and the implications of this evolution on the formation of giant and terrestrial planets. This research program will form the basis for a PhD thesis for a Johns Hopkins University graduate student and offer small- and large- scale projects for undergraduate students interested in planet formation studies. These activities will train students in using state-of-the-art ground- and space-based facilities and in addressing some of the most fundamental questions in planet formation studies."

This study aims to use novel landscape genetic methods to identify landscape features and habitat variables that may shape individual movement and population biology in the federally threatened gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus). This will aid in our understanding of how natural and human-influenced landscape features affect tortoise distribution. The results will greatly assist in the designation of conservation management areas based on landscape features that form natural boundaries to populations and the unique genes they contain. At the individual level, genetic analyses will be combined with detailed ecological data to test hypotheses about the relative importance of particular aspects of the habitat in shaping local movements. The information gained from this study will also be combined with data on the occurrence of an emerging infectious disease to better understand how landscape and ecology may affect disease transmission.<br/><br/>The proposed research has the potential to advance the field of landscape genetics by demonstrating its direct applicability to population management issues for threatened and endangered species. This work has already provided research opportunities for several undergraduate minority students and with the current funding an additional student will receive field and laboratory training. Results from this research will be disseminated in a variety of educational settings including educational outreach at local high schools, presentations at professional meetings, and publication in peer-reviewed journals."

Animals can be important avenues of nutrient movement across space. Humans have altered these nutrient flows, both by eliminating some species, and by introducing others which can lead to many direct and indirect impacts on ecological function. Feral swine - a species which was first introduced to the New World by the Spaniards and are now widespread and abundant - is a classic example of a species that can potentially have large impacts upon nutrient flows among habitats. A detailed study of impacts of feral pigs upon ecosystem nutrient flows is being undertaken in the Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge, located on the Gulf Coast of Florida. The landscape consists of forested islands interlaced in salt marsh. The pigs use the islands as refuges, and their intense use of these areas has led to high deposition of fecal material in the island forest habitats. Surveys revealed higher nutrient levels in the island forest soil compared to mainland forest soil, and there appear to be considerable impacts upon local plant communities. Exclosures have been set up to determine whether feral hogs are indeed responsible for increased nutrients in these refuges areas, and to examine their impact on the plants. To determine the source of the deposited nutrients, the diet of the hogs is being determined through analysis of fecal and bone samples. Genetic analysis of DNA in the feces will permit an estimation of population size and, combined with the effect the population has on nutrient deposition, will allow a 'per hog' expression of the impact of feral hogs on the nutrient flows. <br/><br/>Feral and wild pigs are found globally and are often very abundant in the southeastern U.S.A. Refuge and park managers consider them to be very destructive, but past work has not quantified the magnitude of their impacts on nutrient flows, even though it is clear that they can profoundly alter local ecological processes. The results of this study should have wide applicability, providing basic knowledge that can assist management of many disturbed ecosystems. The project also enriches science education. Undergraduates will be involved in both in the fieldwork and in laboratory analysis. Students will be encouraged to develop their own related projects. One student will examine the imprint of periodic food scarcity as well as disease recorded in tooth enamel and bones. The student will eventually apply the results to the archaeological remains of human populations. One unusual aspect of the educational experience provided by involvement with this project is that students will be interacting with a wide range of non-academic users of the refuge, for instance by the preparation of educational materials and Powerpoint presentations made available to the general public via organizations like the Friends of Lower Suwannee and the National Wildlife Refuge system."

Failure to do so can activate innate defense responses from the host. Perhaps in response to the challenges from the host, viruses have adapted a number of regulatory mechanisms, many of which work either synergistically or as molecular switches to shut down other processes. This project will study how regulatory processes are integrated during the infection of a model plus-strand RNA virus named Brome Mosaic Virus (BMV). The three objectives of the project will: 1) examine the role of two cellular proteins that compete for binding of the viral RNA motif that regulates minus-strand RNA synthesis, 2) determine how the BMV capsid protein can regulate the transition from RNA synthesis to RNA encapsidation, and 3) characterize also how a key BMV replication protein plays a dual role in translation and the assembly of the viral replication enzyme complex. The focus of this work represents a more integrative approach to studies of the viral infection process the anticipated result should be informative for all RNA viruses. In addition, the anticipated results will contribute to our understanding of gene regulation, protein-RNA interactions, and crosstalk between basic processes. This research will also provide a forum to train students as problem solvers. Students will be trained to use interdisciplinary approaches to study viral pathogens. Over two dozen students, ranging from high schoolers to postdocs, including underrepresented inorities, have been trained on this project with prior support. The next phase of this research will continue this training tradition."

The first topic is on rational W-algebras and modular invariant representations. Quantum Hamiltonian reduction has been developed as a powerful tool for solving many open problems coming from physics and representation theory. The next goal is classification of rational W-algebras, which should play an important role in Conformal field theory. The basic idea is to utilize modular invariant representations of affine Lie algebras. The second topic is on four fundamental algebra structures. This is a general framework, which unites in one picture Poisson algebras, associative algebras, Poisson vertex algebras and vertex algebras, that underline classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, classical field theory, and the simplest quantum field theory, respectively. The third topic is on classification of freely generated simple vertex and Poisson vertex algebras. A conjecture on classification of freely and finitely generated vertex algebras and Poisson vertex algebras is discussed. The ""infinite"" problem is reduced to a finite, but ""non-linear'"" problem. A computer search for the latter has confirmed the conjecture.<br/>The fourth topic is on Poisson vertex algebras and infinite-dimensional integrable Hamiltonian systems. Poisson vertex algebras is the most adequate language for the theory of Hamiltonian PDE. This point of view leads to further development of the integrability theory of evolutionary equations. The last topic is on Lie conformal algebra cohomology and calculus of variations. The goal is to study the relation of the classical variational complex to the cohomology theory of Lie conformal algebras. This connection should lead to further development of both theories.<br/><br/>It is expected that this proposal will have a significant unifying impact upon several branches of mathematics and, possibly, upon theoretical physics. For example, the development of the theory of classical and quantum W-algebras should lead to further progress in the theory of classical and quantum integrable systems. The theory of four fundamental algebraic structures should lead to deeper understanding of connections between representation theory, topology and soliton theory on the one hand and the four fundamental frameworks of physics theories on the other hand. The theory of Poisson vertex algebras should lead to further development of the theory of integrable systems, such as the KdV hierarchy and the non-linear Schrödinger hierarchy. The cohomology theory of Lie conformal algebras should lead to a better understanding of the variational calculus, a theory that goes back to the works of Euler and Lagrange."

Such solar cells promise low production costs, while offering low weight and mechanical flexibility. The electronic structure of materials interfaces in the solar cells is crucial for exciton dissociation, recombination prevention, and charge transfer. In order to further increase efficiency and open circuit voltage, it is essential to understand the electronic structure of these interfaces. The main analytical techniques employed in this project include photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopies, which allow the direct measurement of charge injection barriers at molecular heterointerfaces. The enabling preparative technique for these experiments is in-vacuum electrospray deposition, which has been established in recent years through previous efforts in the PI's group. This unique combination of photoemission spectroscopy, inverse photoemission spectroscopy, and electrospray deposition in the same experimental system allows the characterization of occupied and unoccupied states at macro-molecular interfaces at the same time. Additionally, feasibility of spray-based fabrication of solar cell structures using the electrospray deposition at atmospheric pressure is investigated in this project. The electrostatics offers ways for controlling the microscopic morphology of deposited films.<br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance.

The motions of the stellar clumps will be measured from the Doppler shift of their spectral lines. The averaged motion will show how fast the outer parts of the galaxy rotate about its center, and the mass density of the outer disk can be inferred from the way that the motion of individual clumps of stars deviates from that mean.

The studies proposed will use solution state light scattering analyses of cloud point behavior mostly using a bulk phase microanalytical automated digital melting point apparatus to study small scale samples in parallel. Other analytical techniques will be employed too. For example, fluorescence spectroscopy with labeled polymers will probe polymer aggregation events that occur before and after visible phase separation starts and ends. The effects of small molecule and macromolecular co-solutes on LCSTs of a variety of polymers with structurally isomeric repeating units will be carried out to determine how ionic, covalent and macromolecular co-solutes affect a given polymer's LCST. The structural and chemical information generated in these solution-state studies will then be used to develop new sorts of stimuli-responsive surfaces that reversibly change between being superhydrophobic or hydrophilic. Such surfaces physical properties will also be studied to determine if the hydration changes of the polymer grafts alter surface mechanical properties such as viscoelasticty and adhesion. These surfaces with be studied using a battery of analytical methods. The surface structural changes associated with reorganization of these surfaces that will be in the form of thin film nanocomposites in response to solutes in bulk water component will be followed, and, in suitable cases, will be monitored in real time.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This proposed work will study the molecular details of stimuli-responsive macromolecular solubility. This will primarily involve studies of how a macromolecule's temperature-dependent solubility changes in response to the presence of other species in solution. These studies will include studies of aqueous polymer solutions and studies of polymer-containing coatings on solid surfaces. Such responsive polymer solubility studies are important because such materials are components of responsive catalysts and sensors. Polymer solubility and the temperature dependence of polymer solubility is also critically important in determining the stability and activity of proteins and enzymes. Extending studies of solution behavior of macromolecules to include surfaces will lead to a better understanding of responsive wettability of surfaces and the design of 'smart' surfaces. Such 'smart' surfaces have potential as new materials that are self cleaning, that have controllable adhesion, or that have varied surface friction. These studies will have broader impacts that include both undergraduate and graduate education in the research laboratory and classroom. Extramural dissemination of results in presentations to audiences in industry, at predominantly undergraduate institutions, and at international venues will publicize the results of these studies. The chemical methodology used in this research will be developed into experiments that will be used in freshman chemistry courses to educate students about the consequences of enthalpy and entropy in macromolecule hydration. International research collaborations will be fostered and will involve programs with groups in Europe, China, and Qatar."

The conference is designed to enhance both the educational and the research atmosphere of the active community of geometers and topologists in Texas and the surrounding states. The conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their research and to interact with mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states. Summaries of talks with notation of important results have been publicly reported for some time and will continue similarly in the future.<br/><br/>By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis.

Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base.<br/>In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&M University) on a pilot project to foster research opportunities for junior faculty."

Plants species show exceptional diversity as well. Many species of plants grow only in specific soil types. The wild buckwheats (Eriogonum) are a group of plants that include many of these soil specialists (edaphic endemics). This project examines these patterns using modern DNA sequencing and classic greenhouse experiments to determine if there is an evolutionary pattern relating to these soil specialists. It will also address whether these species are specifically adapted to these soils, or if they can survive on a variety of soils.<br/><br/> This project reaches across many disciplines, incorporating principles of botany, evolutionary biology, soil science, and ecology. The results of this project will add to the knowledge relating to the distribution of rare plant species, especially pertaining to soils. Unique methods incorporated in this project will be disseminated for other researchers to use and improve. A number of species in the study group are rare or endangered. Data gathered from fieldwork will be vital to various conservation agencies, for implementing sound, well-informed policies."

The entire proteome of these organisms is designed to function at low pH, by global adaptation of each protein for acidic conditions and/or by the action of putative acid chaperones. The goal of this project is to understand acid stable enzymes in Acetobacter aceti, an economically significant, non-pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium that converts ethanol into vinegar, a strong acetic acid solution that kills other microorganisms. Acetic acid seeps constantly into the cytoplasm of A. aceti, which routinely reaches pH 4. Because they have been adapted to function at low pH, cytoplasmic enzymes from A. aceti are excellent models for investigating acid stability in proteins. Biophysical and enzymological methods are used to understand how these proteins fold and function under harsh conditions. Previous studies of thermophilic enzymes have advanced our fundamental understanding of protein structure and provided useful materials for biotechnology (e.g., PCR). This research follows a similar course with a different extreme environment, acidic pH. Design principles derived from these studies may be used to improve biocatalysts and to understand protein folding.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The educational component of this award involves teaching, training and outreach activities. Bioprocess technology requires suitable biocatalysts, enzymes or microbes able to carry out particular chemical transformations. A new practical laboratory experience will be developed to challenge students to find and characterize new pollutant-degrading reactions in microbial bioremediation consortia. Precollege students and science teachers will participate in the selection and improvement of consortia that degrade non-toxic dyes. Students with a range of backgrounds readily grasp the environmental relevance of using microbiological and chemical analysis methods to discover valuable enzymatic activities."

The investigators of this project have identified problems that on-line tutors have with creating conditions for students to regulate their own behavior. Instead of taking advantage of the available learning opportunities, some students ask for hints until the tutor gives them the correct answer. <br/><br/>The investigators hypothesize that lasting benefits require changing students beliefs about shallow compared with deep modeling practices and breaking their modeling habits and instilling new ones. They intend to add affective learning companions to the on-line tutors. The modules use the teachable agent metaphor called Betty's Brain. <br/>The study analysis will be conducted in high school summer schools in Arizona for students that are mostly Native Americans. The students are self-selected for attending the summer school. Data collection will include student logs, verbal protocols and affect sensor data from the summer school participants (approximately 30 students). Three studies will be conducted: 1. to develop a meta tutoring tool, 2. to develop an affective learning agent with verbal and physical gestures, and 3. a measure of whether the new tool results in increases in learning. The analysis will involve causal inference and data mining of student records of their activities. The third phase of the learning will compare students who use one agent with the teachable agent; a second group will compare two agents, the teachable agent and the meta-tutor; and a third group will compare three agents. The outcome of the study is a developed and tested tool to increase student learning and statistical analysis of records maintained by the investigators of student activities with the teachable agent. The study should help indicate whether computer tutors are more effective if they have integrated features that mimic human performance."

With the aid of large gravitational N-body simulations, they will deduce what that matter distribution must have been earlier in cosmic history, before the galaxies began to form their stars. At those early times, normal matter in the form of gas would have been evenly mixed with the dark matter. The team will then use smooth-particle hydrodynamic simulations to follow the combined development of the dark matter and the gas, under various assumptions about how the gas is turned into stars, and how those stars feed energy back into the intergalactic gas. Their aims include testing a currently-popular model, according to which gas is shocked and heated as it falls into massive systems, but flows quietly into smaller galaxies, remaining cold so that it can readily form stars. They will estimate how much gas is associated with various cosmic environments, such as filaments and sheets of galaxies, and examine how metals produced by the nuclear reactions inside stars are fed into the intergalactic gas.<br/><br/>A graduate student will be trained by participating in the research, and the team also expects to offer small-scale research projects for undergraduates. The density fields derived from the SDSS catalog, and various catalogs from the simulations, will be made available to the astronomical community. The team will produce three-dimensional maps of the reconstructed distribution of dark matter, luminous galaxies and intergalactic gas, for use in teaching and public outreach."

For example, as far as random graphs are concerned, he will be focusing on the problem of finding sharp thresholds for the existence of factors in random graphs and hypergraphs, a special case of which is the sharp version of Shamir's conjecture on perfect matching in random hypergraphs. He will also study expansion in random lifts and the sandwiching conjecture concerning Erd\""os-R\'enyi random graphs and random regular graphs. For random matrices, he proposes to study many problems concerning random Bernoulli matrices, such as probability of singularity, distributions of determinants and permanents, and properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Several of these problems have strong connection to problems in theoretical computer science. The PI will also continue his study of structural theorems in additive combinatorics, in particular those which have strong links to other fields, such as number theory and probability.<br/><br/>For a long time, randomness has been used by scientists to model huge and difficult structures that occur in nature. One famous example is Wigner's use of the spectra of random matrices to model energy levels of atoms. Another is the use of random graphs to model real life graphs such as the Internet. The PI plan is to make a systematic study of random matrices and random graphs, together with some problems in number theory, which, quite surprisingly, have turned out to be related. He strongly believes that a systematic study of the proposed problems will eventually lead to the developments of new ideas and tools, which can be useful in many other topics, and to a deeper understanding of the relations between various fields of mathematics."

The proposed work focuses on experimental design of ill-posed inverse problems; a field that has not received sufficient attention in the inverse problems community where the focus is usually on the analysis of the inverse problem given the data. Obviously, this already imposes restrictions on the quality of the possible solutions. On the other hand, the objective of the funded work is the study of an important pre-data acquisition question: How should the experiment be conducted to obtain optimal data given the physical constraints and available resources? Solutions to this question require techniques from numerical optimization, statistics and inverse problem theory. In particular, the problem of experimental design can be cast as a bilevel optimization problem that consists of two nested optimization problems. The proposed work is a study of design criteria and new numerical algorithms for the solution of the bilevel optimization problems that arise from them.<br/><br/><br/>This work will address the fundamental question of experimental design of ill-posed inverse problems. Such problems arise in the design of any practical experiment or instrumentation from geophysical and medical imaging to the production of better vision systems. This work will develop new criteria for the design and development of new algorithms that will enable its numerical implementation. The results of the research will be applied to electromagnetic imaging, a field that is routinely used in geophysics and medical physics. <br/>It will lead to better experiments that yield better images and as such, will assist in the decision making of geoscientists and and physicians."

In particular, the principal investigators will examine whether adaptation to local climate limits the ability of ginseng to respond to climate change. A long-term (7 - 10 year), demographic dataset from across ginseng's natural range will be used to detect patterns of population response to climate variation, and form the basis for models that predict future population viability. Field and laboratory experiments will be used to test for local adaptation to climate. If populations of ginseng are adapted to local climate, then the directional temperature increases projected for the next century may negatively affect all populations throughout the range of this economically important plant.<br/><br/>American ginseng is the United States' premier wild-harvested medicinal plant species, generating important supplemental income for Appalachian families. Climate change threatens to negatively impact this valuable natural resource as well as other similar species. Developing models of population viability in response to climate change will ultimately serve as the foundation for effective conservation and management strategies in the context of global warming."

These inputs have beneficial effects including increased crop production, and deleterious effects such as nutrient pollution. Forest soils can serve as sinks and sources for reactive nitrogen. The identification of mechanisms that allow forest soils to retain this nitrogen is an important research goal. This research will improve our understanding of reactive nitrogen retention by incorporating soil carbon and soil texture into an analysis of forest soil nitrogen retention. Soil carbon can promote the transformation of reactive nitrogen into non-reactive forms. In contrast, coarse soil texture can promote the transportation of reactive nitrogen to surface and ground waters. The relative importance of these processes will be evaluated along gradients of soil carbon and soil texture in a Chesapeake Bay watershed. The results will be integrated to determine how nitrogen transformation and transportation interact to control ecosystem losses of reactive nitrogen. An improved understanding of the mechanisms promoting nitrogen retention can help to determine when, where and why reactive nitrogen is transported to surface and ground waters. Soil texture offers a broadly applicable framework for interpreting these relationships. <br/><br/>Because soil texture is well-mapped across the globe, results from this research will enable managers to use existing soil texture maps to predict places and times where open waters are particularly susceptible to non-point nutrient pollution and to manage landscapes accordingly. An undergraduate student will participate in this project, and high school students will benefit from educational materials developed from this research."

Much of the diversity of flowers may arise from their role in attracting pollen and/or pollinators. At the same time, flowers must also allow pollen to germinate and form a compatible pollen tube that carries sperm to egg. Although pollination has to occur before a pollen tube can grow, little is known about how evolutionary changes in pollinator attraction correlate with events that happen afterward from pollen tube growth to fertilization. This research uses natural- and hand-pollination experiments to describe fertilization biology in the water lilies (Nymphaeales), a group with diverse flowers and pollination mechanisms. Such data will then be used to correlate evolutionary changes in floral form with post-pollination biology. The specific goal of this award is to gather data from Trithuria (Hydatellaceae), a tiny and poorly understood Australasian plant that is remarkably different from other water lilies.<br/><br/>The water lilies represent an independent flowering plant lineage that diverged from the rest of angiosperms over 125 million years ago, and so evolutionary transitions in floral and fertilization biology within this lineage are of great interest to comparative biologists. This project has provided research opportunities for three undergraduates and one local educator, and will provide funding for two additional students to assist with fieldwork in Australia and lab work in the USA. It also facilitates collaboration between University of Tennessee and Western Australian researchers."

During this interval, a major cultural transition took place in the greater Bering Strait region that underlay the development and subsequent dispersal of the Iñupiat or Inuit peoples across much of the circumpolar world. The beach ridges of Cape Espenberg contain a sequence of occupations between AD 800 and 1400 and offer a wealth of paleoclimate data for the Kotzebue Sound region. <br/><br/>The research program will entail mapping, sampling, and limited excavation of former settlements on the beach ridges of Cape Espenberg by an international team of researchers (American, Canadian, and Russian) and student participants from local Alaska native communities. During Year 1 (2009), senior personnel will collect paleoenvironmental data and excavate several features on selected beach ridges. During Years 2-3 (2010-2011), senior personnel will work with student participants to expand the excavation of former houses and other features. Additional paleoenvironmental data will be gathered, and a comprehensive map of the Cape Espenberg settlements (initiated during a 2007 reconnaissance) will be completed. <br/><br/>The collection and analysis of archaeological and paleoclimatic data will be pursued within the framework of questions concerning the transition and subsequent development of human settlement at Cape Espenberg.

However, archeological discoveries indicate that humans had colonized areas south of the ice sheets prior to the end of the last Ice Age (c 11,000 years radiocarbon ago). Based on these data, PI E. James Dixon questions the predominant theory that the Bering Land Bridge and southward migration through central North America was the original route of human entry to the Americas. Dixon?s alternative hypothesis suggests that between 16,000 and 12,000 years ago humans using watercraft may have first entered the Americas by colonizing refugia and deglaciated areas of the continental shelf of the Northwest (NW) Coast of North America exposed by lower sea level. This research project challenges traditional thought regarding the origins of Native Americans, the nature of their original adaptation, and when and how they first colonized the Americas. Native American oral histories, recent discovery of artifacts on the ocean floor, and refined paleoenvironmental and geological data, make it possible to identify specific locales where ancient submerged sites may be located in SE Alaska. This research will analyze these data and employ Geographic Information Systems (GIS) modeling of LGM and post-LGM paleogeography to identify specific under water locales on the continental shelf of Southeast (SE) Alaska that exhibit high archeological potential. Identified site locales and select areas exhibiting high archeological potential will be surveyed and sampled using marine archeological techniques including multibeam side scan sonar and bottom sediment sampling in an effort to test the coastal migration hypothesis."

The PI intends to advance understanding of plastic deformation in non-crystalline solids to materials with increasing degrees of structural order. Non-crystalline solids find industrial application as metals, ceramics, semiconductors and polymers, but the fact of their disorder has discouraged the development of adequate theories for their deformation. Recently large-scale atomistic simulation has allowed dramatic progress in analyzing the structural disorder in these solids and in relating their mechanical properties to their structural evolution. In the process constitutive laws have been developed that use concepts from non-equilibrium statistical physics to connect macroscale behavior to atomic scale structure. These constitutive laws differ from existing relations insofar as they make reference to certain temperature-like intensive variables that quantify the structure. These structural parameters can be independently measured in simulation to validate the relations. Evidence of the success of these methods has been established by predictions of the mechanical response of metallic glass, an emerging structural material, both during homogeneous flow near the glass temperature and during the development of plastic localization at low temperatures. This research project will extend these investigations to include partially crystalline and nanocrystalline solids. Examining a continuum of structures over this range will test the generality of these theories of deformation for predicting plastic behavior in partially ordered solids. This will lead to a greatly increased understanding of deformation and failure in materials with varying degrees of disorder.<br/><br/>This computational and theoretical research program will be integrated with an educational program at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) that addresses a critical need to integrate computational methods into the Materials Science and Engineering core curriculum. This will be done in the context of courses on kinetics, phase transformations, mechanics of materials and physical properties of materials. The PI is continuing to develop a course on the graduate level covering computational materials science methods for molecular simulation.

When a small force is applied to a material, a material will bend or deform in such a way that the material will spring back to its original size and shape when the force is removed. As the force is increased, a point is reached where the material deforms and no longer springs back to original size and shape when the force is removed. The PI aims to understand how this plastic deformation occurs in a range of materials from metals that are a mosaic of tiny crystals the size of a few nanometers to amorphous metals where the atoms are not arranged in any apparent pattern. The PI aims to directly address issues critical to the development of emerging new materials with potential applications due to their high strength and hardness. By making a strong connection between the structure of the material and the resulting mechanical properties, these investigations will provide predictive theories that can be used to analyze the connection between processing, structure and properties and the onset of precursors to materials failure. These investigations will increase understanding beyond subject metals to other materials including glassy polymers, granular media, colloids and the processes that accompany friction.<br/>This computational and theoretical research program will be integrated with an educational program at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) that addresses a critical need to integrate computational methods into the Materials Science and Engineering core curriculum. This will be done in the context of more traditional courses on materials. The PI is continuing to develop a course on the graduate level covering computational materials science methods for molecular simulation. In addition the PI has a history of involving undergraduates in research. This project will involve both JHU undergrads and undergraduates recruited through the NSF MRSEC and PREM programs at JHU that bring in students from around the U.S. and majority-minority institutions."

The naturally occurring cellulose is a long chain polymeric molecule that is predominantly in semi-crystalline form. In the process of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose for the production of ethanol, the polymeric cellulose molecule is broken down into shorter fragments in the first stage. These fragments are further broken down by the action of enzymes to even shorter fragments leading to the disaccharide cellobiose and finally to the monosaccharide glucose; fermentation of these sugar molecules yields ethanol. The short fragments of cellulose that are formed in the initial stage have been suggested to be attached to the surface of the crystalline cellulose and it is hypothesized that this phenomenon slows down the overall rate of enzymatic hydrolysis process. The objective of this proposal is to determine the energetics of the process of separation of such cellulose fragments from the cellulose crystal surface. The fundamental understanding gained in this study will be useful in the long term for increasing the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and thus increasing the rate of ethanol production from cellulose. <br/><br/>The proposed work will consist of an approach that will combine molecular simulation studies with experiments performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Molecular simulations account for the detailed chemical interactions as well as the specific molecular structure of the system. These simulations will be used to characterize the molecular pathway of the process of separating the cello-oligomer fragments from the surface of a cellulose crystal and the energy required for this process. The simulation results will be validated against AFM measurements of the force required for separating cellulose fragments from the cellulose surface. A detailed mechanistic understanding of the process of cello-oligomer separation from a cellulose crystal surface will be developed in this work. <br/><br/>If successful, the fundamental knowledge gained in the proposed work will lead to new strategies for increasing the rate of enzyme hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass and hence the ability for economical production of ethanol from cellulose. This will have significant implications on removing the current, ever increasing dependence on fossil fuels. The proposed work will involve multidisciplinary research in the areas of interfacial thermodynamics, organic chemistry and alternate energy sources. The graduate students working on the project will receive interdisciplinary training in the techniques of molecular simulations, AFM measurements and chemical synthesis."

The vocal abilities of infants change dramatically over the first year of life.  Beginning with the earliest, immature vocalizations, infants make rapid progress, typically producing their first words by 12 months of age.  Along the way, they begin to produce speech-like syllables and to structure sequences of syllables in accordance with the phonological patterns of their language environment.  While the vocal achievements of the first year are well-described, not nearly as much is known about the mechanisms of change that drive vocal development. However, many studies of song learning in birds, as well as the investigators' preliminary studies, indicate that the social environment is a source of rich structure and feedback that can guide early vocal learning and development.  Can prelinguistic infants use social feedback to create new, more developmentally advanced vocalizations?  The investigators hypothesize that two processes enable social influences on vocal learning.  During the first 6 months, infants learn that their babbling reliably affects adults' behavior. From this early learning, infants become attuned to social responses to their vocalizing.  Over the next 6 months, infants use the contingent reactions of caregivers to their babbling to guide their vocalizations towards the phonological patterns of their language.  Acquiring knowledge of underlying patterns that govern the relations among multiple examples is a process known as statistical learning.  To investigate these processes of vocal learning, the form and timing of caregivers' reactions to their infants' sounds will be manipulated. First, the process of learning associations between babbling and caregivers' reactions will be investigated in 2- to 5-month-old infants.  Infants' information-processing capacities and caregivers' natural responsiveness to babbling will be used to predict individual differences in learning.  Second, the statistical properties and contingency of speech to 9-month-old infants will be manipulated to assess their effects on vocal learning.  The role of statistical learning in speech perception and production will be directly compared.  Finally, the relation between the two learning mechanisms (associative learning at 2 to 5 months and statistical learning at 9 months) will be determined. Findings from these studies will allow the investigators to construct a new theoretical framework for vocal development, integrating data from social learning and speech perception. The experiments will benefit from new applications of digital technologies that allow caregiver behavior to be manipulated in real-time (via instructions given over wireless headphones) during naturalistic interaction.  At the same time, changes in infants' vocalizations will be recorded and analyzed. <br/><br/>The proposed research has broad and fundamental implications for educating parents in providing optimal learning environments for their infants. An understanding of the role of socially guided learning in speech and language could be used to help caregivers to be more sensitive to infants' behavior in ways that would facilitate development. Investigating social influences on phonological development will contribute to the study of speech-language pathology and of processes underlying both successful and disordered communicative development.  This research will provide a framework for understanding the role of early social learning in communication and language deficits such as those seen in autism and Down's syndrome. By elucidating mechanisms by which infants learn from caregivers, these findings will be useful in designing behavioral interventions for infants with developmental disorders."

The PIs will focus on those areas with the greatest ice retreat, i.e., the northern Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, and Laptev Seas. Their method will be to build up to 10 relatively inexpensive ocean thermistor string buoys per year, to be deployed in the seasonally ice-free regions of the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic-ADOS (Autonomous Drifting Ocean Station) buoy will float at the ocean surface, equipped with (i) a sea level pressure sensor, (ii) a 50 m long string of 11 thermistors, and (iii) a high precision conductivity/temperature pair at 5 m depth on some buoys for thermistor calibration. Data will be recorded every 2 hours and downloaded in near real time via ARGOS satellite to the web site of the International Arctic Buoy Program (IABP). Daily average and vertically interpolated data (to 1 m bins) will also be provided on the IABP website, and will be sent to data archives (CADIS and NODC). The PIs will also work with scientists at mission-oriented agencies to better incorporate ocean surface data into their global products such as Sea Surface Temperature analyses. Real-time data will also be made available to the operational community via the Global Telecommunications System (GTS). Buoy deployment will use existing assets such as C130 aircraft coordinated by the National Ice Center (NIC), ship cruises planned as part of other projects, and springtime ice surveys conducted by other projects and/or by the U.S. Navy north of Alaska."

The physical environment, the presence of natural enemies, the genetic properties of a population and the abilities of individuals to adapt to the environment all influence population size and persistence. As ecosystems experience rapid climate change, it is imperative to understand how environmental and genetic variation affects the persistence of vulnerable populations. To focus on this critical problem, populations of a native willow beetle experiencing extreme climatic conditions in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California will be investigated. Populations studied for over a decade will be characterized using markers of genetic variation and environmental adaptation. Changes in population size will be related to these markers, to local topography, and to climatic conditions assessed by continuously recording weather loggers. Historical samples from these populations, some of which are now extinct, will be included in this analysis, offering a rare opportunity to analyze changes in populations for which the past environment is characterized. Experiments quantifying reproduction, larval survival, and adult over-wintering survival will assess potential mechanisms contributing to population persistence for beetles of differing genetic and environmental backgrounds.<br/><br/>Findings will provide unique insights into the ability of organisms to cope with and adapt to a rapidly changing environment, and will enhance understanding of the effects of genetic and environmental variation on ecological interactions among species. This project continues a unique, long-term population and climate dataset, and will thus provide a substantive contribution to knowledge of the effects of global climate change on natural systems.

It is composed of sensory organs located on the skin and in bony lateral line canals that are contained in a subset of bones in the skull. One of the four types of canals, widened canals, are quite sensitive to hydrodynamic stimuli and is considered to be an adaptation for the non-visual detection of prey, which is of great ecological importance for fishes. Two genera of Lake Malawi (Africa) cichlid fishes (Aulonocara [widened canals], and Tramitichromis [narrow canals]), will be used for a study that uses comparative anatomical, developmental and behavioral approaches to address fundamental issues in fish sensory biology. First, the convergent evolution of widened canals will be assessed among cichlids and among fishes more generally to more precisely define common features of its anatomy. Second, the pattern and timing of development of widened and narrow canals and the sensory organs contained within them will be analyzed quantitatively to determine the developmental basis for evolutionary change in the lateral line canal system. Finally, the role of widened canals in the detection of sand-dwelling prey will be analyzed using a behavioral assay and video analysis. This work will have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of feeding habits of cichlids in the African Rift Lakes, and of marine and freshwater fishes that feed on benthic prey, especially those in disturbed habitats in which non-visual predators may have an ecological advantage. <br/>The PI will integrate research and education by involving undergraduates and graduate students in all aspects of this project.

It is an exciting movement for the field of materials science to bridge more ideas into conception to provide solutions to new energy resources. This allows for interdisciplinary synergy to provide real-time solutions, while contributing to the fabric of science. Unique work permeates through each country concurrently with concern for depleting resources in fossil fuels and coal-dependence. As an example, in the United States, there has been a rapid surge to find solutions to the dependence on foreign oil, thereby expanding knowledge of fuel cells, batteries and alternative forms of harvesting energy. Solar cells and hydrogen fuel cells are just a few examples of areas of vast research. Work in designing renewable resources to produce devices for energy has matured alongside the concept of green and sustainable principles. Building new devices from materials for sustainable energy applications should also incorporate sustainable design thereby including green chemistry principles, to thus produce low waste, be less hazardous, and have the ability to break down into innocuous materials. This fellowship proposes to design and produce photocatalytic efficient devices to address the use of solar energy while incorporating sustainable design principles. Thereby using the process of electrospinning, a bottom-up approach to producing both nano and micronmeter scaled fiber mats can be fabricated. This fabrication development also creates new production pathways for materials for fuel cells and other energy-based devices. Direct electrospinning, as developed by the Principal Investigator (PI), is an approach, which minimizes processing time and steps in producing the designed and desired product. The overall goal of the PI is to utilize direct electrospinning as a method to incorporate chemical designed precursors to produce high-surface area, multi-layered materials for energy-based applications. It is proposed to form an interdisciplinary collaboration with both Professors Antonietti and Sanchez to combine their history of research, as individuals and together, of nano-scaled materials with structural hierarchy and green chemistry. Specifically, this is a 1-year project to direct electrospin a photocatalytic bilayer composite of anatase-TiO2 and TiOxNy. Studies will be performed to analyze the relationship between the precursor synthesis with direct electrospinning parameters, structural analysis of fiber formation, microstructure, composition, thermal properties and crystallization kinetics."

Best known for the primitive ape Proconsul and catarrhine primates Dendropithecus, Nyanzapithecus, and Limnopithecus, Rusinga/Mfwangano sites also preserve copious mammal, reptile, bird, and invertebrate fossils, as well as rarely seen fossil elements such as leaves, seeds, fruits, and insects. Thus, it becomes possible to reconstruct not just the anatomy of these primates, but also their chronological context, aspects of their feeding ecology, habitat preferences, and the broader ecological community in which they thrived. This project will undertake new research on Rusinga/Mfangano to further our knowledge of the chronology and paleoecology of stem catarrhines and hominoids. Specific objectives are to: 1) establish stratigraphic and chronological control within and among primate fossil sites on Rusinga and Mfangano; and 2) reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions throughout the geological sequence to assess the ecological parameters in which these primates lived. Work will be carried out over three summers and include basic stratigraphic analysis, absolute and relative dating, controlled fossil collection, analyses of stable isotopes, revisions of existing faunal collections, and dental microwear analysis. The intellectual merit of this project lies in combining geological, paleontological, and paleoecological methodologies to substantially advance our knowledge of hominoid evolution and adaptation through development of high-resolution chronostratigraphic data and detailed paleoecological models for Rusinga and Mfangano catarrhine primates. This project also has considerable broader impact in promoting education and cooperation at the local level, advancing local involvement in the preservation of the fossil heritage, employing local and national Kenyan workers, educating undergraduate and graduate students, and promoting international and interdisciplinary collaborations."

Essentially, a solution of ions flows through a highly porous conducting pair of electrodes and anions or other negatively charged species are removed at the positive electrode while cations or positively charged species are separated from solution at the negative electrode. During the removal process, energy is being stored in a capacitive fashion and is readily available to lower the cost of energy consumption. In a recharge cycle, a reverse bias is applied forcing the electrochemically-sequestered ions to be released as brine, much as in both RO and evaporative distillation processes. Brine production is generally considered to be less for CDI than in RO operations. <br/><br/>This proposal includes fundamental as well as practical studies of the CDI process using a novel asymmetric set of electrodes coated with nanoporous oxides. This research will utilize electrochemical impedance measurements and models tied to real-world pore size and pore size distributions to interpret our results. In addition, an insitu electrochemical FTIR system is to be developed to study molecular behavior inside these nanoporous oxide electrodes. From a practical perspective, many pairs of CDI electrodes must work in tandem, controlled electronically, and matched to water composition and flux for optimal ion removal. In this part of the proposed studies, a stack of electrodes will be assembled into a module and benchmarked with respect to ion removal versus time, electrode surface area, and energy cost per gallon of water processed. This portion of the proposed work will be completed in four parts: 1. Choosing an optimal supporting material for our electrodes 2. Coating this support with our best nanoporous oxide films. 3. Testing electrodes in four pair stacks and finally 4. Building a CDI prototype. <br/><br/>Potentially, CDI can compete favorably as a desalination process. The CDI system proposed could be used by municipal facilities or in third-world communities providing potable water to people in severe need. This project will result in the training of one PhD and several undergraduate research students. It will contribute to renewed laboratory instrumentation to be employed in both research and teaching. In addition, this project will be used in a modified fashion as a device template for an undergraduate introductory course in engineering taught at the University of Wisconsin each fall semester. In this class, 16 students, forming an engineering team will cooperate with Engineers Without Borders (EWB), to develop a solar-powered CDI system that EWB will field-test in Kenya."

The hypothesis being tested is that a reduction in the quantity and quality fat deposited by bats during the pre-hibernation period in autumn may compromise successful hibernation, and their ultimate reproductive success. White adipose tissue (WAT) is the primary source of energy that sustains bats (and other hibernators) throughout the winter when they have no access to food. Over-winter survival and subsequent reproductive success requires a sufficient quantity and quality of WAT deposited during the pre-hibernation period, and sufficient fat reserves to sustain deep torpor and periodic arousals throughout the winter, and a final arousal in spring. Because insectivorous bats cannot synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), deficiencies in dietary PUFAs during the pre-hibernation period in autumn may reduce the duration and depth of torpor during hibernation. Frequent arousals during hibernation may result in premature depletion of WAT before the end of the hibernation period. Moreover, depleted WAT at this time may contribute to a decrease in leptin production (necessary for ovulation and successful reproduction by females), or, in the worst cases, the inability to arouse from torpor or inability to mount an immune response to possible pathogens. <br/><br/>Analyses of body composition (including PUFAs) of bats of little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) during the pre-hibernation period will be conducted at sites affected by and unaffected by WNS to test three hypotheses that may help reveal or rule out causes of premature deaths or compromise reproductive success in these hibernating bats. Body composition analysis provides the most accurate and reliable estimates of total body water, WAT, and lean dry mass, and analyses of PUFAs in WAT collected from bats during the pre-hibernation fattening period. These data promise to provide valuable insight for testing proposed hypotheses to help explain why hibernating bats are dying prematurely at hibernacula in the northeastern US, and in turn suggest directions for future study to better understand WNS.<br/><br/> The proposed research will facilitate cross-disciplinary research between an ecologist, biochemical ecologist, and an endocrinologist to address an urgent environmental problem: unexpected mortality in hibernating insectivorous bats in the northeastern US. The proposed research will provide new insight into the mechanisms that influence winter survival and reproductive success in bats. Moreover, this research will provide an excellent opportunity to highlight the ecological and economic importance of bats in temperate ecosystems through print media, radio, TV, and web-based Internet blogs."

This phenomenon of volunteered geographic information (VGI) is part of a more general trend of user-generated content facilitated by a suite of technologies loosely known as Web 2.0. VGI presents significant new challenges for GIScience research, where existing theory and practices are geared almost exclusively toward more conventional forms of spatial data. Yet to date there exist no rigorous studies investigating the scientific and societal questions raised by this phenomenon. Little is known about why people contribute information, the accuracy or quality of what they produce, appropriate methods for synthesizing or analyzing these data, how the so-called ""digital divide"" may operate to inhibit some people from contributing VGI, or how this phenomenon may impact privacy and confidentiality. <br/><br/>Professors Goodchild (UC Santa Barbara), Elwood (University of Washington) and Sui (Texas A&M) will conduct a 3-year study that will expand basic knowledge about VGI via three overarching objectives. First, the PIs will conduct a comprehensive inventory of existing VGI efforts, and will assess the quality and accuracy of VGI using a sample of these websites. Second, the PIs will evaluate the methodological requirements of VGI with this same subset of VGI sources, evaluating the appropriateness of existing techniques such as spatial data mining and other approaches for analyzing large volumes of spatial data. Third, the PIs will study the social dimensions and impacts of VGI using a qualitative and case-based approach, collecting survey and interview data from applications in emergency management and community development, two important arenas in which VGI is predicted to be beneficial. Finally, to complement these basic and applied research activities, the PIs will establish and facilitate a network of scholars conducting research on VGI, to support compilation and exchange of their research activities, findings, methods, and curricular innovations. <br/><br/>This study makes several important contributions to science and society. It will identify factors that motivate and constrain people from contributing VGI, develop and evaluate techniques for synthesizing and assessing the quality and accuracy of VGI, and investigate the implications of VGI for privacy, confidentiality, and unequal access to digital information and technologies. VGI is thought to have tremendous societal benefits, for example by providing timely information from citizens about the impacts of a natural disaster or early warning of disease outbreaks. This research initiative will make a pivotal contribution toward realizing this potential, by developing basic and applied knowledge about how this new form of geographic information may be acquired, synthesized, and redistributed, and about how its quality may be assessed and assured. Geographic information is a substantial part of the infrastructure of sciences ranging from geophysics to anthropology, so VGI will impact science in novel and important ways. More broadly, VGI entails public participation in the production of geographic information and knowledge at an unprecedented level in human history - potentially six billion or more people could serve as information producers. VGI represents a radical departure from the top-down paradigm that has dominated the production of geographic information for the past few centuries. This project generates theoretical, methodological, and applied knowledge necessary for scientists, educators, policy makers, and citizens to engage this profound transition in productive ways."

NO is known to be involved in a large number of physiological events and in most of these cases, NO is released by one cell or tissue and then acts on another cell or tissue. The possibility that NO might also have physiological effects in the cell in which it is produced, however, has attracted very little attention so far. Novel preliminary evidence shows that NO can have important physiological roles within cells that produce it, such as regulating a variety of ion channels and determining the speed with which nerve cells grow. During neuronal development, the motile tips of advancing neuronal structures, called growth cones, guide extending nerve processes (such as axons and dendrites) to their appropriate targets by a process termed pathfinding. Expression of the Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) gene, which is responsible for the enzymatic production of NO, has been linked to the process of synapse formation and neuronal plasticity, making the neuronal growth cone a prime location for NO to act and effect pathfinding and synaptogenesis. Techniques used in this study include electrophysiology, molecular biology, cell culture and advanced imaging applications. The research proposed will provide the groundwork to refine our thinking about NO signaling in the brain and will serve as the basis to develop novel approaches to investigate brain development and repair. The proposed work combines research and educational components. It contains projects particularly suited for undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Several successful programs at Georgia State University serve as pipelines to enhance the representation of underrepresented ethnic minorities in research laboratories and in the scientific community as a whole."

Significant changes in the vision for LTER network science have taken place since the last renewal in 2003 and this proposal reflects those changes. The decadal plan for LTER, the result of an intensive three-year planning effort by the LTER network, describes a broad vision for LTER science that encompasses substantial new levels of synthesis and transdisciplinary research. The proposal includes support for continuing operations of the LNO to maintain the historical trajectory of LNO operations and LTER network functioning. Continuing operations include organization of two all scientists meetings in 2009 and 2012; basic cyberinfrastructure support for the LTER network; stewardship of network databases; continued development of the LTER network information system; information technology, database, and web consulting to LTER sites; facilitation of network governance meetings; development of a strategic communication plan; communication of information about LTER to a variety of audiences; and creation and maintenance of strategic partnerships. The proposal also outlines new approaches to assess and evaluate the outcomes of activities to help inform a flexible and responsive management strategy for the LNO. <br/><br/>The impact of the proposed work extends well beyond the bounds of LTER to include the broader social-ecological and informatics communities. The LNO is critical to the stimulation of the interdisciplinary interactions necessary to begin to address LTER decadal plan goals.

The International Integrated Microdata Series (IPUMS-International) is creating fundamental infrastructure for scientific research, education, and policy-making. The project has produced the world's largest population database, with information describing 263 million persons drawn from 111 censuses of 35 countries between 1960 and 2005. The next project phase will dramatically expand the geographic and chronological coverage of the database, continue to preserve data, and disseminate the data to users around the world. There are four major activities: <br/><br/> (1) Data acquisition and long-run preservation. The project will obtain and preserve the newest data from the 2010 round of censuses and the oldest data from the 1960s through the 1980s, most of which exist only on deteriorating magnetic tapes. <br/> (2) Data cleaning and processing. Before data can be released, it is necessary to draw samples, correct errors, apply confidentiality edits as needed, and make the data interoperable. <br/> (3) Documentation. Comprehensive documentation is essential to provide guidance to users on the meaning of census responses and their comparability across time and space. <br/> (4) Dissemination. The project will improve the web-based dissemination system, implement online data analysis and collaboration software, and conduct a program of education and dissemination activities. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Richly detailed population data spanning the globe over multiple decades are indispensable for creating the next generation of demographic, economic, and environmental models. IPUMS-International data have already stimulated new research that transcends national boundaries and static interpretation. To keep the database a cutting-edge source of information, the project will add the latest material from the 2010 census rounds, process data from additional countries, and recover data at risk of destruction. By doubling the scope of the database to 250 censuses the next project phase will leverage the NSF's previous investment and make IPUMS-International an even more powerful resource for understanding the causes and consequences of the sweeping transformations of the human population that are reshaping the planet. <br/><br/>This project will create a transnational resource of unprecedented power for understanding human society on a global scale. This infrastructure will multiply the quality, quantity, accessibility, and interoperability of information about the changing human population. By freely disseminating the data, the project will enhance scientific understanding of critical policy-related issues, such as population aging, international migration, climate change, and the effects of government programs on economic development and well-being. The project promotes teaching, training, and learning through three mechanisms. First, the project develops new tools for online data analysis for sharing curricular materials for teaching at all levels, bringing the excitement of discovery into the classroom. Second, it will conduct training workshops and develop online training modules to provide direct instruction in use of the data. Third, the project will employ a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate research assistants' including members of underrepresented groups'who will develop valuable new skills in a stimulating interdisciplinary environment"

Both of these areas are at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics. The research has 3 objectives:<br/>1.) Develop a consistent theoretical description of spin excitations in spatially anisotropic quantum antiferromagnets. This description will include both fractionalized high-energy spinons of one-dimensional chains as well as low-energy magnons of the weakly ordered ground state. Particular attention will be paid to a kinematic binding mechanism when a composite spin-1 pair, formed by two spin-1/2 spinons, lowers the energy via delocalization along the direction transverse to the chains. Effects of symmetry-lowering Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, thermal fluctuations, and external magnetic field will be included. The PI also aims to investigate the singlet sector of multi-spinon continuum which can be probed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, phonon-assisted optical absorption, and Raman scattering.<br/>2.) Determine the phase diagram of two families of spatially anisotropic triangular antiferromagnets. Both systems exhibit strong competition between collinear spin fluctuations, dimer ordering tendencies and classical spiral instability, but differ in the role that phonons play. Anisotropic response of this material to the applied magnetic field will be analyzed, and experimental properties of the field-induced ordered phases will be calculated by a combination of the renormalization group, chain mean-field theories and interacting spin waves and large-N Schwinger boson techniques. In addition, a careful analysis of symmetry lowering anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the quasi-one-dimensional geometry will be carried out.<br/>3.) Analyze spin-orbit induced instabilities of low-dimensional interacting electrons subject to significant structure inversion asymmetry as appropriate for various electrostatically confined and/or surface nanostructures. I will investigate the limit of strongly correlated electron Wigner crystal where spin-orbit effects are bound to dominate over exponentially weak exchange interaction.<br/><br/>Graduate students involved in the project will be trained in modern theoretical techniques such as bosonization, renormalization group, quantum field and many-body theories. The project will involve summer research opportunity for undergraduate students. Qualitative discussion of the research on the general physics level will be given during regular undergraduate physics seminars at the University of Utah. In addition, a web site with a graduate student level description of the outlined research topics and their interconnections will be developed in order to communicate results to a broader audience.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research and education at a frontier of condensed matter physics. The research is focused on understanding unusual magnetic properties revealed by experiments on recently discovered materials, for example herbertsmithite and volborthite.<br/>These materials have the necessary ingredients to become magnets, but do not exhibit magnetism. On the scale of atoms, there is a competition between the interactions that would favor aligning the fundamental building blocks of magnetism and the geometrical arrangements of the atoms. This frustrates the tendency to magnetic order. Experiments continue to deliver more examples, enabling the test of theoretical ideas that new states of matter will arise from failed magnetism. The discovery of new states of matter opens the door to new materials with desirable properties and new materials-related phenomena that may form the basis for future technologies or may solve existing problems.<br/><br/>The research will lay the foundations for understanding these materials and for future experiments that will better understand the unusual properties of these frustrated magnets. <br/><br/>Graduate students involved in the project will be trained in modern theoretical techniques of condensed matter physics. The project will involve summer research opportunity for undergraduate students.

Improvements to lineups developed by psychological scientists have benefitted the legal system. But, further improvements require a better understanding of the role played by secondary processes. Unlike the primary process (recognition memory) secondary processes are slow, effortful, deliberative, verbalizable, and largely insensitive to whether or not the culprit is in the lineup. These secondary processes include inferences, deductions, elimination processes, relative judgments, and other forms of reasoning. Secondary processes are hypothesized to be engaged when the primary process fails and can lead to disastrous affirmative identification decisions. Six experiments (total N=2400) are conducted in which people view a simulated crime and attempt an identification from either a culprit-present or a culprit-removed lineup. Each experiment is carefully designed to induce a failure of recognition in one-half of the conditions so as to study the engagement of secondary processes. Two experiments manipulate failure of the recognition experience at the level of memory acquisition (e.g., giving some of them a poor view of the witnessed event), two experiments manipulate failure of the recognition experience at the level of memory storage (e.g., manipulating the passage of time between viewing and the lineup), and two experiments manipulate the recognition experience at the level of memory retrieval (e.g., a grainy, low-resolution lineup task). The tendency of witnesses in culprit-removed lineup conditions to shift identifications to fillers (rather than making no identification) is predicted to be greatest in the conditions that induce recognition failure. In addition, the verbalizations of participant witnesses are studied to learn more about the nature of the secondary processes that map into these identification errors. The findings can help us develop better lineup procedures and better diagnose when mistaken identifications occur."

Sharks have been chosen to demonstrate how they navigate. While they can not detect a drop of blood a mile away, as often stated, sharks do have impressive prey tracking capabilities. Sharks are important in fisheries worldwide and have been severely depleted in recent decades, often taken as unwanted by-catch in other fisheries. Yet, they are essential top predators needed to maintaining a healthy ecosystem. This research project will show how sharks use all their senses in hunting behavior, starting with initial prey detection, through tracking and locating, and ending with striking their prey. For more complete understanding, we compare a few shark species that appear to use their senses differently mostly because they specialize in different prey in different habitats. A team of experts in sensory and shark biology, using unique testing facilities in Massachusetts and Florida, has been assembled including graduate students being trained in the many technical approaches needed for work on live sharks. The research directly involves undergraduate and high school students and provides extensive outreach to other students of all ages and to the public in general. The accumulated knowledge should lead to a model of shark navigation and predation that can be used for the conservation of sharks, protection of humans, and the engineering design of underwater steering algorithms. The inevitable presentation of this research in future television programs and video documentaries will disseminate new knowledge to the public at large, both of sharks and of rigorous science."

The proposed study builds on previous work by the PI, the successful History of Physicists in Industry project, which was completed in 2007 with support from NSF. In the earlier study identification was made of the increased use of corporate laboratories to assess technologies brought to the market by small startups, rather than to develop new technologies internally. The role of large corporations is now relatively well understood; this study seeks to further develop an understanding of entrepreneurial physics-based startups. It represents an effort to explore and develop documentation strategies that allow companies to identify and preserve historically valuable records and make them accessible to researchers in the future.<br/><br/>Physics entrepreneurship includes not just an organization founded by a PhD physicist, but also knowledge or intellectual property about the physical world and skills in working with manipulating the physical world that creates commercial value in the marketplace. The project seeks to uncover historical trends as well as current developments by interviewing physicists who founded or shared in the founding of some thirty-plus startups and other staff involved in the founding and/or research of these companies. Our interviews will include five startups prior to the 1990s that have since become established companies, five startups that failed during the dot-com boom, five startups subsequently acquired by larger corporations, and about fifteen currently developing startups founded since about 1990.<br/><br/>Some physicists have brought their understanding of the physical nature of the world to the creation and manufacture of new technologies. Others have focused on the creation and evaluation of intellectual property and its application across a broad spectrum of businesses, serving as consultants and licensors of intellectual property. And some physicist entrepreneurs develop high tech companies where the company itself is the product to be acquired by larger companies needing its intellectual property and skill sets. Interviews with PhD physicists who have founded or partnered in the founding of small hi-tech startups, as well as other research will facilitate understanding the changing dynamics of these operations from the perspective of the founders and their dynamic role in the intellectual property marketplace. At the completion of this project, eighty to ninety question set interviews including interviews with at least thirty founders of physics-based startups will have been acquired. The findings will eventually be published in professional journals and on the Web.<br/><br/>This study is important for understanding the role of startups in knowledge creation within industry and further investigating the changing patterns of research and development organizations and funding within the industrial community."

Previous research has found that the real-time use of grammatical constraints shows a remarkably uneven profile of successes and failures. Comprehenders show impressive facility in deploying some rather complex grammatical constraints, but they show striking inaccuracy in other cases that one might expect to be rather easy. This ""selective fallibility"" profile is unexpected under current theoretical models, and it presents an opportunity for new insights into how speakers store and manipulate sentence structures in memory. The project explores the hypothesis that the uneven profile reflects the different contributions of prospective and retrospective memory search processes. The project contrasts the predictions of two approaches to linguistic memory retrieval: one based upon structure-guided search and another based upon parallel cue-based retrieval in content-addressable memory. The project consists of six sets of studies on constraints such as subject-verb agreement, forwards and backwards coreference relations, bound variable anaphora, negative polarity item (NPI) licensing, and null subject licensing. The experiments use four experimental techniques (self-paced reading, event-related brain potentials (ERPs), speeded grammaticality judgments, and eye-tracking during reading). The project will gather data on the processing of English, Spanish, Hindi, and Brazilian Portuguese. It will also support a new collaboration with researchers in Brazil. <br/><br/>The project addresses a basic challenge to the integration of linguistics, psycholinguistics, and the cognitive neuroscience of language. It has been common to assume a clear division of labor between the mechanisms that speakers use to survive the pressures of real-time language processing, and another set of mechanisms that capture speakers' linguistic acceptability judgments. However, if it is possible to understand linguistic computation as real-time computation, then it becomes feasible to integrate the concerns of linguistics, psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience. The project supports broad-based training of students, including members of underrepresented minorities and undergraduate and high school students. The project will also create new international partnerships with teams of researchers in the UK, Germany, and Brazil, and will help to develop infrastructure for experimental research on Portuguese and the indigenous languages of Brazil. More broadly, by elucidating the detailed mechanisms used to encode and navigate structured representations in memory in healthy adults, the project will contribute to an understanding of normal and atypical language learning and age-related difficulties in language processing."

Questions such as ""What is the Universe made of?"" "" What are matter, energy, space and time?"" , which have now come to the forefront of research in experimental particle physics, observational cosmology and astrophysics, are tied together by remarkable developments on the theoretical front: An effective synthesis of previously disconnected areas of general relativity and cosmology, quantum gravity, quantum field theory, string theory and even pure mathematics.<br/><br/>The purpose of the group's proposed activity is to perform fundamental theoretical research at the crossroads of particle physics, quantum gravity, cosmology and string theory, with applications ranging from physics beyond the standard model, to the multiverse approach in cosmology, the interface of string theory and condensed matter, and the nature of space and time in quantum gravity. The PIs believe that their group is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the diversity in their expertise, tied together by the overlap in interests and focus on the same fundamental questions about the Universe.<br/><br/>Specifically, the PIs propose to take the following approach. Mina Aganagic is one of the leading experts in topological string theory. Her work will focus on applications of topological string methods and string dualities to novel mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking and in string phenomenology. She will further pursue the study of black hole entropy from the perspective of topological strings. Raphael Bousso has done seminal work on holography and geometric entropy bounds, co-discovered the landscape of string-theory vacua, and proposed a solution to the cosmological constant problem. He will work on challenges we face in extracting predictions from the landscape and the eternally inflating multiverse, such as the measure problem in eternal inflation, and replacing anthropic conditions by more general selection criteria. Petr Horava participated in a number of turning-point discoveries in string theory, such as orientifolds, D-branes, and M-theory. He will apply methods of nonequilibrium field theory to quantum gravity and string theory, study quantum gravity with anisotropic scaling, further develop the interface with condensed matter physics, and look for novel phenomena in low-dimensional models of string and M-theory. Yasunori Nomura has contributed significantly to our understanding of physics beyond the standard model; he pioneered grand unification in higher dimensions and proposed novel TeV scale theories. He will work on theoretical particle physics and cosmology relevant to experiments coming in the next decades, in particular the LHC, with emphasis on supersymmetry breaking and its mediation, the quark and lepton masses, and the implications of the multiverse on the TeV scale physics.<br/><br/>The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include training of students and postdocs who become the next generation of scientists of the nation as well as the world. Berkely Center for Theoretical Physics promotes diversity to encourage female and minority students and scientists. The fundamental questions addressed in this research are of deep interest to the general public, and the PIs will continue promoting the importance and excitement of fundamental science in the broader context of our society. The PIs will work with QuarkNet teachers to convey the essence of cutting-edge scientific discoveries to high school students, and will continue making themselves available as resources. They will work to enhance the award-winning Particle Adventure website on physics beyond the standard model and string theory. They will continue to disseminate the results of the current scientific research to under-privileged areas of the world via lecture series and educational activities such as Summer schools."

In all languages, pitch (as one aspect of speech prosody) can express attitude or emotion. In some languages, like English, pitch patterns, usually called intonation contours, also express distinctions such as that between a question and a statement. In languages like Mandarin Chinese, on the other hand, pitch patterns called tones go still further to signal differences between words that are otherwise identical. Despite significant advances in recent decades, a unified theoretical account of the linguistic phenomena called tone and intonation remains elusive in crucial respects. In fact, there is still no universal agreement even over how best to characterize the formal properties of intonation contours in languages like English. What seems to be missing is a common acoustic or articulatory vocabulary for the expression of the relevant distinctions, a single measurable dimension within which contours can be reliably distinguished regardless of the language under investigation. This project develops a new mathematical approach, based on the notion of Tonal Center of Gravity, to characterizing pitch distinctions in English. This approach reconciles seemingly contradictory results from the experimental literature on the perception of contrasting pitch contours. Our research will concentrate on a small number of intonation contours from English, and will test the applicability of our model in two kinds of experiments. The first involves automatic classification of pitch contours recorded from native speakers in an experimental setting. The second involves direct manipulation through speech synthesis of a number of the physical characteristics of pitch contours that might be involved in conveying speakers' intentions, to see which variables have the greatest effect on listeners' judgments of utterance meaning.<br/><br/>The project lays the groundwork for a unified approach to the production and perception of tonal contrasts in human language, one that expresses how systems differ, while capturing the deeper commonality among languages at the same time. The results of this work will also have a broader impact in the area of speech technology. For example, identifying the perceptually relevant characteristics of distinct intonation patterns will allow for greater realism in speech synthesis systems. In addition, being able to distinguish automatically between similar but perceptually distinct contours will allow automatic pronunciation training systems to give more helpful feedback to second language learners. Finally, this new model will facilitate automatic categorization of intonation contours for speech understanding systems. Progress in this area will ultimately allow such systems to derive meaning not just from the sequence of words in an utterance, but from the subtle meaning differences conveyed by intonation as well."

It remains largely unknown how these stem cell niches are first established in the early embryo. The proposed research will analyze the role of HAN, a predicted regulator of gene activity, in positioning the root stem cell niche. Preliminary work, largely by the methods of genetics and molecular biology, reveals that HAN determines the position of an instructive boundary between two different cell types, termed the ""proembryo boundary"". Signaling across this boundary, which is set up when the embryo has only eight cells, subsequently organizes the root stem cell niche.<br/>A comprehensive approach, including standard genetic and molecular biology techniques, genomics, microscopy, and biochemistry, will be followed with the aim to mechanistically understand how the proembryo boundary is established and regulated. Special emphasis will be placed on analyzing the role of HAN and closely related HAN-like factors this process.

Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) offers the promise of a sustainable, non-disruptive and energy efficient engineering solution to a variety of important infrastructure development and geologic hazard mitigation problems, including remediation of liquefaction potential, improving foundation bearing capacity, and reducing (or even eliminating) excavation and tunnel support requirements. MICP through ureolysis is being investigated by several research groups in the U.S. and abroad. However, denitrification is potentially superior to ureolysis as a MICP process in that denitrifying bacteria are ubiquitous in the subsurface and the process works under anaerobic conditions, e.g. below the water table, while ureolysis requires oxygenation. Denitrifying bacteria and nutrients will be introduced into a laboratory soil column with pore water containing calcium carbonate in solution. Carbonate precipitation will be monitored by mass balance measurement of calcium concentrations in the pore fluid and the development of cementation will be monitored by shear wave velocity measurements in the soil column. These column experiments will be used to refine a biogeochemical model for denitrification, establish an optimal nutrient mix for denitrification, and establish precipitation and cementation rates for MICP by denitrification. Triaxial and simple shear tests on specimens from the column experiments will be used to evaluate the relationship between the amount of MICP and changes in the strength, stiffness, and liquefaction potential of the specimens. The proposed research has the potential to transform geotechnical practice, not only by development of a new, sustainable approach to ground improvement but also by advancing the emerging field of biogeotechnical engineering.

The goal is to enable rapid computer-controlled fabrication of patterned biosensor coupons in a bench top or field environment. This will enable the small scale ad hoc fabrication of multi-capture reagent biosensor coupons capable of parallel detection of a variety of pathogens."

While choice is generally seen as universally impactful, recent cross-cultural comparisons reveal that the powerful motivational effects of choice may be limited to middle class European American groups of people. In other words, choice and its effects on behavior are intimately tied to an individualistic cultural perspective. This research project explores the role of choice in self processes, especially with respect to a sense of agency, and the nature and consequences of choice in three cultural contexts -- middle class European American, middle class Indian and working class European American. Fourteen studies will examine several key ideas. First, in middle class European American contexts, choice impacts self expression and feelings of agency, which benefits performance on cognitive and physical tasks but negatively affects interpersonal relations. Second, in middle class Indian contexts, self restraint rather than self expression via choice is associated with agency and benefits individual performance. And third, in working class European American contexts, social solidarity rather than self expression (again, via choice) is related to agency and benefits performance. Thus, choice is not equally powerful for everyone and has some negative consequences even for those who are most likely to reap its rewards. <br/><br/>The theoretical significance of this project rests, in part, on refining and enriching previous understandings of sociocultural effects and not, as is often the case, on introducing a novel dimension of cultural variation. Moreover, of both theoretical and practical significance is that the research seeks to show that while choice can be effective in motivating behavior, its impact depends on the specific sociocultural contexts with which people engage. That is, effectively motivating people to stop smoking, to vote, or to save energy resources depends on invoking socioculturally matched models of agency. Overall, then, this research promises to more fully explicate the choice by embedding it in sociocultural contexts and thereby contribute to policy makers' efforts in designing interventions that benefit communities."

The measurements will greatly advance our ability to predict the conditions under which magmas will rise buoyantly to the Earth's surface and erupt as lavas or form volcanoes. The measurements will also reveal the conditions and depths where magmas are too dense to rise to the surface, remaining either trapped by neutral buoyancy, or sinking further into our planet's deep interior. The experimental data will also provide new insight into the way in which the Earth was differentiated into crust, mantle, and core during its primordial formation stage. The collaborative effort combines experimental techniques that span the entire range of pressure and temperature conditions that exist for melting and magma production in the Earth. The highest pressures, simulating the deepest regions of Earth's mantle, will be done under dynamic compression at the Caltech Shockwave Laboratory, the intermediate pressures will be carried out under static compression in large presses at the University of New Mexico's High Pressure Laboratory, and the near-surface magmatic conditions will be studied in high temperature furnaces with ultrasonic techniques at the University of Michigan's Experimental Petrology Laboratory. <br/><br/>The new data will lead to the development of an empirically-based equation of state and a model for multicomponent silicate melts. This model should allow precise characterization of the locations of crystal/melt density crossovers in the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle, and D"" layer. This equation of state will be used in models of differentiation of a whole-mantle magma ocean or in defining the chemistry and dynamics of possible silicate melting at the modern core-mantle boundary. The investigators expect that the data will also provide the essential basis for development of next-generation melt models that encompass explicit speciation and/or non-ideal mixing terms. The data gathered under this proposal will be a precious resource for all future studies of melt properties and igneous differentiation at high pressure. Never before have such a wide range of techniques been applied to a common set of samples; together the complementary data sets will significantly enhance our understanding of magma physics within our planet."

Some defects are required by certain topologies such as the sphere and others form to lower the total energy of the system. Defect regions are natural places for biological activity, chemical linking, unusual elastic response and aggregation of disorder. This project will develop a thorough understanding of the preferred types of defect configurations for crystalline, hexatic, vector and nematic order on a variety of curved surfaces. This will pave the way for the first-principles design of entire libraries of mesoscale components (mesoatoms) that could serve as the building blocks of novel mesomolecules or bulk materials via self-assembly or controlled fabrication.<br/>A suite of tools from the fields of geometry, topology, statistical mechanics and computational science will be employed in this investigation which will be closely coupled with experimental groups. <br/><br/>The techniques and tools developed in the course of the proposed research, including methods of analysis, simulation applets, and databases, would be made freely available to researchers across disciplines.<br/><br/>The PI plans to involve undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates in his research program.

The PI will study how particles organize themselves on curved surfaces and at the interfaces between two materials or media. For example, experiment has been able to place small particles with an electrostatic charge on the spherical surface of a water droplet suspended in oil. The particles attempt to organize themselves in a regular geometric pattern. But because they are on a sphere rather than a flat surface, ?scars? form where the ordered array on one side does not match up with that on the other. As shown by the PI, theory is at least able to make useful predictions about features of the self-organized system. The PI will study a wider variety of systems with an aim to understand the ?scars? or defects in ordering that emerge and how geometry might be used to control how particles self-assemble into desired structures. The structure of the protein coat on a virus is another example of interest to the PI. In this case, molecules might preferentially bind to areas where there are defects on curved surface of the virus protein coat suggesting strategies for drug development. The general challenging problem of how interacting particles arrange themselves on curved surfaces has been of general interest in the field of mathematics. <br/><br/>The techniques and tools developed in the course of the proposed research, including methods of analysis, simulation applets, and databases, would be made freely available to researchers across disciplines.<br/><br/>The PI plans to involve undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates in his research program.

While the idea of fluid-optical devices can be traced back as far as the liquid mirror telescopes of the 18th century, microfluidics presents a unique opportunity for creating microscale analogues of these early devices. A series of fundamental studies will develop a new form of microfluidic transport exploiting the electromagnetic energy in photonic devices to capture, transport and separate particles. Additionally, the PI will create a new class of reconfigurable photonic system of microfluidic devices to transport, switch and modify light. These efforts require numerical/analytical modeling examining the coupling between hydrodynamics and electromagnetics, an experimental aspect to verify these models, and an implementation focus aimed at providing a ""proof-of-concept"" demonstration of a practical technology. <br/> <br/>Optical force transport has several advantages over other microscale techniques (e.g. electrophoresis, dielectrophoresis, and pressure) including opposite transport scaling laws, significantly higher separation resolutions and insensitivity to surface/solution conditions. By exploiting waveguides to deliver the electromagnetic energy, the PI shows that the fundamental limitation preventing widespread adoption of optical transport in microfluidic devices can be solved. A technology development thrust will also be pursued for a waveguide-based separation device for viral identification. This second thrust will develop a largely new application area for microfluidics and a new approach to reconfigurable photonics based on transport of electromagnetic energy within microfluidic streams, exploiting the same handling techniques developed for transporting chemical samples on-chip to shuttle light around. <br/> <br/>The PI plans development of a web-deployed ""FluidicsWiki"" organized around the central theme of micro and nanofluidics to allow user-edited content and thus the site can dynamically evolve with the field. The overall goal is to synchronously disseminate both summaries of recent research and educational tutorial content from and to the entire community. A planned series of academic and community outreach activities include organizing a biennial conference on optofluidics, conducting seminars on microfluidic technology for K-12 teachers, and explaining the benefits of nanotechnology to the public at the New York State Fair."

Changes in regional hydroclimate will exacerbate threats to sustainable water supplies from growing populations, pollution, declining infrastructure, and resource conflicts. One robust prediction of the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate model ensemble is that precipitation rates will decrease over Guatemala and most parts of Central America in both the summer and winter under future increased greenhouse gas scenarios. Critical to mitigating the consequences of changes in water availability is a long-term perspective on the potential range of variability in precipitation and the integration of this knowledge within water planning and natural resources policy. However, long-term instrumental records of drought are sparse in Guatemala and throughout the Central American tropics. This is particularly true for high elevation regions, which are likely to demonstrate the earliest and more severe local consequences of global climate change. In the absence of long instrumental records, scientists investigating the causes and consequences of climate variability and change depend on proxy records that can be used to reconstruct past ocean-atmosphere conditions. Tree-ring chronologies form the bulk of the available, high-resolution terrestrial proxy records. However, they are almost entirely absent from the tropical Americas south of Mexico. The lack of a high resolution, long-term perspective on drought from this region also limits opportunities to validate climate model predictions. The development of long, annually resolved records of climate from this region is therefore necessary for understanding the local response to broad-scale forcing, detecting and attributing long-term trends related to anthropogenic climate change, and verifying the fidelity of the climate models used as the primary forecasting tool for predicting future change.<br/><br/>The investigators will expand the geographic frontier of dendroclimatology into the mountains of Guatemala, identifying species and sites which show sensitivity to precipitation, and developing estimates of drought variability over the last several centuries. They will investigate and utilize a combination of high elevation tropical conifer species in this study. All candidate taxa will be carefully and systematically examined to establish annual ring formation and chronology development. Once dating and chronology development has been completed and verified, the tree-ring time series will be compared against the available local and gridded meteorological data in order to detect physiologically reasonable climate/growth relationships. Models will be developed to estimate past climate anomalies from the absolutely dated ring width series. Reconstructions of past precipitation and drought will be objectively compared against independently developed climate fields as well as estimates of past forcing. The drought reconstructions will also be used to interpret the possible role of climate in important historical events of the last several hundred years. This research will provide a long-term context for drought variability that is critical for efforts to mitigate the consequences for vulnerable human populations from climatic change. Active outreach and participatory education in Maya communities in the regions are integrated in the proposed research."

Existing engineering models simply fit the open circuit voltage empirically and postulate dynamics by linear diffusion of intercalated lithium, but recent experiments contradict this picture for phase-separating materials. In contrast, the team will develop robust mathematical models to predict the voltage and current response over the full range of operating conditions. The basis for modeling at the single-crystal level will be Cahn-Hilliard partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, expressing chemical-potential dependent reaction reactions. The goal will be to provide the first mathematical description of emerging high-rate materials, where phase transformations occur via nonlinear intercalation waves, coupling anisotropic diffusion and electrochemical reactions. This effort will also raise basic mathematical questions in linear and nonlinear stability, degenerate wave solutions, and numerical methods.<br/><br/>In spite of extensive engineering over the past few decades, the performance of rechargeable batteries has improved only incrementally. Power density (charge/discharge rate per unit mass) and cycle life must still improve drastically for applications such as electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, and this will require a better fundamental understanding of how ions are inserted and extracted from porous electrodes. To meet this need, the project creates a Focused Research Group from mathematics, chemical engineering, and materials science to develop a new theoretical paradigm for Li-ion batteries. The group will guide the engineering of new ultrafast Li-ion batteries, capable of charging and discharging in seconds rather than hours, while opening fruitful directions for applied mathematics. The group will train graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs, organize annual workshops, and develop a course on mathematical modeling of electrochemical energy systems."

Kaifer at the University of Miami, who will study the relationship and interplay between molecular structures and electron transfer reactions. This proposal is aimed at elucidating fundamental questions related to electron transfer (ET) reactions and how the ET rates are affected by a host in supramolecular systems. This is a major continuing effort of previous work to better understand electron transfer reactions that occur within noncovalent encapsulated redox centers. By using a redox active guest and a suitable host, the resulting inclusion complex is a structure in which the redox center is partially or completely encapsulated by the host cavity. It may be viewed as analogous to biological host-guest macromolecular systems. These experiments will seek to understand quantitative and qualitative changes in reactivity of encapsulated molecules, such as reorganization energy rates and related thermodynamic parameters. Specific objectives are to i) investigate ferrocene and its derivatives in various cucurbit[n]uril (CBn) and cavitand hosts via noncovalent binding interactions, ii) investigate mediated electron transfer between fully encapsulated ferrocence centers and electrode surfaces, iii) continue binding property studies of CBn hosts within a range of inclusion complexes, and iv) begin new research on the use of nitroxide spin labels to probe the interior space of molecular capsules to better understand the complex factors controlling self-assembly. Since CBn hosts surpass cyclodextrins, a similar class of cyclical-shaped oligosaccharides, in binding affinity and selectivity, these studies will generate meaningful information to better understand supramolecular assembly and molecular recognition of a valuable class of molecules. <br/><br/>Cucurbiturils are efficient host molecules in molecular recognition and may find applications as supramolecular catalysts, drug delivery vehicles, play a role in information storage devices, or other materials science applications. Professor Kaifer will continue to actively engage women and underrepresented minorities from high school to post-doctoral levels in his research program. In addition to the excellent research being carried out, Professor Kaifer emphasizes student training beyond the boundaries of the traditional disciplines of chemistry. All group members are required to develop synthetic expertise and must perform their own electrochemical and spectroscopic experiments to characterize the electron transfer reactions, host-guest binding interactions, self-assembly and/or aggregation processes in which their target compounds may engage. The PI?s group has always bestowed a friendly and nurturing atmosphere for the development and training of underrepresented minorities as researchers. Several research components of this application are specifically designed for undergraduate students, since their research work often suffers from schedule limitations that do not affect graduate students and postdoctoral associates. In terms of measurable outcomes in minority training, Professor Kaifer makes the commitment that the research participants in this project will include: (a) a minority/female undergraduate every year, (b) a minority/female high school student every year, and (b) at least a minority/female postdoctoral associate or graduate student during the grant cycle."

The signaling components that link the perception of blue light to the stomatal opening response are largely unknown, and hypersensitive to red and blue (hrb) mutants are of particular interest. The hrb mutants were initially isolated for their short hypocotyl phenotype under red and blue light. Interestingly, the blue light-induced stomatal opening response is also impaired in the hrb mutants, and the mutant plants are more resistant to dehydration and show reduced water loss and stomatal aperture. The strong stomatal phenotype of the hrb mutants may be due to impairment in both red and blue light signaling since red light often enhances blue light responses. The HRB1 gene has been molecularly cloned and encodes a nuclear ZZ-type zinc finger protein. HRB1 physically interacts with phosphatase 7 (or PP7), a nuclear serine/threonine phosphatase and a positive regulator of blue light signaling, through its ZZ-type zinc finger domain. The goal of this project is to understand the roles of HRBs in blue light regulation of stomatal aperture. How HRB1 functions within the phototropin and cryptochrome signaling pathways and the function of HRB1 in hrb2 and hrb3 backgrounds will be investigated. How HRB1 and PP7 interact in vivo and genetically and the nature of their interaction will also be thoroughly studied.<br/>Broader Impacts: This research will provide excellent opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to gain significant research experiences, and most importantly, to develop their ability to critically analyze and solve scientific problems. A diverse group of undergraduates including African American and Hispanic students have conducted research in this lab in the past. Six of the 13 undergraduates are minorities from a campus-wide life science summer undergraduate research program. The students are recruited throughout the country, spend 10 weeks on the campus, participate in major research projects and a weekly seminar series, and present their research results to their peers and mentors at a concluding symposium. In specific aim I of this project, a specific training plan was outlined for the undergraduates, ranging from physiological, genetic, to molecular studies. On an even broader level, this project will open new possibilities to engineering stomatal activity and help plants to survive desiccation. The stomatal aperture is also regulated by other environmental cues such as drought in addition to blue light. Given that hrb plants may still respond to ABA, a well-known drought signal, these plants should enjoy the advantages of both constitutive and induced protection under water-limiting conditions."

Furthermore, phage genes and the<br/>proteins they encode are the outcome of evolution over eons, the products of which we<br/>would be able to exploit if only we could decode the information in the phage DNA<br/>sequences. The number of available phage genome sequences is increasing rapidly; on<br/>the other hand, they represent the largest global reservoir of uncharacterized genetic<br/>material.

Recent observations of decadal oxygen changes of in the upper ocean, which now have been documented in every ocean basin, motivate several questions regarding the underlying mechanisms. How does dissolved oxygen respond to atmospheric forcing at different time scales? How do the temporal spectrum and spatial patterns relate to that of its driving forces, both physical and biological, and to the coupling between them? Modeling studies on long-term trends and basin-scale variability revealed that dissolved oxygen is highly sensitive to both physical and biological processes, and it has been suggested as a tracer of climate change in the oceans. However, mechanistic understanding of underlying causes are far from complete, and fuller elucidation of the large-scale modes of oxygen variability is therefore needed, particularly as new data is rapidly increasing. <br/><br/>The research team hypothesizes that the physical and biological drivers of oxygen changes are modulated by the thermocline ventilation in the upper ocean, leading to enhanced large-scale, low frequency variability. The theory leads to novel hypotheses for explaining two recurring and general observations: that O2 changes are so prevalent at decadal time scales and are focused in waters occupying a common position in the water column, namely the base of the ventilated thermocline. They plan to evaluate these predictions using a hierarchy of models ranging from a one-dimensional isopycnal model to a state-of-the-art eddy-permitting global ocean model with ecosystem and biogeochemistry components. The work plan will involve comparison of patterns across a hierarchy of models, illuminating fundamental and non-model dependent dynamics of the oceanic oxygen cycle. This project culminates in the application of our theoretical and modeling approach to the Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) for the proposed global implementation of ARGO-O2 project to develop future observational strategies. This will be a major step toward building a set of tools for understanding the types of O2 variability found in the real world, and laying the groundwork for analyzing a wide range of observational and modeling data for this important tracer. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The researchers anticipate that this work will shed light on hypoxia as an emerging problem in the ocean of strategic importance to fisheries managers and marine conservation efforts. Through the proposed OSSEs, this project will assist in the formulation of optimal observational strategies for the international efforts to develop the global array of O2 sensors on ARGO floats. The results are also expected to provide a mechanistic basis for estimating global scale losses of O2 from such irregular sampling networks, thus reducing a key uncertainty in the quantification of the partitioning of anthropogenic CO2 uptake between the land and the oceans. Finally, the project will provide for the training and support of two beginning graduate students, as well as outreach activities at Coloado Statue University on oceans and climate science for K-12 through graduate students and for the general public."

The project hopes to address some of the fundamental problems of using near-natural amino acids as probes for protein structure and function. The approach, if successful, can provide a general tool for inserting near-natural amino acids specifically into proteins of interest. The goals of this study are to understand the H-bonding network of glutathione-S-transferase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), and the catalytic mechanism of choline oxidase.<br/><br/>This award by the Chemistry Division and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences provides support for a unique and cross-disciplinary combination of skills between Professors Cropp and Dieters that involve protein engineering and synthetic chemistry, which will offer fantastic training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at both schools. The interactions between students from the two groups will be electronically assisted by the use of a dedicated Wiki-based website. To engage the general public, the Cropp and Deiters labs will invite high school teachers to conduct summer research on near-natural amino acid mutagenesis. The information gained from working with non-scientists on this research will be used to implement near-natural amino acid mutagenesis experiments in an upper-level undergraduate course. In addition, the developed research tools will benefit, and be disseminated to, enzymologists and protein chemists. Most importantly, these tools can be applied in any laboratory with standard Molecular Biology equipment and expertise, and thus will have a significant impact on the understanding of enzyme mechanisms, not possible with any other methods. From an applied perspective, some of the amino acids created in this work may expand protein function giving rise to better and more stable catalysts."

In curved channels, sediment interacts with highly three-dimensional flow and induces point bars and meandering planform evolution. To date, no theory is able to satisfactorily explain and quantify the interactions among flow (mean and turbulence), sediment transport by size fractions, point bar dynamics and the sequential migration of bends. Among many numerical models applied to curved and meandering channels, formulations for sediment transport by size fractions have been based on data from straight laboratory flumes and never tested with sinuous channels. Current understanding of sediment sorting through meandering channels limits the capability of numerical models in simulating the evolution of bed material gradation, bed morphology, and bend planform. Towards a complete understanding of sediment transport in meanders, this project aims to address the following questions: How does flow influence sediment transport? How much does sediment transport deviate from the near-bed mean flow? What are the spatial distributions of sediment load? What are the size gradations of bed load, surface, and substrate material? How do they correlate to sediment transport rate by size fraction? How does spatially varied sediment flux constitute point bar dynamics? How does meandering migration response to the growth or dampening of point bars?<br/><br/>Experiments will be conducted in several series of self-formed meandering channels with sinuosities ranging from 1.25 to 3.7. Well-graded sediment mixtures will be fed into these sinuous channels to enable investigation of three-dimensional hydrodynamic flow field, distributions of surface and substrate material, sediment transport characteristics for different size fractions at the streamwise and lateral directions, gradual formation, growth, and dampening of point bars and pools near the apex and channel crossing, planform evolution as bank erodes and point bar progresses. The experimental results will be integrated into a numerical model to simulate the processes of meandering migrations in both experimental flumes and a natural river. <br/><br/>The results of this research will contribute to scientific understanding of river meanders and provide valuable guidance in river restoration design. The merit is not only in basic research but also in engineering practice. The project will acquire an experimental facility and a computer model needed for new courses, engage undergraduates in research, establish a longer-standing mentoring program for women students, develop a computer animation exhibition for science museums, and outreach to high school students. The objectives are to encourage creativity and innovation, stress computing in engineering teaching, increase the visibility of women in engineering, and attract most talented high school graduates to Civil Engineering."

To the widely recognized social and economic consequences of post-World War II urban restructuring--rising income inequality, hyper-segregation, gentrification, and uneven redevelopment--this study adds environmental consequences, which require a new method of longitudinal data collection and analysis. The study's goal is to develop,<br/>demonstrate, and refine such a methodology in order to bring environmental changes in urban lands center stage and, in the process, improve understanding of urbanization as a critical and ongoing link between society, nature, and the human condition. This new methodology will extend beyond traditional concerns with political economic and socio-spatial processes to incorporate environmental concerns of known scientific importance: the accumulation and distribution of ""relict industrial waste,"" that is, environmental hazards produced in earlier eras that have become hidden with time and may still pose significant health risks. Examining these dynamics requires a new approach?one that begins in the past, with parcels formerly occupied by hazardous industry, and proceeds to the present to examine what these sites have become, when, and where. Three propositions frame this effort, each subject to empirical investigation and refinement: 1) Prior to increasing environmental awareness and regulation of the 1980s, hundreds of thousands of manufacturers came and went in U.S. cities, dumping hazardous waste on site; 2) Many of these sites have now converted to other uses, effectively hiding relict waste from public view, government regulation, and scholarly inquiry; 3) How and where these changes in urban lands have occurred--first through manufacturing and onsite waste disposal, then through site conversion--depend greatly on social and economic processes happening around them, over time.<br/><br/>Regarding broader impacts, results from the study have the potential to transform how sociologists study cities in ways that not only enrich sociology but build bridges to related fields of environmental history, geography and regional sciences, science and technology studies, and public health. These contributions can offer important theoretical advances for understanding urban-environmental change, inform regulatory mandates involving environmental justice, and offer comparative insights that can help scholars and policymakers distinguish general from place-specific processes of industrial production, land use conversion, and environmental inequality."

Identical twins often have nearly indistinguishable facial features, and related individuals show notable familial resemblances. Persons affected with particular Mendelian conditions have consistently distinctive facial features. Human facial features also exhibit extensive normal variation throughout the world. Anthropologists have long been able to use morphometric measures to quantify this variation, finding many similarities within and differences among populations from around the world. <br/><br/>While much is known about morphological variation in facial features among populations, the underlying genes that are responsible for these traits have yet to be identified. Abundant evidence suggests that some alleles have strong phenotypic effects on facial morphology, but very little is currently known about these genes. The aim of this project is to investigate the relationships among morphological variation of the face, genetic ancestry and candidate genes in a sample of admixed individuals. Through a process known as admixture mapping, it is possible to identify genes for traits which vary between the parental populations that contributed to the admixed population. To accomplish this, facial variation will be quantified from three-dimensional images using several morphometric methods and genetic variation will be measured via a panel of ancestry-informative markers. A list of candidate genes will be identified from the literature and tested for signatures of non-neutral evolution. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these candidate genes will be tested for effects on facial variation while controlling for genetic stratification resulting from admixture. The results of these analyses will be the identification of some of the first genes involved in normal variation in facial morphology. <br/><br/>Given the evolutionary and anthropological significance of the human face, understanding normal variation in human facial features is an important direction for future genetic exploration. Finding genes involved in facial variation can and should provide new insights into our understanding of modern human variation and presents a new avenue for investigating the evolution of human facial variation."

Prochlorococcus carries out the first step of carbon dioxide fixation in a specialized organelle called the carboxysome. Carboxysomes are self-assembling metabolic modules, composed entirely of protein. Although the polyhedral shape of carboxysomes has been well documented by electron microscopy, their protein composition is known for only a few non-photosynthetic model organisms. Structural studies that address the relationship between carboxysome architecture, which appears to differ among high and low-light adapted Prochlorococcus strains, and its role in enhancing the catalytic efficiency of the carbon dioxide-fixing enzyme (RubisCO) that it encapsulates, have only recently been initiated. We will focus on two Prochlorococcus model strains, MIT9313 and MED4, which represent important ecotypes that have distinct physiological characteristics and ecological distributions. Our preliminary data suggest that MIT9313 and MED4 have evolved key structural and compositional differences in their carboxysomes, and these differences are expected to impact carboxysome function and thus, the carbon fixation capabilities of these strains. In order to achieve an integrative understanding of the role played by carboxysomes in carbon metabolism in these Prochlorococcus strains, we are combining biochemical, biophysical and genetic approaches to analyze interactions between carboxysome components and to examine the relationship between structure and function of individual proteins and of the entire carboxysome. This includes purification of carboxysomes from both Prochlorococcus strains, characterization of their specific protein composition, and the use of recombinant proteins to determine the structures and test the functions of individual carboxysome gene products. Moreover, these data will be placed in physiological and ecological contexts via a combination of in vivo gene and protein expression studies under different environmental conditions and metagenomic surveying of content and expression of genes involved in carbon fixation in the open ocean. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Our research will advance our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which Prochlorococcus concentrates and fixes carbon dioxide in the oceans. Furthermore, this study will contribute to our knowledge of the contribution of carboxysomes to optimized carbon fixation by autotrophic bacteria in the water column. This multi-disciplinary research project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the PIs in microbial ecology and physiology, structural biology, biochemistry, molecular biology and bioinformatics. We expect our study to reveal novel insights into the role of carboxysome architecture in optimizing carbon dioxide fixation in the open ocean. This could lead to optimization of or design of other specialized bacterial organelles to enhance carbon dioxide fixation. Undergraduate students will be involved in analyzing DNA sequence and expression data from an ocean survey. The project will provide interdisciplinary training and networking opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students including women and members of under-represented minorities at the three cooperating institutions."

The research will be conducted among Iraqi refugees in Cairo, Egypt. The researcher will employ the social science concept of liminality to understand how refugees in Cairo experience and make meaning in a state of uncertainty between flight and a durable solution such as resettlement. <br/><br/>The research project has three objectives: 1) to examine the relationships between Iraqi refugees in Cairo and international institutions and policies; 2) to understand how Iraqi refugees negotiate the uncertainty that pervades their lives in Cairo; and 3) to investigate the processes through which refugees construct and communicate narratives of displacement, and the effects, if any, of the construction of these narratives on mental health. <br/>The research methods used will include participant observation, ethnographic interviews, narrative analysis, and archival research. <br/><br/>This research project will contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between refugees' experiences and their interactions with international institutions in a context of uncertainty. This research is important because it brings together an emphasis on refugee subjective experiences and an exploration of the institutions and policies that govern refugee lives. In addition, this project aims to contribute to policy debates about refugee health and the role of international institutions in forced migration. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist."

A key concern in many alpine watersheds is metal contamination, either from abandoned mining operations or from natural sources. In order to design and prioritize useful water management and remediation strategies, we need to identify important metal sources and understand how metal loads change over different spatial and temporal scales. We will attack this problem in a new way - by using the emerging tools of Fe and Zn isotopes to fingerprint metal sources and to identify metal transport processes in mountain catchments impacted by acidic, metal-rich waters. <br/>We have framed this investigation to advance scientific understanding in three main areas: 1) Distinguishing between Fe and Zn loads that are attributable to groundwater discharge to surface-water as opposed to surface runoff, 2) Distinguishing between anthropogenic and natural sources of Fe and Zn, and 3) Correlating seasonal changes in Fe and Zn isotopes with hydrogeochemical changes. We will complete our project by integrating our findings into a conceptual model for evaluating metal contamination in alpine waters. Our research plan includes targeted field sampling of waters (both dissolved and suspended loads) and rocks in Prospect and Handcart Gulches in Colorado, and complementary lab experiments with sulfide-rich mineral separates. Both field sites are contaminated with metals and include remarkable access to groundwater through existing networks of monitoring wells. We will also take advantage of differences in metal sources (anthropogenic vs. natural) and in dissimilar groundwater-surface water relationships in these watersheds to test our hypotheses. <br/>Our proposal is collaborative, combining the expertise and resources within the U. S. Geological Survey with PI Borrok and students in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). Our work will specifically broaden participation from underrepresented students already at UTEP. UTEP is the only research-intensive doctoral university in the U.S. with a Mexican-American majority student population. To further enhance educational opportunities, we have partnered with the Mountain Studies Institute, an independent research/education institution and alpine field station in Silverton, Colorado. We will utilize the MSI?s boarding, field laboratory, and educational facilities for our field work in Prospect Gulch. Partnerships with the USGS and MSI will allow students at UTEP access to cutting-edge equipment/facilities and to participate in a broad range of research experiences."

Paradoxically, birth defects of the external genitalia are among the most frequently occurring malformations in humans, ranking second only to heart defects. Some of the most common genital malformations in humans -- such as an open urethral tube and a persistant cloaca (a single outlet for urinary and digestive tracts) -- resemble the natural variation seen across vertebrates. Thus, identification of the mechanisms that direct genitourinary development in non-mammalian vertebrates will have implications for our understanding of abnormal genitourinary development in humans. Moreover, comparative developmental studies will identify the genetic mechanisms that drive evolutionary change. This project investigates the developmental basis of external genital evolution in birds, a group that exhibits a broad spectrum of anatomical patterns that range from an almost mammal-like phallus to complete absence of external genitalia. The approach will combine molecular, cellular, and experimental embryological methods to determine the extent to which the genetic circuits that regulate genital development are conserved between birds and mammals. It is expected that the genetic program that directs genital development in mammals also operates in the most primitive birds, which would point to a surprisingly deep origin of a character that had been thought to be exclusive to mammals. In addition, it is predicted that in a specific group of birds (known as the galliformes), failure to form external genitalia results from disruption of an ancient cell survival mechanism, and excessive cell death causes a developmental arrest. Comparative studies using non-traditional model systems, such as birds and reptiles, are needed to develop new models for disease, and this project will contribute this infrastructure to the research community. Identification of new avian (bird) embryo models is especially important given the prohibitive cost of rodent models for many researchers at small colleges and in countries with limited resources. The impacts of the proposed activities extend beyond scientific discovery. By identifying actual mechanisms of evolutionary change, this research will contribute to society's understanding of how evolution works, which will improve our national literacy in evolution. The project dovetails with educational outreach activities involving students from elementary school to undergraduates, and contains specific action items to increase participation of women and other groups underrepresented in science."

ELEMENTARY PARTICLE ACCEL USER<br/>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Liepe, Matthias U..<br/>TITLE: CAREER: An Integrated Research/Educational Plan for Advancing RF Superconductivity for Particle Accelerators<br/><br/>This proposal requests partial support for a program of research to systematically characterize the radio-frequency(RF) surface resistance of superconductors to advance superconducting microwave cavities for particle accelerators and for an education and outreach program involving community college faculty and students in the research. This will be carried out at the Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-based Sciences and Education at Cornell University.<br/><br/>The ultimate performance of a superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) accelerating cavity is governed by two factors: the maximum accelerating gradient that can be achieved without electrical breakdown, and the cavity Q (or Quality factor) when operating near this maximum gradient. The higher the Q, the less power required to achieve the maximum gradient, and therefore the less cost to both construct and operate the accelerator. The optimal Q of a cavity at a given level of excitation is related to the RF surface resistance of the cavity wall material, and this surface resistance is in turn related to the maximum RF magnetic field at the surface in a way that is both very sample dependent and theoretically poorly understood. The focus of the proposed research program will be on studying the mechanisms that limit the intrinsic Q in SRF cavities, and ways to improve Q. The primary attention in studying these topics will be on the superconductor niobium, which is the material of choice today for SRF cavities. As a subsidiary topic the potential of the A-15 superconductor Nb3Sn for providing highest intrinsic quality factor cavities will be explored. In studying these topics it will be of critical importance to get statistically significant data. This proposal addresses this challenge by developing a host cavity for testing small material samples with fast turnaround. <br/><br/>A new generation of improved superconducting rf cavities would have transformative, broad impact across accelerator-based sciences and engineering by improving the energy reach, performance and scientific potential of future particle accelerators. These next generation accelerators will fulfill the needs for particle physics, nuclear physics, neutron science, X-ray science and free-electron lasers. In addition, this research provides for the education of future generations of accelerator scientists and engineers, which are in high demand. Finally, this proposal includes a program to provide research opportunities in the physical sciences specifically for community college students to encourage them to pursue careers in science, technology, or science education. This large and critical group of students usually has very limited or no access to cutting-edge research opportunities and the proposed pilot program addresses this well-recognized, but mostly unaddressed issue."

A common technique to manufacture such materials is depositing a monocrystalline film on a monocrystalline substrate of a different composition (heteroepitaxy); in the process elastic interactions are very important. The project will develop highly efficient computational tools by combining continuum mechanics to handle long-range elastic interactions with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations that can accurately describe transport kinetics at the atomic level. The methods developed will be broadly applicable, but the immediate focus is on quantum dot nano-structures. Three different approaches will be used to accomplish this task. One of these will use KMC to deduce various parameters used in continuum models. Another approach will be based on a new formulation of KMC which can be shown, using statistical mechanics, to be connected with the chemical potential. This will allow a fairly seamless connection between our KMC formulation and continuum mechanics. We can exploit this connection to use KMC on small, well separated regions and then combine these regions together using macroscopic variables, such as atomic flux and elastic displacement fields. Another approach is to perform KMC everywhere but using coarse-grained continuum fields that are updated on a macroscopic time scale.<br/><br/>Nanocrystalline materials have shown great promise for many applications such as solid state lasers, memory devices, and photovoltaic cells. It is anticipated that the modeling and computation methods developed in this research will pave the way for performing device level simulations and provide valuable guidance in the interpretation of experimental measurements for strained alloy systems.

The standard model is one of an economic decision maker who has well defined preferences over random events that can be represented by probabilistic beliefs and acts to maximize the expectation of a numerical valued utility function in which rewards at different dates are discounted with geometrically declining weights. This model has proven very effective in analyzing behavior in the large, especially in macroeconomics and the study of growth and business cycle fluctuations. On the other hand, there are many known anomalies in the small: the Rabin and Allais paradoxes and the hyperbolic discounting phenomenon, among others. In addition people have preferences not only for their own rewards, but sometimes altruistically and sometimes spitefully care about the rewards of others.<br/><br/>Psychologists have been especially interested in anomalous behavior, especially in the laboratory, and both economists and psychologists have developed a number of behavioral economics models designed to explain these various paradoxes. However these models are largely inconsistent with each other and with behavior in the large. The goal of this project is to study the dual self/self control model as a single consistent framework in which to reconcile all these aspects of behavior.<br/><br/>The dual/self self-control model has a long history, starting as the planner-doer model and continuing through modern axiomatic models of self-control. The project proposes to build on a particular model developed by Drew Fudenberg and me. In this model self-control problems arise due to conflict between a long-run patient self who satisfies the standard axioms of decision theory and a short-run impulsive self who also satisfies the standard axioms of decision theory, but cares only about the moment. This model is motivated by the hyperbolic discounting phenomenon, but in our preliminary work we showed that the conflict between the two selves results in non-classical behavior that has important implications for attitudes towards risk. In particular the model is capable not only of explaining hyperbolic discounting, but also the Rabin paradox of risk aversion. The goal of this project is to examine the extent to which the model can reconcile additional paradoxical or non-standard behavior: the Allais paradox; altruism and spite; the impact of cognitive load and others. We want to incorporate better models of mental accounting, and also explain things such as addiction. Yet at the same time we wish to preserve the overlying long-run behavior observed in the large. The proposal combines theoretical and numerical methods with laboratory experiments and the analysis of data.<br/><br/>The theory has many applications, including the puzzle of why people are willing to pay so much more to help a specific named individual than to reduce statistical risk; the premiums observed in asset markets; and diverse behavior such as risk-taking and gambling."

Plaque instability is a precursor of acute thromboembolic events that lead to strokes, and this instability is related to the microstructural characteristics of the plaque. However, none of the available noninvasive imaging techniques can provide comprehensive information regarding plaque microstructure in vivo. The broad research objective of this proposal is to develop and quantitatively evaluate a novel X-ray imaging method, called multiple-image radiography (MIR), for characterizing carotid plaque microstructure. Unlike conventional radiographic methods that simply measure X-ray absorption, MIR produces two additional images that measure the refractive and ultra-small-angle scattering (USAXS) properties of tissue. The effectiveness of the multiple contrast mechanisms employed by MIR for identifying vulnerable plaques will be rigorously established. This will be the first work to develop and systematically investigate a non-interferometric X-ray phase-contrast modality for imaging carotid plaque microstructure. This innovative imaging method could greatly facilitate identification of high-risk plaques, which is a timely problem with extremely high scientific and clinical significance. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed research arises from the development and refinement of image formation algorithms for a new X-ray imaging modality and their application to the important problem of plaque imaging. Additionally, novel X-ray contrast mechanisms that can effectively characterize plaque microstructure are systematically investigated. To accomplish this research, a combination of physics and fundamental principles of biomedical engineering and imaging science are employed by their interdisciplinary research team. There are several broad impacts of the project that will yield important benefits to both biomedical science and society. The development of a noninvasive imaging method that could reveal plaque microstructure, which is the broad scientific goal of this proposal, would have tremendous value for both clinical and basic science studies. Patients who are prone to plaque rupture could be identified prospectively. This would permit tailoring of treatments to avoid thromboembolic events. Additionally, the ability to characterize plaque microstructure would facilitate an understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the progression of the disease, which would accelerate the development of various therapies for plaque stabilization. The integration of this research with the proposed educational activities will help attract students to the increasingly important fields of biomedical engineering and biomedical imaging and enhance greatly their educational opportunities."

The bulk of these measurements will be made on newly cored ice from the WAIS Divide Ice Core. A robust record ä13C of CO2 will be a valuable addition to the rich data produced from this project. The intellectual merit of the proposed work relates to the fact that explaining glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric CO2 remains a major challenge for paleoclimatology. The lack of a coherent, widely accepted explanation underscores uncertainties in the basic mechanisms that control the carbon cycle, and that lack of understanding limits our ability to confidently predict how the carbon cycle will change in the future, in the face of a potentially major perturbation of both global temperature and the CO2 content of the atmosphere. A widely accepted record of this parameter could transform our understanding of how the carbon cycle and climate change are linked. The broader impacts of the work include training of graduate student at OSU who will conduct much of the lab work and will also participate in fieldwork at the WAIS Divide Core site. The student will also participate in a number of organized outreach efforts and will develop his own outreach effort, through weblogs and other communication of his research. The PIs will communicate the results from this project to a variety of audiences through academic courses and public talks. The proposed work addresses a major topic in biogeochemistry, the origin of glacial-interglacial CO2 cycles. The results are relevant to understanding changes in the carbon cycle due to human activities because the lack of clear understanding of past variations contributes to public uncertainty about the importance of modern climate change. The proposed funding will also contribute to analytical infrastructure at OSU and develop an analytical capability for an ice core measurement currently not available in the United States."

The overall goal of the facility is to image and analyze crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) fabrics and microstructures. The facility will comprise capabilities for optical orientation analysis with Computer Integrated Polarization (CIP) microscopy and fracture microstructural analysis using epifluorescence microscopy. Requested are an Olympus BX51 scope with fluorescence and digital imaging capabilities fitted with CIP and an Olympus SZX-16 scope with polarization accessories. For digital imaging, a workstation with digitizing monitor is requested. For sample preparation, a precision saw, grinder/polisher and accessories are requested. The instrumentation will be employed for on-going NSF EAR-funded research on seismic rupture pre- and post-rupture plastic deformation in the lower and middle continental crust. Quartz crystallographic orientation will be assayed along with fracture density and grain size distributions to better understand deformation mechanisms and paleostress conditions from middle and deep crust seismic faults. Quartz vein and pseudotachylyte-bearing samples will be analyzed to understand deformation mechanisms. CIP and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) will be used to map orientation and this in turn will be related to estimate the strain field during deformation. Associated projects will have the instrumentation applied to analyzing snowpack rheology by determining preferred orientation at sintered grain snow boundaries, apatite orientation in fossil bones as a proxy for stress adaptation and lifestyle, and the orientation of calcite crystals in fossil dinosaur and bird eggs to better understand the evolution of avian reproduction. The instrumentation will be incorporated into existing laboratory space in one of two buildings. The preparation equipment will be incorporated into an existing rock preparation room. Maintenance costs are assumed to be minimal with supply estimates at only ~$1,250 per year. Expendable supplies will be charged to applicable research grants. A nominal fee will be charged to users in anticipation of computer and software maintenance costs. The MNM lab will compliment instrumentation already available at MSU. The requested EBSD sample preparation equipment will allow higher sample throughput and alleviate the need to prepare samples in another department. Interdisciplinary and inter-departmental collaboration will be possible through the new facility. Due to the robust nature of the requested equipment, students will gain hands-on experience and education. Due to the unique nature of this facility, disseminated results will be of broad interest. <br/><br/>***"

Best known for the primitive ape Proconsul and catarrhine primates Dendropithecus, Nyanzapithecus, and Limnopithecus, Rusinga/Mfwangano sites also preserve copious mammal, reptile, bird, and invertebrate fossils, as well as rarely seen fossil elements such as leaves, seeds, fruits, and insects. Thus, it becomes possible to reconstruct not just the anatomy of these primates, but also their chronological context, aspects of their feeding ecology, habitat preferences, and the broader ecological community in which they thrived. This project will undertake new research on Rusinga/Mfangano to further our knowledge of the chronology and paleoecology of stem catarrhines and hominoids. Specific objectives are to: 1) establish stratigraphic and chronological control within and among primate fossil sites on Rusinga and Mfangano; and 2) reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions throughout the geological sequence to assess the ecological parameters in which these primates lived. Work will be carried out over three summers and include basic stratigraphic analysis, absolute and relative dating, controlled fossil collection, analyses of stable isotopes, revisions of existing faunal collections, and dental microwear analysis. The intellectual merit of this project lies in combining geological, paleontological, and paleoecological methodologies to substantially advance our knowledge of hominoid evolution and adaptation through development of high-resolution chronostratigraphic data and detailed paleoecological models for Rusinga and Mfangano catarrhine primates. This project also has considerable broader impact in promoting education and cooperation at the local level, advancing local involvement in the preservation of the fossil heritage, employing local and national Kenyan workers, educating undergraduate and graduate students, and promoting international and interdisciplinary collaborations."

Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the principal form of the hormone. Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) is a naturally-occurring compound that is converted to IAA in plant cells, providing a source of IAA when and where the active hormone is required. IBA is used widely in horticulture to initiate rooting in cuttings in a variety of plant species. However, how IBA is converted to IAA is not known. The research activities presented here use biochemical and genetic approaches to determine the mechanism of the IBA-to-IAA conversion and identify the specific roles(s) of IBA in plant growth and development. Identification of the enzymes that catalyze these reactions and the impact of IBA activity will further our understanding of auxin metabolism. These specific aims will be first steps towards the long-term goal of understanding the importance of, purpose for, and interactions between different IAA-metabolic pathways; application of this knowledge will allow manipulation of these pathways to increase rooting and enhance plant growth. The education section of this project includes creation of an inquiry-based plant molecular biology lab, designed to increase opportunities for undergraduate research. The primary objective of this course is to increase student understanding of the scientific process by generating a hands-on project that will engage and enlighten students. Research aims from the proposal will be directly integrated into the course, providing students an exposure to real-world science while advancing the understanding of IBA metabolism. Undergraduate participants will present their work at local high schools, thereby exposing the next generation of students to scientific research and future opportunities."

The method, pressure-assisted combustion synthesis (PACS), combines conventional self-propagating high-temperature synthesis and foaming in one operation. The research approach has theoretical and experimental components. A multi-scale mathematical model of the process is developed to quantify the microstructure-property relationship and establish the parameter space for production of the desired microstructure. PACS is then used to synthesize porous intermetallic material, utilizing the processing conditions obtained from the mathematical model. The materials produced are subjected to microscopy and mechanical testing, and the results are used to validate the mathematical model, identify deficiencies and optimize the process. Deliverables include modeling and analysis tools across dimensional scales, student education, and documentation of research results in reports, journals, and theses. <br/><br/>This research, if successful, will provide a cost-effective, energy efficient and environmentally benign method for producing porous structural materials with desired microstructure and mechanical properties. Example application includes optimization of the production of net-shape biomedical structural implants to improve the outcomes of prostheses procedures, reduce costs, reduce failure rates, and enhance the quality of life of patients with prostheses. The methodology is also applicable to a wider class of complex materials processes involving non-linear coupled transport-reaction phenomena with moving interfaces. Many such processes are relevant to critical defense and commercial needs for materials such as near-net shape monolithic ceramics or ceramic composites for the High Speed Civil Transport combustors. Undergraduate and graduate students will be engaged in the research, and will benefit from classroom instruction and the multidisciplinary training in diverse fields of materials processing, reactive engineering, thermal science and numerical methods."

Since the most abundant living organisms on Earth are bacteria, the majority of these viruses are phages, the viruses which infect bacteria. Through their diverse lifestyles and gene products, phages play important roles in horizontal gene exchange, in structuring natural microbial communities, and in global biogeochemical cycles. Phages carry genes for some of the deadliest toxins known and can also carry genes which confer adaptive advantages to the hosts they infect. Furthermore, phage genes and the proteins they encode are the outcome of evolution over eons, the products of which we would be able to exploit if only we could decode the information in the phage DNA sequences. The number of available phage genome sequences is increasing rapidly; on the other hand, they represent the largest global reservoir of uncharacterized genetic material. Bioinformatic tools necessary for interpreting this data has lagged behind the growth in genome sequences. Grants to develop a platform and toolbox of computational tools for phage genome analysis have been awarded to support collaborative research in the laboratories of Drs. Robert Edwards, Department of Computer Sciences, San Diego State University, Mya Breitbart, College of Marine Sciences, University of South Florida, Jeffrey Elhai, Biology Department, Virginia Commonwealth University and Matthew Sullivan, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona. Dr. Elhai is an Associate Professor, the other three investigators are Assistant Professors. This collaborative project is creating new computational tools to establish a consistent nomenclature for phage genomes, to annotate phage sequences, both from completely sequenced phage genomes and from environmental phage metagenome sequences. Most importantly, this project will engage a wide spectrum of researchers, regardless of their computational background, to access the wealth of information contained in phage genomes through familiar graphical interfaces. These collaborators have developed an extensive and far-reaching education plan that targets high school students, undergraduate students and graduate students. The students trained in the use of the tools will rotate into trainer roles via user forums and workshops. The postdocs will be working across all the labs and thereby gain an unparalleled panoramic view of phage biology."

At the same time, other disturbances, such as acidification, interact with nitrogen enrichment in ways that strongly influence the productivity and health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This project examines the interactions among multiple elements and disturbances (nitrogen, phosphorus, metals, and acidification) along a continuum from the atmosphere through soils to streams. This project takes advantage of two unique experiments in which entire watersheds have been experimentally enriched with nitrogen and acid for nearly two decades. A series of new studies in those watersheds examine how chemical and biological changes in soils alter the ability of streams to take up, use, and retain nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrient interactions are then related to important biological processes that affect the productivity and health of streams.<br/><br/>This research addresses an important pollution problem that requires an approach that integrates biology and geochemistry along flow paths that link the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This type of integration is a challenge, but needed for effective environmental management, environmental research, and science teaching. Results from this project and interactions between university and US Forest Service researchers will inform effective management of watersheds faced with multiple pollution problems. A series of collaborative workshops in which high school, undergraduate, and graduate students work with researchers and teachers will promote multidisciplinary learning. The collaboration will seek to develop a computer simulation model for use in teaching integrated biology and chemistry in high school and college science curricula."

The ice core records are annually resolved and exceptionally well dated, and will provide, through the analyses of stable isotopes, major soluble ions and for some trace elements, instrumentally calibrated proxies for past temperature, precipitation, atmospheric circulation, chemistry of the atmosphere, sea ice extent, and volcanic activity. These records will be used to understand the role of solar, volcanic, and human forcing on Antarctic climate and to investigate the character of recent abrupt climate change over Antarctica in the context of broader Southern Hemisphere and global climate variability. The intellectual merit of the project is that ITASE has resulted in an array of ice core records, increasing the spatial resolution of observations of recent Antarctic climate variability by more than an order of magnitude and provides the basis for assessment of past and current change and establishes a framework for monitoring of future climate change in the Southern Hemisphere. This comes at a critical time as global record warming and other impacts are noted in the Southern Ocean, the Antarctic Peninsula, and on the Antarctic ice sheet. The broader impacts of the project are that Post-doctoral and graduate students involved in the project will benefit from exposure to observational and modeling approaches to climate change research and working meetings to be held at the two collaborating institutions plus other prominent climate change institutions.  The results are of prime interest to the public and the media  Websites hosted by the two collaborating institutions contain climate change position papers, scientific exchanges concerning current climate change issues, and scientific contribution series.<br/><br/>"

By studying the links of association between individuals we can derive unique insights into the workings of the society, and better understand the various behavioral strategies that individuals use to enhance their success. The study of animal social networks requires that associations between individuals be continuously monitored for extended periods of time. The task of determining social associations and movement patterns is usually attempted via direct observation methods. However, in many cases, observation is not feasible, especially when animals must be continuously monitored for long periods of time, when animals behave cryptically (as they often do), or when animals are out of sight of observers. <br/><br/>The Encounternet project will result in a miniaturized tag device for social network and behavioral studies. This microprocessor-based digital radio tag technology allows autonomous monitoring of the proximity of each tagged animal to all other nearby tagged individuals on a continuous basis. Encounternet consists of two components: small groving node transceiver tags mounted on animals, and collection node devices placed at fixed locations in the field. The roving node tags will weigh approximately 1g, allowing placement on small animals such as song birds, rodents, and reptiles, and will employ energy harvesting technology to extend their lifespan. To achieve the desired encounter monitoring functionality and enable a significant improvement in miniaturization, Encounternet will utilize integrated circuit advances in wireless transceivers, a new social network monitoring radio protocol design, and an energy harvesting low voltage solar powertrain to augment battery power.<br/><br/>For behavioral recording, Encounternet tags can be equipped with a variety of sensors, including accelerometers, microphones, and light monitors. Sensor-equipped tags can be configured to wirelessly stream sensor data to a receiver or store it in onboard non-volatile memory for later retrieval. This technology allows researchers to acquire an enormous amount of rich information about study animals, their spatial movement patterns, behavior, even physiological state, which would be impossible to acquire using conventional analog tracking technology, allowing animal movements, social association, and behavior to be monitored on a continuous basis for the entire study period.<br/><br/>The development of Encounternet will promote outreach in the following ways. A prototype network will be deployed in field tests with various collaborators who study animal social behavior. Although Encounternet is intended for small animal social network research, it can be applied to a wide variety of applications, including disease vector species interaction, below-ground social interactions in fossorial species, and spatial/temporal decision making processes in herds and flocks. Tours of the Discovery Park (Seattle, WA) prototype deployment will be given to groups of high-school students to promote interest in both technology and nature."

While anger can reduce depth of information processing and promote biased decisions, sadness can promote systematic processing and facilitate objective decision making. Thus, the potential for VIS to influence juror sentencing decisions might depend on whether jurors experience sadness or anger in response to VIS. <br/><br/>The first study examines VIS from actual capital cases. For descriptive analyses, method of VIS delivery, number length of VIS testimony, and emotional content of VIS will be examined. Content analysis of VIS will be done to assess the emotions typically expressed by victims, and whether angry or sad VIS predicts sentencing decisions. The second study manipulates sadness and anger (using VIS obtained in Study 1) and measures the effect of these specific emotions on sentencing decisions and information. <br/><br/>Little research has examined the effects of specific negative emotions on juror information processing and decision making. The results of these studies will contribute to basic theory on the effects of emotions on decision making. Furthermore, results will inform the applied field of psycho-legal science and aid in understanding of how non-legal factors influence jury decision making. <br/><br/>Results will shed light on how and when victim impact statements lead to biased decisions, and may provide the courts with information to guide how they accept VIS in their jurisdictions. Research results will be disseminated broadly, and a large database of capital sentencing transcripts will be created and made available to other researchers."

This project investigates the population genetics of three co-occurring montane members of the genus Hyperolius, which have an endemic diversification within these mountains. Preliminary results indicate that populations show significant structure throughout this area, with a clear pattern of Northward colonization, potentially mitigated by climate cycles. <br/><br/>The Eastern Arc Mountains are a Conservation International Biodiversity Hot Spot, with a substantial diversity of amphibians, almost all of which are endemic to this tiny area. Lawson will sample localities predicted by bioclim models in Diva-GIS from the paraphyletic ?break zone? between haplotypes. She will also extend this work through the highlands of Malawi to sample populations thought to be outgroups to all Eastern Arc populations. During this time Lawson will be working with W. Ngalason (Tanzanian PhD student) on elevational patterns of Eastern Arc amphibians in the field and in the collections at the University of Dar es Salaam, and will conduct survey work of understudied mountains with the East African Montane Herpetology working group, of which she and W. Ngalason are members. This study will be one of the first to combine ecological and phylogenetic information for a genus of African frogs to assess the effects of historic habitat fragmentation on populations. This system is ideal for combining climatic/landscape modeling and cutting-edge molecular techniques to investigate the evolutionary processes that helped shape variation in a poorly known, megadiverse and threatened system. Such studies have important implications for conservation planning.<br/><br/>This research program has a strong focus on working with local Tanzanian researchers and students, providing training in sampling, monitoring techniques, and population genetics. Pressure for agricultural lands, extensive logging of forests and other activities in Tanzania have drastically reduced the available montane habitat in this tropical region and developing a strong local involvement in monitoring and conservation is the key to keeping this system alive. Though the primary focus of this study is to enhance our understanding of the dynamics of a ?meta-population? in a naturally fragmented landscape, the researchers are also collecting information on communities as well as distributional, ecological, and behavioral data. Upon completion of this work, all resulting scientific papers will be submitted to the Tanzanian research council (COSTECH) and the Tanzanian Wildlife Department (TAWIRI), as dictated by collection permits and published in both US journals and African Journals to allow access to these findings for the researchers who need them most. In Illinois, Lawson has given talks on evolution, climate change and conservation, and amphibian declines to grade and high school children and groups at the Field Museum. This research program will be extended to include a student mentorship project through the Illinois Math & Science Academy and University of Chicago undergraduates will be incorporated in the analysis of genetic patterns and modeling of processes, providing a valuable research experience to potential future evolutionary and conservation biologists."

It addresses how these foreland arches form and how they are linked to plate tectonic processes. The research in the Rocky Mountain Bighorn Arch of northern Wyoming and southern Montana combines geological investigations of surface geometries and kinematic indicators with geophysical imaging of 3D crustal and upper mantle geometries from an active/passive seismic experiment. The resulting 4D (3D spatial and temporal), lithospheric-scale model of foreland arch deformation tests current hypotheses for basement-involved foreland thrust belts both in the Rockies and in active orogens of Asia and the Andes. These hypotheses include: 1) fault blocks defined by lithosphere-penetrating thrust faults, 2) subhorizontal detachment within the crust, 3) lithospheric buckling, and 4) pure shear lithospheric thickening. Our investigation to determine the mechanism driving basement-involved arch formation is advancing our understanding of continental lithospheric rheology. <br/><br/> This three year (2009-12) collaborative project defines a lithospheric volume of 1.5 x106 km3 by integrating arch-scale upper crustal geometries derived from surface exposures and petroleum industry subsurface data (Eric Erslev, University of Wyoming; Christine Siddoway, Colorado College) with the results of a hybrid seismic experiment. The passive component of this experiment consists of a 1.25 year (2009-10) deployment of 27 broadband seismometers that densify the EarthScope transportable array (Megan Anderson, Colorado College), a 6.5 month deployment of 220 short period seismometers (Anne Sheehan, University of Colorado), and a 9 day deployment of 800 high frequency ""Texan"" seismometers (Kate Miller, University of Texas at El Paso). The active component consists of 9 shots (summer 2010) recorded by the above instruments and an additional 1600 ""Texan"" seismometers deployed for 5 days. These instruments are arrayed in a grid consisting of three SW-NE lines and two NW-SE lines with a total line length of 1000 km. Joint inversion of active and passive results defines crustal and upper mantle velocities and interface structures within the Bighorn Arch. These new seismic results are integrated (2010-12) within a GIS-based, 3D geospatial framework including data from exposures, geologic maps and industry subsurface data for the study area. Kinematic information from fracture transects (Erslev, Siddoway) and gravity modeling (Miller) is used to guide 3D, lithosphere-scale structural restorations to test the compatibility of different components in our 3D geometric model. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the Bighorn Project partially lies in the development of fundamental methods for quantitative integration of geological and seismological research. In addition, the Bighorn Project involves a broad range of geoscientists, including one post-doctoral fellow, 4 graduate students, and >15 undergraduates, who will participate in IRIS and Keck Consortium sponsored research. The results have key implications for energy resources, allowing the prediction of open fractures that are critical to hydrocarbon production. The development of a dramatic animation showing the 4D structural development of the Bighorns Arch during the Laramide Orogeny provides important public outreach."

In this study, metal cutting will be performed on a customized sub-stage within the sample chamber of a scanning electron microscope in a configuration that enables direct visualization and characterization of the deformation zone in secondary and backscattered electron imaging modes. Subsequently, the mechanics of deformation will be delineated in situ through digital image correlation of sequences of secondary electron micrographs of the micromachining process. The microstructural consequences of micrometer-scale surface generation will be studied using electron backscattered diffraction techniques. Together, these characterizations can enable a detailed demarcation of the thermomechanical material response during material removal at small length-scales.<br/><br/>If successful, this research may significantly enhance the current level of understanding of the micromachining process and possibly supplant the extant experimental paradigms which offer at best, a post-deformation, ex situ scheme entirely devoid of the dynamic details of the operative micromechanisms. It is envisioned that the interdisciplinary framework inherent to this research may offer unique opportunities for multi-faceted development of graduate students by bringing together elements of vacuum device design, quantitative electron microscopy as well as computational image processing methodologies. An impact on advancing undergraduate education is envisaged via integration with existing courses in manufacturing and creation of a new course aimed at seniors and juniors in the Industrial, Mechanical and Materials Science disciplines."

To the widely recognized social and economic consequences of post-World War II urban restructuring--rising income inequality, hyper-segregation, gentrification, and uneven redevelopment--this study adds environmental consequences, which require a new method of longitudinal data collection and analysis. The study's goal is to develop,<br/>demonstrate, and refine such a methodology in order to bring environmental changes in urban lands center stage and, in the process, improve understanding of urbanization as a critical and ongoing link between society, nature, and the human condition. This new methodology will extend beyond traditional concerns with political economic and socio-spatial processes to incorporate environmental concerns of known scientific importance: the accumulation and distribution of ""relict industrial waste,"" that is, environmental hazards produced in earlier eras that have become hidden with time and may still pose significant health risks. Examining these dynamics requires a new approach?one that begins in the past, with parcels formerly occupied by hazardous industry, and proceeds to the present to examine what these sites have become, when, and where. Three propositions frame this effort, each subject to empirical investigation and refinement: 1) Prior to increasing environmental awareness and regulation of the 1980s, hundreds of thousands of manufacturers came and went in U.S. cities, dumping hazardous waste on site; 2) Many of these sites have now converted to other uses, effectively hiding relict waste from public view, government regulation, and scholarly inquiry; 3) How and where these changes in urban lands have occurred--first through manufacturing and onsite waste disposal, then through site conversion--depend greatly on social and economic processes happening around them, over time.<br/><br/>Regarding broader impacts, results from the study have the potential to transform how sociologists study cities in ways that not only enrich sociology but build bridges to related fields of environmental history, geography and regional sciences, science and technology studies, and public health. These contributions can offer important theoretical advances for understanding urban-environmental change, inform regulatory mandates involving environmental justice, and offer comparative insights that can help scholars and policymakers distinguish general from place-specific processes of industrial production, land use conversion, and environmental inequality."

While various biochemical markers of cells have been extensively used for decades, biomechanical properties such as cell stiffness are increasingly recognized as an important indicator of cell type and physiological state. The mechanical properties of cells are defined by the membrane, cytoskeleton and the volume of the cell, and are likely associated with basic characteristics including type, growth, stage of differentiation, and response to the environment. Existing mechanical characterization tools, however, can only examine a few cells at a time, severely limiting their utility and application due to the low throughput associated with the sequential isolation and probing of individual cells. <br/>Here, a high-throughput method will be developed, where optical-based mechanical ?stretching? forces are applied to cells in microfluidic devices.

Phase II will focus on technical objectives that will enhance the quality and reliability of the information produced by the ChatterSpike concept researched in Phase I. These objectives fall into three categories: data cleansing, context analysis, and basic commercial readiness. Their achievement will require the design, development and implementation of novel, niche-focused algorithms that will enable the mining and evaluation of thousands of online sources and the production of data with quantifiable quality metrics relating to authority, reliability, influence, and sentiment. The resulting product will algorithmically determine and quantitatively measure and evaluate these parameters in real time as it mines online sources for data, validating its conclusions and re-validating them every time it performs a retrieval operation.<br/><br/>By focusing on specific industry niches, the technology produced will enable the production of automated, highly tailored, detailed reports with a high degree of quantitatively-confirmed reliability. This capability will result from the creation of novel algorithms designed to exploit cutting-edge theoretical approaches to extracting, validating, and evaluating information from a multiplicity of online sources. These reports will be superior to the manual reports produced by currently available technologies and approaches. In addition, if successful, the technology will have significant societal benefit. Companies will be able to react more quickly to meet consumer demands and to correct negative trends in consumer opinions. The technology will also be able to detect trends reliably at a very early stage; in some cases weeks or months before they become obvious and are detected by other methods."

Sphingolipids also play important roles in the regulation of basic processes in plant cells, including the initiation of cell death in response to pathogens. Sphingolipids occur in plants as complex mixtures of different chemical structures. The specific contributions of different sphingolipids to the growth and physiology of plants is not well understood. This question will be addressed in this project by the generation of mutants of the model plants Arabidopsis and tomato with defined alterations in sphingolipid structures. These mutants will be characterized by advanced analytical methods to determine the impact on global sphingolipid metabolism. Studies will also be conducted with Arabidopsis and tomato mutants to examine how altered sphingolipid composition affects growth in response to environmental stresses, including drought and high soil salinity. In addition to generating fundamental new knowledge on sphingolipid metabolism and function in plants, the results will provide information that could lead to improving the performance and productivity of crop plants through breeding and biotechnology.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>The project will offer educational opportunities and outreach to high school and undergraduate students. The PI and co-PI will participate in the Partnership in Research and Education in Plants, a program that engages high school students in the scientific process by allowing them to devise experiments using mutants of the model plant Arabidopsis. The PI and co-PI will meet with participating students at a Saint Louis, Missouri-area high school and describe the important functions of cellular membranes as well as sphingolipids in human health and plant growth. The students will be provided with seeds for Arabidopsis mutants that they will use for experiments to test hypotheses regarding growth and environmental stress responses. The students will maintain interactions with the PI and co-PI through an online laboratory notebook. The project is also designed to provide research opportunities to undergraduates through the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Undergraduate Creative Activities and Research Experiences (UCARE) program, a two-year program that allows students to conduct literature research and develop an independent research project.

It addresses how these foreland arches form and how they are linked to plate tectonic processes. The research in the Rocky Mountain Bighorn Arch of northern Wyoming and southern Montana combines geological investigations of surface geometries and kinematic indicators with geophysical imaging of 3D crustal and upper mantle geometries from an active/passive seismic experiment. The resulting 4D (3D spatial and temporal), lithospheric-scale model of foreland arch deformation tests current hypotheses for basement-involved foreland thrust belts both in the Rockies and in active orogens of Asia and the Andes. These hypotheses include: 1) fault blocks defined by lithosphere-penetrating thrust faults, 2) subhorizontal detachment within the crust, 3) lithospheric buckling, and 4) pure shear lithospheric thickening. Our investigation to determine the mechanism driving basement-involved arch formation is advancing our understanding of continental lithospheric rheology. <br/><br/> This three year (2009-12) collaborative project defines a lithospheric volume of 1.5 x106 km3 by integrating arch-scale upper crustal geometries derived from surface exposures and petroleum industry subsurface data (Eric Erslev, University of Wyoming; Christine Siddoway, Colorado College) with the results of a hybrid seismic experiment. The passive component of this experiment consists of a 1.25 year (2009-10) deployment of 27 broadband seismometers that densify the EarthScope transportable array (Megan Anderson, Colorado College), a 6.5 month deployment of 220 short period seismometers (Anne Sheehan, University of Colorado), and a 9 day deployment of 800 high frequency ""Texan"" seismometers (Kate Miller, University of Texas at El Paso). The active component consists of 9 shots (summer 2010) recorded by the above instruments and an additional 1600 ""Texan"" seismometers deployed for 5 days. These instruments are arrayed in a grid consisting of three SW-NE lines and two NW-SE lines with a total line length of 1000 km. Joint inversion of active and passive results defines crustal and upper mantle velocities and interface structures within the Bighorn Arch. These new seismic results are integrated (2010-12) within a GIS-based, 3D geospatial framework including data from exposures, geologic maps and industry subsurface data for the study area. Kinematic information from fracture transects (Erslev, Siddoway) and gravity modeling (Miller) is used to guide 3D, lithosphere-scale structural restorations to test the compatibility of different components in our 3D geometric model. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the Bighorn Project partially lies in the development of fundamental methods for quantitative integration of geological and seismological research. In addition, the Bighorn Project involves a broad range of geoscientists, including one post-doctoral fellow, 4 graduate students, and >15 undergraduates, who will participate in IRIS and Keck Consortium sponsored research. The results have key implications for energy resources, allowing the prediction of open fractures that are critical to hydrocarbon production. The development of a dramatic animation showing the 4D structural development of the Bighorns Arch during the Laramide Orogeny provides important public outreach."

Changes in regional hydroclimate will exacerbate threats to sustainable water supplies from growing populations, pollution, declining infrastructure, and resource conflicts. One robust prediction of the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate model ensemble is that precipitation rates will decrease over Guatemala and most parts of Central America in both the summer and winter under future increased greenhouse gas scenarios. Critical to mitigating the consequences of changes in water availability is a long-term perspective on the potential range of variability in precipitation and the integration of this knowledge within water planning and natural resources policy. However, long-term instrumental records of drought are sparse in Guatemala and throughout the Central American tropics. This is particularly true for high elevation regions, which are likely to demonstrate the earliest and more severe local consequences of global climate change. In the absence of long instrumental records, scientists investigating the causes and consequences of climate variability and change depend on proxy records that can be used to reconstruct past ocean-atmosphere conditions. Tree-ring chronologies form the bulk of the available, high-resolution terrestrial proxy records. However, they are almost entirely absent from the tropical Americas south of Mexico. The lack of a high resolution, long-term perspective on drought from this region also limits opportunities to validate climate model predictions. The development of long, annually resolved records of climate from this region is therefore necessary for understanding the local response to broad-scale forcing, detecting and attributing long-term trends related to anthropogenic climate change, and verifying the fidelity of the climate models used as the primary forecasting tool for predicting future change.<br/><br/>The investigators will expand the geographic frontier of dendroclimatology into the mountains of Guatemala, identifying species and sites which show sensitivity to precipitation, and developing estimates of drought variability over the last several centuries. They will investigate and utilize a combination of high elevation tropical conifer species in this study. All candidate taxa will be carefully and systematically examined to establish annual ring formation and chronology development. Once dating and chronology development has been completed and verified, the tree-ring time series will be compared against the available local and gridded meteorological data in order to detect physiologically reasonable climate/growth relationships. Models will be developed to estimate past climate anomalies from the absolutely dated ring width series. Reconstructions of past precipitation and drought will be objectively compared against independently developed climate fields as well as estimates of past forcing. The drought reconstructions will also be used to interpret the possible role of climate in important historical events of the last several hundred years. This research will provide a long-term context for drought variability that is critical for efforts to mitigate the consequences for vulnerable human populations from climatic change. Active outreach and participatory education in Maya communities in the regions are integrated in the proposed research."

A common technique to manufacture such materials is depositing a monocrystalline film on a monocrystalline substrate of a different composition (heteroepitaxy); in the process elastic interactions are very important. The project will develop highly efficient computational tools by combining continuum mechanics to handle long-range elastic interactions with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations that can accurately describe transport kinetics at the atomic level. The methods developed will be broadly applicable, but the immediate focus is on quantum dot nano-structures. Three different approaches will be used to accomplish this task. One of these will use KMC to deduce various parameters used in continuum models. Another approach will be based on a new formulation of KMC which can be shown, using statistical mechanics, to be connected with the chemical potential. This will allow a fairly seamless connection between our KMC formulation and continuum mechanics. We can exploit this connection to use KMC on small, well separated regions and then combine these regions together using macroscopic variables, such as atomic flux and elastic displacement fields. Another approach is to perform KMC everywhere but using coarse-grained continuum fields that are updated on a macroscopic time scale.<br/><br/>Nanocrystalline materials have shown great promise for many applications such as solid state lasers, memory devices, and photovoltaic cells. It is anticipated that the modeling and computation methods developed in this research will pave the way for performing device level simulations and provide valuable guidance in the interpretation of experimental measurements for strained alloy systems. Our group has close ties with experimental groups based in the semiconductor industry and academia, which will allow us to assess our modeling progress."

Lee will conduct research on how international medical tourism affects local populations. Health care, once the most localized of activities, is expanding into a global arena. The practice of patients traveling to foreign countries for medical procedures is now a rapidly expanding, multibillion dollar global industry. However, little is known about local social effects in the countries to which these ""tourists"" travel.<br/><br/>The research will be carried out in Costa Rica, long lauded for its successes in public health and a popular destination for elective medical procedures. Despite pressures to privatize, the Costa Rican health system remains almost exclusively public, while medical tourism is a private industry. This context provides a unique opportunity to examine the ways in which the line between public and private line is navigated, the impacts of integrating this powerful global industry into a state-oriented system, and the potential implications that medical tourism has for health care of local, underprivileged populations.<br/><br/>This project utilizes a multi-level, multi-sited, comparative ethnographic design to examine the relationships among international entities, national government, and on the ground practices that surround medical tourism. Lee will interview brokerages in the United States to understand how companies operate and their relationship with hospitals in Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, she will conduct semi-structured interviews with health officials and carry out ethnographic field research in one public and one private hospital. She will observe and interview physicians, patients, and administrators; document hospital procedures and protocols; and collect information on attitudes and opinions about medical tourism, motivations to practice in the public or private sphere, comparative salaries and benefits, and job satisfaction. <br/><br/>The remarkable growth of medical tourism coupled with the lack of research in this arena makes this project timely and significant. This project addresses important social policy issues, particularly for underrepresented populations, as well as issues of social responsibility for industries. It also contributes to the education of a social scientist."

The specific focus of the project is on abiotic stress combinations and the genetic and metabolic networks that respond to stress combinations such as drought and heat, drought and salinity and salinity and heat. Abiotic stress is the primary cause of crop loss world-wide, with losses in the US estimated at 14-19 billion dollars each year. While abiotic stress is routinely studied in Arabidopsis by applying a single stress condition such as drought, salinity or heat, this type of analysis does not reflect the conditions that occur in the field where crop plants are subjected to a combination of different stresses. The central objective of the project is to identify novel genes, gene networks and metabolic pathways that specifically respond to a combination of two different abiotic stresses. The hypothesis to be tested is that dedicated genes, networks and pathways are activated in plants that are simultaneously exposed to two different stress conditions. This project is designed to bring Arabidopsis into the front line of applied research on abiotic stress tolerance, and bridge the gap between stress studies conducted with Arabidopsis in the lab and the conditions that impact crops in the field. The two key ""Broader Impacts"" of the proposed research are: 1) Development and maintenance of a centralized website that will bring together agronomists, breeders and Arabidopsis molecular biologists (http://www.ag.unr.edu/Stress_Combination/). 2) Educational outreach for K-12 and multidisciplinary training to postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduates trainees. Both undergraduate and K-12 outreach and training activities will target the under privileged and under represented in Science. Historically, abiotic stress combinations, such as drought and heat, had the outmost devastating economical and sociological impacts on the US, with losses of 48.4 and 61.6 billion dollars in 1980 and 1988 respectively. The proposed project will pave the way for the development of crops with enhanced abiotic stress tolerance, contributing to ameliorate the consequences of future weather disasters that are likely to increase in frequency due to anticipated climatic changes."

Since the most<br/>abundant living organisms on Earth are bacteria, the majority of these viruses are<br/>phages, the viruses which infect bacteria. Through their diverse lifestyles and gene<br/>products, phages play important roles in horizontal gene exchange, in structuring<br/>natural microbial communities, and in global biogeochemical cycles. Phages carry<br/>genes for some of the deadliest toxins known and can also carry genes which confer<br/>adaptive advantages to the hosts they infect. Furthermore, phage genes and the<br/>proteins they encode are the outcome of evolution over eons, the products of which we<br/>would be able to exploit if only we could decode the information in the phage DNA<br/>sequences. The number of available phage genome sequences is increasing rapidly; on<br/>the other hand, they represent the largest global reservoir of uncharacterized genetic<br/>material. Bioinformatic tools necessary for interpreting this data has lagged behind the<br/>growth in genome sequences. Grants to develop a platform and toolbox of<br/>computational tools for phage genome analysis have been awarded to support<br/>collaborative research in the laboratories of Drs.

It addresses how these foreland arches form and how they are linked to plate tectonic processes. The research in the Rocky Mountain Bighorn Arch of northern Wyoming and southern Montana combines geological investigations of surface geometries and kinematic indicators with geophysical imaging of 3D crustal and upper mantle geometries from an active/passive seismic experiment. The resulting 4D (3D spatial and temporal), lithospheric-scale model of foreland arch deformation tests current hypotheses for basement-involved foreland thrust belts both in the Rockies and in active orogens of Asia and the Andes. These hypotheses include: 1) fault blocks defined by lithosphere-penetrating thrust faults, 2) subhorizontal detachment within the crust, 3) lithospheric buckling, and 4) pure shear lithospheric thickening. Our investigation to determine the mechanism driving basement-involved arch formation is advancing our understanding of continental lithospheric rheology. <br/><br/> This three year (2009-12) collaborative project defines a lithospheric volume of 1.5 x106 km3 by integrating arch-scale upper crustal geometries derived from surface exposures and petroleum industry subsurface data (Eric Erslev, University of Wyoming; Christine Siddoway, Colorado College) with the results of a hybrid seismic experiment. The passive component of this experiment consists of a 1.25 year (2009-10) deployment of 27 broadband seismometers that densify the EarthScope transportable array (Megan Anderson, Colorado College), a 6.5 month deployment of 220 short period seismometers (Anne Sheehan, University of Colorado), and a 9 day deployment of 800 high frequency ""Texan"" seismometers (Kate Miller, University of Texas at El Paso). The active component consists of 9 shots (summer 2010) recorded by the above instruments and an additional 1600 ""Texan"" seismometers deployed for 5 days. These instruments are arrayed in a grid consisting of three SW-NE lines and two NW-SE lines with a total line length of 1000 km. Joint inversion of active and passive results defines crustal and upper mantle velocities and interface structures within the Bighorn Arch. These new seismic results are integrated (2010-12) within a GIS-based, 3D geospatial framework including data from exposures, geologic maps and industry subsurface data for the study area. Kinematic information from fracture transects (Erslev, Siddoway) and gravity modeling (Miller) is used to guide 3D, lithosphere-scale structural restorations to test the compatibility of different components in our 3D geometric model. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the Bighorn Project partially lies in the development of fundamental methods for quantitative integration of geological and seismological research. In addition, the Bighorn Project involves a broad range of geoscientists, including one post-doctoral fellow, 4 graduate students, and >15 undergraduates, who will participate in IRIS and Keck Consortium sponsored research. The results have key implications for energy resources, allowing the prediction of open fractures that are critical to hydrocarbon production. The development of a dramatic animation showing the 4D structural development of the Bighorns Arch during the Laramide Orogeny provides important public outreach."

During primordial inflation there is a vast enhancement of quantum effects, which are ordinarily very small. These quantum effects can become so strong that conventional techniques for computing them break down. The main goal of this project is to develop new techniques for reliably computing these quantum effects, so that people can know precisely what they are. Another goal is to search for observable consequences of these enhanced quantum effects that may be masquerading as modifications of the gravitational force.<br/><br/>Such a study is interesting because many aspects of the current universe can only be understood, without using quantum effects, by supposing that cosmological evolution is driven by enormous quantities (about 96% of the total) of exotic mass and energy that has not been detected in Earth-bound laboratories. It is possible that some of the inexplicable features of cosmology are the result of quantum effects that became strong during primordial inflation. The broader impacts of this project lie in the promotion of teaching, training and learning."

For example, how should an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle decide between closer surveillance of a possible fugitive or intercepting the target who may be aware of the monitoring? Toward this goal, the research is identifying the sources of computational complexity and understanding the conflicting interrelationship between computational efficiency and decision-making effectiveness. This problem of individual decision making in uncertain multiagent settings is formalized using a recognized framework that combines the decision-theoretic paradigm of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with elements of Bayesian games and interactive epistemology. In this framework, called interactive POMDP (I-POMDP), the research utilizes innovative ways of minimally modeling contextual knowledge in multiagent settings, exploits novel decision-making heuristics and embedded structure in problems.<br/><br/>Integration of research and education is manifest in the development and delivery of a multi-disciplinary course on strategic decision making under uncertainty, which integrates and compares normative theories with real human decision-making behavior.<br/><br/>By combining aspects of decision and game theories, both of which seek to understand normative ways of decision making, with attention to real human decision-making behavior, this research is contributing to long-term research and development of artificial agents that can assist with rational, long-term decision making and planning in areas including emergency response, environmental sustainability, autonomous vehicles and many others."

The approach is to decouple the microfluidics, in which the actual bio(chemical) interaction takes place, from the transduction element, i.e. the mechanical resonator. The proposed sensor concept ensures high Q-factor operation of the microresonator, thus improving its short-term frequency stability and ultimately the sensor resolution. Moreover, the design simplifies the microfluidic interface, a channel with appropriate (functionalized) electrodes, thus avoiding challenges associated with direct exposure of a three-dimensional resonant microstructure to the liquid. The goal of the 1-year SGER is to fabricate the proposed sensor and demonstrate its applicability through: (i) chemical sensing of volatile organic compounds in water, and (ii) sensing of biomarkers based on antibody-antigen interaction. <br/>The intellectual merit of the research stems from the development of a new sensing concept for resonant microsensors, which decouples fluid interaction from the actual resonator vibrations. The research enables to apply the advantages of resonant sensors to liquid-phase sensing applications, which are normally plagued by large fluid damping and, thus, deteriorated sensor resolution.<br/>The broader impact stems from the availability of a highly sensitive microsensor with simplified fluidic interface for today?s liquid-phase sensing applications ranging from environmental monitoring to point-of-care medical diagnosis. Thereby, the cross-disciplinary research trains graduate and undergraduate students in areas spanning from electrical engineering to biology and medicine. Moreover, the underlying microstructures, namely miniaturized beams, are simple enough to be used in K-12 outreach programs to spark interest in science and engineering in general and micro- and nanotechnology in particular."

Novel experimental rheological techniques will be developed which will allow one to assess the theories for predicting long fiber configuration and orientation under well-defined flow conditions and to determine model parameters which are needed for the numerical simulations. Predictions for fiber orientation and configuration from a numerical simulation of molding operations will be compared against experimentally determined values taken from molded parts. This work is an extension of our previous effort on short fiber suspensions but requires the development of improved rheological techniques, extension and modification of theories for long flexible fiber configuration and modification of techniques for measuring fiber orientation. <br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will lead to an improved understanding of the relation between flow and fiber configuration and orientation for concentrated long fiber suspensions. From this understanding, theories for polymeric fluids containing concentrated levels of long fibers in which stress and particle orientation are directly related will be modified and improved. A numerical scheme for simulating the orientation of long flexible fibers in complex flows based on input from basic flow behavior will arise from this research. Information from the basic flow experiments will then be incorporated into a simulation package modeling molding operations, which will be made available to various companies (e.g. automotive, aerospace, etc.) and agencies for predicting mold design for obtaining parts with optimum performance. Graduate students will learn about the modeling, experiments, and numerical simulations of polymeric suspensions containing high aspect ratio particles.

At the extreme of macrofaunal change, ""dead zones"" are growing in number, frequency and extent. Ecological extinction is occurring in many localities before the functional roles of the lost species are understood even crudely. Subsurface deposit feeders dominate particulate bioturbation and control the burial of organic matter, the primary process by which carbon is removed globally from contact with the biosphere and locked away for geological time. Very little is known, however, regarding the mechanics, spatial geometry and selectivity of their food acquisition and their mechanisms of particle translation. The absence of that information effectively blocks the use of sophisticated, agent-based or automaton models that project deposit-feeder effects on substrata from ecological to geological time. Two principal obstacles have blocked understanding. One is the difficulty of making direct observations through mud. The second is a lack of understanding of the mechanics of the medium on the space and time scales of animal burrowing and feeding. Both problems have been greatly alleviated simultaneously, making this work possible now.<br/><br/>Physics of the medium constrain what is possible. They also determine in concert with other features (e.g., food quality of the medium) what behaviors and processing rates are optimal. The investigators have two simultaneous goals. One is to test hypotheses about how subsurface deposit feeders free particles from the medium that they crack, and the other is to measure the per-event and per-individual sedimentary consequences in the context of particulate bioturbation. They will systematically do so in the major polychaete groups of subsurface deposit feeders and opportunistically do so in other subsurface deposit feeders. Explicit hypotheses to be tested (phrased as the more interesting alternative hypothesis rather than the null) include: that crack propagation produces elastic-plastic deformation, mixing sediment at the crack tip; that crack propagation displaces particles gravitationally, that friction of animal surfaces with crack boundaries displaces particles; and, that unsteady flows in the burrow created by pressure pulses associated with crack propagation free particles from the matrix and displace them.<br/><br/>The broader impacts include a better understanding and development of updated diagrams for textbooks showing what seabed invertebrates do and how they do it. In addition, the investigators will work with COSEE-OS to produce compelling and accurate graphics about the role of bioturbation in complicating interpretation of the geological record and in gating the step in the carbon cycle that removes carbon from contact with the current biosphere. This outreach is designed to cover the spectrum of specialists and interested students of all ages who want to be informed about the ecology of the seabed and its role in global carbon cycling."

During the three-year fellowship, each postdoctoral associate will teach one course per semester at one of the undergraduate colleges and will be the lead statistician on a research team of statistics students and an investigator from another discipline. The undergraduate teaching will be overseen by the statistics faculty already at those colleges, while the research teams will be put together and overseen by the statistics faculty at the University of Massachusetts. By the end of their appointments, the postdoctoral faculty will have been mentored in teaching by several different professors from liberal arts colleges and will have participated in several different multidisciplinary research projects.<br/><br/>The mathematical workforce will benefit in several ways. Graduate and undergraduate students on the research teams will experience applied statistics through collaborative research; the postdoctoral faculty will serve as their mentors and role models for potential new career options. The postdoctoral faculty will be able to make more informed career choices after having been introduced to academic life in both small colleges and large universities. Modern applied statistics will be introduced to more students earlier in their careers and to faculty from other disciplines who might not otherwise become familiar with recent statistical developments.

Peterson, Robert D. Drennan, Lu Xueming, and an international team of colleagues will conduct three field seasons of archaeological survey and excavation in northeast China. They will investigate the societies of the Hongshan period (4500-3000 BC), which represent the earliest ""chiefdoms"" or complex societies in their part of the world. Monumental scale religious and burial structures in the Hongshan cultural core zone testify to dramatic social inequality and the presence of large labor forces. Multiple small regional polities are known for Hongshan times, but only in areas far from the Hongshan core zone. Direct evidence about the human communities that built and utilized the monuments of the core zone has never been collected. It is not at all clear, then, what these most developed Hongshan communities were like, or what social, political, economic, or ideological forces produced this development. Core zone communities may have been much larger than peripheral ones. They may have had highly developed craft specialization. There may have been wide gaps in standard of living between rich and poor families. Shamans or other kinds of religious figures may have been sharply set off from the rest of the population. Such characteristics have been speculated about, but in fact only ritual platforms and burials with elaborate jade carvings are known.<br/><br/>This project will focus on three different tasks in the field in order to collect the information needed to describe Hongshan communities. First, a regional settlement survey of 150 km2 will be carried out around the core zone monumental site of Dongshanzui. The survey will document the regional distribution of habitation around this central place and provide an indication of the community's population and spatial extent. Second, intensive surface artifact collection within Hongshan settlement areas revealed by the regional survey will identify individual household locations and yield artifactual remains to assess differ-ences between them in terms of wealth, status, and economic activities. Third, stratigraphic test excava-tions will provide better chronological control and at least a glimpse of the features associated with varied household artifact assemblages.<br/><br/>It is becoming ever clearer that early chiefdoms followed highly varied trajectories of development, and that comparisons between them can contribute to better understandings of this fundamental trans-formation in human societies. The information collected by this project will make it possible to place Hongshan societies alongside other chiefdoms for comparison.<br/>Beyond its intellectual contributions, the proposed research will have broader impacts as well. As a joint effort of the universities of Hawai'i and Pittsburgh and the Liaoning Province Institute of Archaeology, it will foster closer international scholarly collaboration. It will provide training and field experience for both Chinese and foreign archaeology students in methodologies not widely employed in China; and it will give foreign students first-hand exposure to archaeology in China. It will provide experience to local cultural patrimony workers in systematic archaeological survey, and the survey results will contribute to their efforts to inventory the cultural remains they seek to protect and preserve."

Internationally, reported or unpublished temperature measurements have been obtained at various depths and periods over the past five or more decades, and it is known that these temperatures have changed at different rates in different regions. Analysis of temperature measurements obtained in these boreholes provides historical records of secular surface climate changes (deep holes) and interannual to decadal changes in surface boundary layer (intermediate depths). The Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) is a metadata based system established in the late 1990s under the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) which currently contains access to more than 425 documented borehole and 165 active layer sites across both polar regions. In Alaska, two major series of boreholes exist within the GTN-P with observations dating back to the 1970s; the US Geological Survey deep boreholes (>125 m) and the University of Alaska?s intermediate boreholes (<100m). This effort will link approximately 80 Alaskan boreholes with sites of observations in other countries in Northern Eurasia, and in so doing will initiate the International Network of Permafrost Observatories (INPO). This work will coordinate data collection using standard equipment and protocols at the Alaskan borehole sites and at a selected number of sites in Russia. The Alaskan and Eurasian borehole temperature data sets will provide the baseline to reconstruct past surface temperatures, to assess the future rates of change in near-surface permafrost temperatures and permafrost boundaries, and to provide spatial data for validation of climate scenario models and temperature reanalysis approaches.<br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."

Determining the role of plants in affecting the fate of water from degrading permafrost is important for constraining estimates of evapotranspiration in models of soil moisture and energy balance. Preliminary data show that plant species vary in their ability to use permafrost-derived water. The objective of this investigation is to quantify new root growth into former permafrost horizons and quantify the use of permafrost-derived water by different plant species by comparing sites with and without permafrost. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of water from the active layer, permafrost, and plant stems collected in taiga ecosystems in Alaska will be measured. Bayesian inverse modeling will be applied to determine water sources used by different species and how they vary with seasonal changes in active layer thickness. The study will contribute to understanding the consequences of permafrost degradation and changes in plant water use for subarctic water cycling, energy balance, and potential feedbacks to climate. The proposed work is supported by a Post-doctoral Fellowship that will foster multiple collaborations and will enable the principal investigator (PI) to initiate her first full-scale research program in arctic ecosystem ecology. The PI will be trained in Bayesian statistics, ecology of subarctic ecosystems, permafrost and hydrological science, and science education and outreach.

The purpose of this research is to better understand how this heat engine works by focusing on the earth's lower mantle. The lower mantle is the largest region of the planet by volume and the heat sources and physical processes there play a critical role in determining how the heat engine works. In this project, we will take a cooperative approach in which we will understand the basic material properties of earth materials under extreme pressures and temperatures; incorporate those experimental results into three-dimensional simulations of the earth's interior; and then test the predictions of both approaches with detailed studies of seismic waves passing through the earth's deep interior. We believe that there are three areas in which our work will have broad impact. First, our specialized work on the lower mantle is of broad interest to the scientific community because it improves our understanding of how the earth works as an interconnected, dynamic system. Second, we will partially support and mentor three Caltech graduate students in the Seismology Lab. and thereby contribute to the training of the next generation of scientists in the U.S. Third, our multidisciplinary approach will allow our students to become leaders in the internationally competitive field of global geophysics.<br/><br/>Seismologists have revealed that the mantle side of the core mantle boundary (D"") is extraordinarily complex with a myriad of fine structure (e.g. ~10 km to a few 100 km's). Thermal and chemical heterogeneity, solid-solid phase transitions, and melting within the lower mantle are probably all required in order to explain observed structure and suggest that the lower boundary of the mantle is as complex as the continental crust. Understanding the origin of the fine scale structure of the lower mantle, in general, and D"", in particular, is key toward understanding how the solid Earth works as a globally interconnected system. In order to better understand this region from the different means available, this work will involve collaboration between a seismologist, a geodynamist, and an experimental mineral physicist."

Quantifying the uncertainty in the ocean component is important to understanding the importance of the oceans to the Earth's climate. Understanding the non-linearity of the ocean model's parameter space as exhibited by the resulting circulation will lead to improved representation of the<br/>simulated ocean and its deficiencies. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Complex climate models make use of parameters to represent aspects of various physical processes. There is uncertainty in the outputs from the lack of knowledge of the parameters used to represent the model physics. The best method of propagating the uncertainty through the complex and non-linear models is to use large ensembles of runs. This feasibility study will demonstrate a method using a relatively small ensemble of simulations coupled with an emulator to examine the effect of uncertainty in parameter specification on ocean circulation in a model. The parameter space of the ocean component of a climate model will be explored, focusing on understanding the uncertainties associated with a set of ocean metrics (e.g. transports, strength of the meridional ocean circulation, sea level, regional and global SST). First, a 100-year experiment using the ocean model of Community Climate System Model parameter space, will be conducted for a full ensemble of 100 (fewer if for a reduced set of parameters) at coarse resolution (3°). Then, the model output will be used to develop a set of ocean based metrics to examine the model's uncertainty of its parameter space. Finally, these metrics will be used to create and explore an ensemble of 10 runs at a higher resolution (1°) by mapping differences between two parameter spaces to make inferences about uncertainties at 1°. The proposed method is known as Statistical Analysis of Computer Code Output or Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments, rather than the classical method of Monte Carlo ensembles. These methods allow the use of much smaller ensembles, i.e., order 100 rather than order of a 1000 runs. A minimum number of simulations are required to span the parameter space in a designed experiment. An emulator, or surrogate, is a fast statistical approximation to the original climate model. As such, the emulator can be used, instead of the complex model, to efficiently span the parameter space to estimate the probability distribution and to address questions relating to parameter setting and metric uncertainty.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The funding of this research will have broader impacts. The investigator is a member of an underrepresented group within both the Physical Oceanography and the Statistical and Mathematical communities. As such, her participation in meetings of both communities will increase their diversity. The multi-disciplinary aspect of the proposal will allow for the cross fertilization of ideas. Further, this proposal would produce an unprecedented dataset that would be available to researchers and projects beyond the scope of this proposal for analyses of various ocean-climate and statistical investigations. Understanding the uncertainty in a climate model and the estimates of what the future climate might look like is critical to the public's acceptance of climate predictions. As with weather forecasts, the public and policy makers are better able to understand the risk associated with an outcome (in this case, climate change), as well as trust the information, when the uncertainty is known. This research will give the public and policy makers the information and to external researchers, the methods for determining uncertainties of similarly sized problems."

She will employ mixed methods, including focus-groups, structured and semi-structured interviews, and anthropometric measurements. The goal is to obtain anthropologically grounded information regarding recent shifts in behavior related to the emergence of obesity and associated health problems. Particular areas of interest include how urban women in Dubai cope with local gender role ideals; the increased availability of non-traditional, ""fast"" foods; changing work patterns; evolving ideas about body image, risk, and health; and conflicting messages about Emirati identity. The meshing of the biological and cultural is a pivotal aspect of the study and will provide a unique perspective on obesity and diabetes in the UAE, as well as on the impact of the globalizing and local processes occurring there.<br/><br/>The research is important because the World Health Organization estimates that by 2030, seventy percent of all deaths globally will be the result of chronic disease. Many countries remain ill-equipped to face the social, political, and economic repercussions of these increases in chronic disease. Although this study focuses on the local context of these processes, its methods and perspectives can be used to consider the effects of development-driven changes in other populations around the world. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist."

Species that are important from conservation, ecological, cultural, and economic perspectives may face decline and extinction in coming decades. Phenology, the timing of biological events, has emerged as a key indicator of species response to global warming and other aspects of climate change. Phenology includes the flowering and leafing out dates of plants, first arrival dates of birds, and other events throughout the year. The ability of scientists to predict how climate change will affect species and biological communities remains very limited, especially at the scale of countries and continents. Researchers in this project will study the year-round phenological trends since 1953 of numerous plant and animal species using data from 176 meteorological sites across Japan and South Korea. These records cover more species, a longer time period, and more sites than any comparable data set from the United States, and can be used to develop innovative methods of analysis that can be applied to species in the United States and elsewhere. At field sites in Japan, the researchers will examine ecological interactions, e.g., between plants and pollinators, to determine the potential for ecological mismatches among species with different responses to climate change. The U.S. researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students and will work with scientists from Japan, South Korea, China, and Europe, and the new U.S. National Phenological Network, thereby strengthening international connections among climate change researchers."

This Arabidopsis 2010 project uses the power of extensive biological databases to discover the function of new genes involved in folate metabolism. Folates are small, organic molecules that act as essential cofactors in conjunction with proteins to enable enzymatic reactions that are critical to all forms of life. Folates are involved in reactions that transfer one carbon (C1) units at different levels of oxidation. Despite decades of classical research on folates as cofactors in C1 metabolism, phylogenomics reveals unknown proteins in all kingdoms of life that are candidates for novel folate-dependent functions. This phylogenomics-driven project aims to establish the functions of two such novel proteins in plants and bacteria (YgfZ and APE157), to clarify that of a third (TrmE), and to advance use of phylogenomics in the metabolic biochemistry community. YgfZ proteins are often essential to viability and appear to have a role in iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster assembly or repair. A working hypothesis is that YgfZ removes C1 moieties blocking Fe/S cluster binding sites. This hypothesis will be tested by mutational, biochemical, and biophysical strategies in bacteria and Arabidopsis. Genetic and comparative biochemical evidence suggests that TrmE proteins facilitate addition of C1 blocking groups to Fe/S proteins. Mutational and biochemical approaches will be used to test this idea. Structural and genomic context information indicates that APE157 proteins functionally replace the crucial folate recycling enzyme 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase (5-FCL) by mediating a different reaction. For both prokaryotic and plant APE157 proteins, this hypothesis will be tested by combining genetics, metabolite profiling, isotope labeling, and enzymology. Characterizing YgfZ as a ubiquitous folate-dependent protein involved in Fe/S cluster metabolism would be a new departure in folate biochemistry, as would establishing a folate connection between TrmE, YgfZ, and Fe/S enzymes. Identifying APE157 as a widespread alternative to 5-FCL is an unexplored aspect in folate biochemistry of general importance. <br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>Although phylogenomics is a powerful and cost-effective way to discover unknown metabolic genes in prokaryotes and plants it is currently underused. To promote the application of phylogenomics in metabolic biochemistry, this project will develop a two-day workshop using the SEED database and its tools. This workshop will be presented at two major universities per year for the duration of the award to a target group of plant and prokaryotic biochemists, at PhD student, postdoctoral, and faculty levels. In addition to this wider outreach, this project will contribute to the training of at least two PhD students and two postdoctorals in the laboratories of the PI and Co-PI, and provide undergraduate research opportunities.<br/><br/>Data and information generated through this project will be made available through the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR: www.arabidopsis.org). Seed stocks and any unique DNA materials will be made available through ABRC. http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~plantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm"

Gaining insight into the function of these large molecular machines often requires detailed information regarding the motions and molecular interactions that are crucial for their biological functions. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool capable of studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules with atomic resolution. Building on previous work using methyl groups as probes for the molecular dynamics of supramolecular complexes, the target of this study is the 20S proteasome from the Archaeon T. acidophilum, a 670 kDa molecular machine with a focus on its ?Ò-ring proteolytic chamber, the dynamics of this region, and interactions between the proteasome and substrates. There are many fundamental questions that remain to be answered and that can only be addressed via high resolution solution studies. These include understanding the basic mechanism by which product is extruded, the mode of interaction of targets with the proteasome, including unfolded polypeptide chains, and structures of substrates within the antechambers of the proteasome prior to their translocation into the proteolytic chamber. The molecular weights of proteasome complexes can be in excess of one megadalton and new technology and strategies must be developed to answer these fundamental questions. Recently, new methodologies have been developed which utilize the unique spectral properties of methyl groups to address some of these questions. The major goals of this proposal are to (a) develop further the NMR technologies necessary for the study of supra-molecular structures over a large range of timescales and (b) obtain important biological insight into the function of the proteolytic core of the proteasome. This study is providing crucial insight into the biochemistry of the proteasome that builds upon previous structural biology by going beyond static three-dimensional structures to watch these machines in motion to monitor their dynamics which are critical for function. The approach facilitates the study of complexes comprised of components with binding constants sufficiently low, or are partially unfolded, that they cannot be investigated by other structural techniques such as X-ray or cryo-EM.<br/><br/>It is still the case that NMR applications are limited to rather small proteins and protein complexes. Since specific cellular tasks are often performed by machinery made up of large molecular assemblies, the methodologies being developed to study such systems are critically important. Given the unique ability of NMR to provide structural and dynamic information with atomic resolution over a range of biologically relevant timescales, the methodologies developed to study the proteasome push NMR technology to new frontiers of discovery."

In the past decade, compelling evidence that neutrinos have mass, and that most of the energy density of the universe is divided between dark energy and dark matter, has altered our understanding of nature at the fundamental level. The coming years promise equally exciting developments, with the LHC scheduled to begin taking data soon. This and other experiments will shed light on some of the profound mysteries left unresolved by the standard model. This proposal details the PI's plan to investigate theoretical ideas for addressing some of these mysteries. In particular he is interested in verifying whether evidence of Supersymmetry which unifies integer spin particles with ½ integer spin particles into super-multiplets will be found at the LHC. In particular the PI proposes to study (1) the possibility of using chargino cascades at the LHC to constrain superpartner masses, (2) LHC searches for the charged electroweak Kaluza-Klein states predicted in Randall-Sundrum theories with standard model fields propagating in the extra dimension, and (3) the phenomenology of supersymmetric theories with extended R symmetry. Models with extended R symmetry provide an interesting solution to the supersymmetric flavor problem. The PI proposes to study the phenomenology of these theories. This will include exploring a possible connection between neutrino mass and mixed-sneutrino dark matter, the collider signatures of the heavy gauginos and large flavor violation in soft masses expected in these theories, and the possibility of inelastic neutralino dark matter. The broader impact of this proposal is that undergraduate involvement is a central part of the PI's research program. Students will have the opportunity to engage in particle physics research, and through their work will learn important ideas, results, and methods relating to both particle phenomenology and theoretical physics in general."

It interacts with and influences a wide range of physical weather and climate phenomena (e.g., monsoon onsets and breaks, El Niño-Southern Oscillation, and hurricanes). However, the impacts of the MJO on the chemical component of the climate system are not understood nor even well documented. This project studies the MJO's impacts on atmospheric ozone and aerosols, two important atmospheric constituents. First, the investigators will utilize a rich set of atmospheric ozone and aerosol data from a number of satellite sensors and in-situ observations to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of intraseasonal variability of atmospheric ozone and aerosols as well as the dynamical and hydrological (e.g., rainfall, winds, and water vapor) patterns associated with these variations. Second, they will compare the intraseasonal variations of atmospheric ozone and aerosols between satellite/in-situ observations and chemistry/transport model (CTM) (e.g., Community Atmosphere Model with chemistry) simulations in order to quantify the fidelity of the CTM's representation of intraseasonal variability of atmospheric ozone and aerosols. Where possible, they will use the model and observations together to more fully understand the dynamical and chemical processes behind the intraseasonal variations of atmospheric ozone and aerosols. <br/><br/>This project will lead to better documentation and understanding of the intraseasonal variations of atmospheric ozone and aerosols and their connection to the MJO in both observations and models.

Available social-psychological literature allows starkly different predictions. Some research suggests that NES jurors may undermine jury deliberations; other research suggests that NES jurors enhance the quality of deliberations. Further, language differences (esp. English vs. Spanish) tend to mark differences between ethnic groups; thus, inclusion of NES jurors may either increase or reduce biases against minority defendants.<br/><br/>With the cooperation of the Supreme Court of New Mexico, competing predictions are tested in a mock jury study using jury-qualified citizens. The study varies the absence or presence of a Spanish-speaking juror who requires simultaneous translation by a professional interpreter. Second, the study compares majority Anglo or Latino mock juries. <br/><br/>Research results will have implications for jury systems across the United States. If NES jurors do not compromise the jury decision-making process, other jurisdictions may follow New Mexico?s model. The inclusion of NES jurors would ensure that defendants are tried by a jury truly representing their community?an important issue in states with high NES populations. However, if this research identifies problems associated with the inclusion of NES jurors, New Mexico may seek ways to overcome any shortcomings in jury decision processes. Other jurisdictions may learn how best to include NES jurors, if they desire to do so."

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is believed to be vulnerable to climate change as it is grounded below sea level, is drained by rapidly flowing ice streams and is fringed by floating ice shelves subject to melting by incursions of relatively warm Antarctic circumpolar water. Currently, the most rapidly thinning glaciers in Antarctica occur in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Sea sectors. This study seeks to place the present day observations into a longer-term geological context over a broad scale by high-resolution swath bathymetric mapping of continental shelf sea floor features that indicate past ice presence and behavior. Gaps in existing survey coverage of glacial lineations and troughs indicating ice flow direction and paleo-grounding zone wedges over the Ross, Amundsen and Bellingshausen Sea sectors are targeted.

The system will quantify evolving three-dimensional motion of organisms and fluid over a continuous range of spatial scales spanning five orders of magnitude (from 10 centimeters down to a micron) thus enabling the simultaneous characterization of detailed behavior of small fish, zooplankton, and phytoplankton or protozoa (species of three trophic levels). The system will also have high temporal resolution down to 0.5 ms enabling the observation of rapidly occurring flow events and behavioral reactions. Two state-of-the-art velocimetry techniques will be integrated to resolve the wide range of spatial scales. Holographic velocimetry will quantify small-scale motion of organisms, microscopic appendages, and the surrounding fluid (scales 1-100 micrometer). Simultaneously, tomographic velocimetry will capture and quantify larger scales (300 micrometer - 10 cm) of motion in the volume surrounding one or multiple organisms. The system will operate in a spectral range (near-infrared) to which fish and plankton are insensitive so that the measurement system will not affect or bias their behavior. The measurements obtained from the proposed instrument would provide unprecedented quantitative observational capabilities in both spatial and temporal domains. The instrumentation will permit the study of predator-prey interactions among fish, zooplankton, ciliates, dinoflagellates, and bacteria simultaneously within realistic environments. Therefore the data captured by such a system will provide opportunities to transform understanding of interactive behavior in aquatic environments. Hence, the system will lead to new understanding of the reasons behind variations in productivity and biomass in the sea and in freshwater bodies. <br/>Three graduate students and multiple undergraduates will be directly involved in the research. Also, the PI's will work with elementary school teachers and students at a school with significant Native American population to develop interactive projects based on understanding populations of plankton, minnows, and small fish in local freshwater environments.

However, even in a well-characterized organism such as Escherichia coli, the functions of nearly half of the predicted membrane proteins are only poorly understood. By the use of genetics to isolate novel mutants, the laboratory has acquired the tools to understand the roles of a previously uncharacterized but widely distributed and conserved gene family in lipid biosynthesis and cell division, the dedA family. DedA is a large family of inner membrane proteins found widespread in eubacteria and some Archaea. Genes for these proteins are also present in the genomes of certain green algae but have not been identified in other eukaryotic genomes. Currently, there are more than 1000 genes in the online database annotated as being dedA family members or possessing significant amino acid identity to E. coli DedA. To date, no function has been assigned to the DedA protein family. This is due largely to the inability to study the proteins genetically, as each single deletion mutant that has been made in E. coli is without an observable phenotype. A new temperature sensitive mutant, BC202, with alterations in membrane phospholipid composition and defects in cell division was isolated. BC202 has targeted deletions of two related dedA family genes (yqjA and yghB) and growth is restored by expression of either of these genes. YqjA and YghB have 61% amino acid identity so the proteins are expected to have redundant functions. BC202 is a powerful tool to study the roles of lipids in bacterial cell division and the functions of the conserved DedA superfamily of membrane proteins. The specific aims of this project are (1) to determine the lipid and cell division defects in the yghB, ygiA double mutant; (2) to determine the function(s) of YghB and YqjA; and (3) to determine the functional conservation of DedA family members from divergent bacterial species. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Results from the project will lead to a deeper understanding of the roles of lipids in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In an effort to enhance scientific and technological understanding, the results from these studies will be promptly published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Materials obtained, including cloned genes and bacterial mutants will be made available for broad dissemination free of charge. The PI is keenly aware of the need to promote teaching and training of graduate and undergraduate students and will train students in the research laboratory and also will integrate the research in instruction by including aspects of the project in his teaching assignment in Microbial Physiology. The PI is also committed to broadening participation to include members from underrepresented groups in biology in his research. The PI maintains an ethnically diverse laboratory and coordinates collaborations with faculty and student researchers from Louisiana State University and Southern University."

Kavich to work with Dr. Pietro Gambardella at the Institut Catala de Nanotechnologia in Spain.<br/><br/>This project examines the local electronic and magnetic structure of substitutional magnetic impurities in high-temperature superconducting materials. Magnetism plays a non-trivial, but elusive role in unconventional superconductivity. Previous impurity studies have concentrated on the macroscopic properties of the superconductors, leaving the impurities themselves an unexplored area and permitting their electronic structure and symmetries to be oversimplified in theoretical models. To address these issues, focus is being directed toward three key aspects related to a realistic description of the impurity, including determination of the electronic ground state configuration, spatial dependence of orbital occupancies, and anisotropy of the magnetic order in all major phases exhibited by high-temperature superconducting materials, i.e. the superconducting phase, the pseudo-gap phase, and the normal state. The investigation of these advanced materials is being accomplished using variable polarization soft x-ray spectroscopy, requiring state-of-the-art, ultra-bright synchrotron facilities. Temperature and field dependent studies are being conducted with both circularly and linearly polarized x-rays to map the magnitude of the local impurity moment and to determine anisotropies in the orbital occupancies and magnetism. In combination with experimental methods, advanced calculations using multi-configurational multiplet techniques, are being carried out to obtain a quantitative analysis of experimental data allowing for correlations between micro- and macroscopic properties of high-temperature superconductors and the impurity. The spectroscopic study of Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni substitutional impurities in materials such as Bi2Sr2Ca1Cu2O8 is expected to provide fundamental insight into their valence state and related local moment, settling a long standing debate about the degree of hybridization of the impurity states, and screening or coupling of their moment with the environment. Also, for the first time, the behavior of the spin and orbital impurity magnetization will be separately monitored across the superconducting transition temperature of a doped superconductor, illuminating magnetic effects on electron paring processes. Finally, by measuring the sample in different fields, we plan to determine the impurity-selective magnetization curves. These are normally masked below the transition temperature in superconductors by the large diamagnetic signal measured in standard magnetometry experiments. <br/><br/>This proposal promises not only to advance superconductor physics, but also to increase the fundamental knowledge of isolated magnetic atoms in a strongly correlated environment. The development and incorporation of superconducting materials into new and existing technologies is expected to have a profound impact on global environmental, industrial, and economic factors. The benefits are extensive, ranging from the improved reliability of the lossless transportation and storage of electrical energy, to aspirations of quantum computing with superconducting qubits. The fundamental research in this proposal is consistent with core aspects of long-term scientific research goals in the U.S."

It focuses on a series of problems in classification theory that are connected by the use of similar tools coming from singularity theory and the minimal model program. The project has three main objectives:<br/>(1) Investigate abstract properties of numerical invariants of singularities and their impact in birational geometry, and thus address longstanding open problems of primary importance in the field such as Shokurov's ACC Conjectures and the Termination of Flips Conjecture. (2) Determine rigidity properties of the birational geometric structure of certain class of projective Fano hypersurfaces, and use variations of these properties to introduce a new point of view in measuring various degrees of non-rationality. (3) Study different aspects concerning the behavior of curves on Fano varieties, especially in connection to the deformations of the variety and within the context of the minimal model program: expected deformation properties, if satisfied, would bring to light a rather surprising rigidity nature of Fano varieties. Other more speculative projects, notably one regarding a possible connections between Shokurov's ACC Conjecture and resolution of singularities via normalized Nash blow-ups, and one on the behavior of the Cox ring in families of Fano varieties, are outlined throughout the proposal.<br/><br/>The minimal model program, the main program geared towards the birational classification of algebraic varieties, is the general framework of the proposed research. Designed over the model of classification of surfaces (one of the main achievements of the Italian school at the beginning of the 20th century), the minimal model program has become one of the major trends in algebraic geometry, earning S. Mori the Fields Medal for is work on three dimensional varieties. Several leading mathematicians have deeply contributed to the program throughout the years, and very recently there has been some spectacular progress which is bringing us very close to a complete program in all dimensions. There are however many fundamental questions that still remain open, and some of these constitute the main objectives of the proposed research. A series of educational activities are also proposed: the range of such activities covers a large spectrum, from of high school students to peer researchers, passing through undergraduate students, graduate students, and young researchers."

Mantle convection is blocked by the overriding lithospheric plates and causes essentially all volcanism on Earth, in particular, the volcanism on islands that overlie unusually hot spots in the mantle. This study addresses two major problems in geodynamics: the origin of the base of the lithosphere and the nature of mantle convection at mantle ?hotspots?. Iceland is a huge volcanic island that is formed by a hotspot where hot mantle is rising beneath, and impinging on the lithospheric plates. The structure of the mantle beneath Iceland is revealed in unprecedented detail by seismic waves that traveled from distant earthquakes to be recorded on Iceland. The speed that such waves traverse the mantle is slowed by excess temperature and the presence of magma, and is different for different travel directions in regions where convection preferentially aligns the minerals of the mantle. On the one hand, the records on Iceland show evidence for a thick (>150 km) and broad (>600 km) layer of hot and partially molten mantle beneath Iceland, which suggests that the hot mantle upwelling is being deflected at great depths by a lithospheric base formed by a stratification in composition. On the other hand, contradictory evidence is revealed by a clear directional dependence of seismic wave speeds, which suggest that the upwelling mantle is being deflected at much shallower depths by a lithospheric base formed by a stratification in temperature. This study aims to resolve this contradiction by using numerical models to simulate, in 3D, the mantle convection, magma generation, and crystallographic alignment beneath Iceland. The investigators will then compute seismic wave propagation through the model mantle structure and quantitatively compare the predicted seismic records with the observed records. Tests of many of such calculations with different mantle properties will be used to identify the least and most likely conditions beneath Iceland. Determining the cause of the lithosphere and the shallowest depths of mantle convection beneath Iceland will advance our basic understanding of this system as well as other settings on Earth and other planets with active convection and magmatism."

Students are provided with classroom training and gain hands-on research experience using cutting-edge instruments, equipment, computers and technological infrastructure. Classes in computer programming and graphics, interface design, human computer interaction, and ethics occupy approximately 35% of the students'time. For the remaining time, students conduct interdisciplinary research projects in groups of three. Each group interacts with graduate students in the Human Computer Interaction Graduate Program under the supervision of HCI faculty. The research projects are presented at an end-of-the summer campus- wide research symposium in the form of posters, demos, and a five-page research paper.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/>Two major trends are driving research in Emerging Interface Technologies: a dramatic increase and cheapening of interface technologies themselves, and the ubiquitous permeation of technology into everyday lives. Correspondingly, research questions focus on what new interfaces can be designed and on people's perception, conceptualization, and usage of these interfaces. The SPIRE exposes studentsto four broad areas of EIT: information visualization, mobile/ubiquitous interfaces, intelligent agents, and enabling infrastructure. Because SPIRE-EIT has arisen from the ISU HCI graduate program, with 72 faculty across ISU's seven disciplinary colleges, faculty members compete to have their research projects included in the SPIRE and cite strong benefits from participation afterwards. <br/><br/>Broader Impact <br/>As knowledge work and adaptability to new technologies continue to drive global competitiveness, it is imperative for the US to maintain leadership in interdisciplinary technology-based research and training. ISU's HCI graduate program was developed in response to this need, and represents an ideal platform to host SPIRE-EIT. Both the HCI program and SPIRE-EIT recruit with an emphasis on underrepresented groups, preparing students for graduate education in the interdisciplinary area of HCI, an area of importance to the US economy. By including instruction on ethics and on research-based evaluation techniques, the SPIRE gives students skills that are useful lifelong, independent of discipline, and which students might not otherwise encounter in a traditional engineering or computer science curriculum. Because of the connection with HCI, the results of research projects can easily be incorporatedinto faculty members' undergraduate and graduate classes. Professionally, the SPIRE offers an impressivementoring experience for the participants because of the large number of graduate student mentors involved. The experience offers these mentors, in turn, an opportunity to practice mentoring for when they become faculty."

To date, a 17O-excess record has been obtained only on one ice core ? from Vostok. WAIS Divide is appealing for comparison with Vostok because it is located in a very different moisture transport regime, and will be influenced by potentially quite different changes in sea ice and atmospheric circulation. The intellectual merit of the work is that 17O-excess, obtained from the high-precision measurement of both 18O/16O and 17O/16O in ice core H2O, provides information highly complementary to deuterium excess which is used to provide useful insight into past climate conditions because of its dependence on evaporative conditions at the ocean surface source regions where polar precipitation is ultimately derived. Unlike deuterium excess, 17O-excess is independent of source temperature, and is only weakly influenced by fractionation during transport from source to ice sheet. 17O-excess therefore offers great potential, in combination with traditional measurements, as a powerful new tool for evaluating climate conditions in the past. In particular, it provides the opportunity to disentangle the effects of source humidity, wind speed, and temperature, local site temperature and fractionation during transport, on ice core water isotope records. The broader impacts of the work are that it contributes to the development of infrastructure and expertise needed both for glaciology and paleoclimatology, as well as for other research areas. A graduate student will work on both the method development and the analysis and interpretation of the ice core profile, providing plenty of material for a well-rounded and novel Ph.D. thesis."

Ramamurthy of the University of Miami will focus on the supramolecular photochemistry of a special class of supermolecules namely guest@host complexes. In the context of excited state chemistry, of the various organic hosts thus far examined, the octa acid (OA), a synthetic cavitand host, which forms a capsular structure that shields the hydrophobic guest organic molecule from the aqueous exterior, shows considerable potential. To establish OA as a useful reaction medium, the PI proposes to carry out experiments that seek answers to questions on the following topics: (a) Features controlling the stoichiometry of guest-to-OA complexes in water, (b) The dynamics of the OA capsule, (c) Controlled opening of the capsule, (d) The intra-capsular dynamics of the guest molecules, (e) Possible communication (electron, energy, and spin transfer) between encapsulated guest and free molecules present in water, (f) Selective orientation and conformational pre-organization of the guest within the OA capsule, (g) Influence products distribution through controlling the free space within the capsule. Topics (a) to (g) relate to the understanding of OA as a reaction medium and associated dynamics of the guest@host complex while (h) and (i) deal directly with the PI's primary interest of controlling photoreactions in restricted spaces. The long-range scientific goal is to develop, on the basis of well-established rules of molecular organic photochemistry and supramolecular chemistry, a model to predict the photobehavior of organic molecules in restricted spaces. <br/><br/> The research proposed by Professor Ramamurthy will help train graduate students on several aspects of modern organic chemistry, physical organic chemistry and photochemistry. In addition to providing excellent training for the students associated with the project, Professor Ramamurthy has long been involved in fostering international collaborations, disseminating scientific information through edited books and guest edited journal special issues (in addition to refereed publications), giving invited talks at national, international conferences and universities and organizing national and international scientific conferences. He also serves the scientific community as a Senior Editor of Langmuir, an ACS journal. The PI has used his expertise in photochemistry to collaborate on writing two textbooks, (1) Principles of Modern Photochemistry: An Introduction and (2) Modern Molecular Organic Photochemistry with N. J. Turro, and J. C. Scaiano. In addition, the PI is currently developing a course titled ""Being a Scientist"" that includes topics such as scientific temper, ethics in science, mentor-student relationship, choosing scientific problems, writing, submitting and reviewing journal articles and grant proposals, developing oral and written communication skills, quality and quantity in scientific research, influence of citation index and impact factor, and the role of a scientist in society."

This research project aims to discover the mental processes underlying their reasoning and to develop computer software that implements the same processes. There are two reasons for the project. First, the development of an integrated theory of reasoning elucidates a key component of human mentality. Second, a program that simulates reasoning is a major step towards fulfilling a long-standing dream ? going back to the seventeenth century ? of an automatic system for evaluating inferences and for identifying fallacies. The computer program would therefore be a tool for improving reasoning.<br/><br/>The theory underlying the project is that reasoning depends on simulating events in mental models. The project begins with series of psychological experiments to test the theory?s new applications to several crucial domains, which include how the meaning of premises and general knowledge can yield ?kinematic? mental models that unfold in time, how certain descriptions lead to systematic but compelling fallacies, and how the subjective probabilities of unique events derive from evidence that is not numerical. The experiments contrast the model theory?s predictions with rival accounts. Kinematic models predict a trend in the time to make inferences, because earlier events in a temporal simulation should be easier to access than later ones. The research then uses the experimental results and prior data to formulate a model theory that unifies the different components of everyday reasoning. The studies of subjective probabilities fill a major gap in the model theory and in the theory of subjective probability: how reasons yield numerical probabilities. The unified theory will be implemented progressively in a computer program, which will allow users to determine what follows from what. It will embody a mental architecture for higher cognition organized around operations on mental models. All the software will be in the public domain."

Specifically this work will compare two distinct responses, termed rapid cold-hardening and winter cold hardening. The first is an extremely swift physiological response that occurs within minutes to hours after mild chilling. This rapid cold-hardening response is ecologically important because it allows insects to continuously fine-tune their physiological function and organismal performance to match even modest changes in environmental temperature. In contrast, winter cold-hardening allows insects to survive extreme and extended periods of cold.<br/>This project will use a model insect, the fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis, to investigate changes in membrane fluidity and stress (heat shock) proteins that occur during cold-hardening. The role of calcium and calmodulin in regulating rapid cold-hardening will also be investigated. The results of these studies will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the integrated physiological events that enhance cold tolerance and allow insects to adjust their physiological performance to match changes in environmental temperature.

Windspeed determines the depth and the spacings of these circulation cells.

The specific focus of the project is on abiotic stress combinations and the genetic and metabolic networks that respond to stress combinations such as drought and heat, drought and salinity and salinity and heat. Abiotic stress is the primary cause of crop loss world-wide, with losses in the US estimated at 14-19 billion dollars each year. While abiotic stress is routinely studied in Arabidopsis by applying a single stress condition such as drought, salinity or heat, this type of analysis does not reflect the conditions that occur in the field where crop plants are subjected to a combination of different stresses. The central objective of the project is to identify novel genes, gene networks and metabolic pathways that specifically respond to a combination of two different abiotic stresses. The hypothesis to be tested is that dedicated genes, networks and pathways are activated in plants that are simultaneously exposed to two different stress conditions. This project is designed to bring Arabidopsis into the front line of applied research on abiotic stress tolerance, and bridge the gap between stress studies conducted with Arabidopsis in the lab and the conditions that impact crops in the field. The two key ""Broader Impacts"" of the proposed research are: 1) Development and maintenance of a centralized website that will bring together agronomists, breeders and Arabidopsis molecular biologists (http://www.ag.unr.edu/Stress_Combination/). 2) Educational outreach for K-12 and multidisciplinary training to postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduates trainees. Both undergraduate and K-12 outreach and training activities will target the under privileged and under represented in Science. Historically, abiotic stress combinations, such as drought and heat, had the outmost devastating economical and sociological impacts on the US, with losses of 48.4 and 61.6 billion dollars in 1980 and 1988 respectively. The proposed project will pave the way for the development of crops with enhanced abiotic stress tolerance, contributing to ameliorate the consequences of future weather disasters that are likely to increase in frequency due to anticipated climatic changes."

The project develops materials describing a disciplined approach to time-oriented programming that emphasizes the use of state machines for computation and the explicit programmer management of time, described in teaching materials including an online book and extensively animated PowerPoint slides. Recognizing the key barriers to focusing on a disciplined approach, the project develops a virtual microcontroller, which is freed from the complex details of modern microcontrollers stemming from legacy or mass-production concerns, and which instead possesses simple input and output pins and a basic timer component with an intuitive programming interface. The virtual microcontroller is supported by a single compilation, simulation, and debug environment, eliminating the complexity involved with setting up and maintaining microcontroller tools. The teaching material is based on the virtual microcontroller, and a set of online lab exercises is also included. For physical implementation, the virtual microcontroller can be mapped to a variety of existing microcontrollers or even to PCs or field-programmable gate arrays, thus decoupling lab hardware from teaching materials. Follow-on courses or labs can then introduce students to low level details of microcontrollers as appropriate.<br/><br/>The project's developed materials define and support the appropriate abstraction for disciplined time-oriented programming, exposing low-level resources necessary for a solid bottom-up understanding of time-oriented programming (timers, interrupt service routines, processor cycles), hiding minutia that detracts attention from higher-level concepts, describing a disciplined synchronous state machine approach. The coordinated materials enable any instructor to introduce disciplined time-oriented embedded programming into a computing curriculum as early as the freshmen year without concern for complex lab setups or of overwhelming students with low-level hardware/software details. The net result is that disciplined time-oriented programming methods can be introduced earlier and to a larger audience."

Different methods have been developed to characterize this interaction, yet these techniques require either high protein pair concentrations or imaging of the interaction. High concentrations often cause blurring in the final data. Therefore, to accurately determine the interaction between two proteins, it is important to perform both types of measurements.<br/>The primary focus of this project is to develop and to demonstrate an optical sensor capable of characterizing antibody-antigen binding at the single molecule level without relying on images. This instrument is based on an optical sensor that relies on resonance, somewhat like an acoustic tuning fork. The optical sensor is capable of single molecule detection, because as molecules bind to the sensor, the sensor?s resonant frequency changes, resulting in a fast response time (100ns) and improved sensitivity. <br/>This technique will enable new types of measurements that will have immediate impact on the fields of cell biology and biochemistry, with longer-term benefits to systems biology.

To date, interpretations of how organisms themselves have evolved, along with their key cellular and metabolic features, have relied almost exclusively on sequence-based phylogenetic reconstruction.  At the same time, genome-level comparisons continue to reveal new sources of bias that can mislead tree-building computations. As phylogenomic investigations converge on a single framework for understanding eukaryotic diversity, a universal ""Tree of Life"", it essential to develop new, experimental methodologies to test and extend computation-based hypotheses. This project develops an innovative approach to address one of the most vexing problems in comparative evolution, genomics and proteomics; that is, the origin of green plants and, specifically, whether they share a sister relationship with red algae.  Comparative sets of proteins that bind the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD), a key organizing platform for complex gene expression, will be identified experimentally in respective green plant and red algal models.  Phospho-CTD associated proteins (PCAPs) will be isolated and identified from the rhodophyte Cyanidioschyzon merolae and chlorophyte Chlamydomonas rheinhardii; both of these unicellular algae have complete and well-annotated genomes, permitting direct identification of specific isolated proteins through mass spectrometry. They represent, at present, the best system for experimental comparative proteomics of CTD-based transcription in the red and green lineages. <br/><br/>Broader impacts:<br/>As an example of how empirical approaches can be used to test computational hypotheses directly, this research can be transformative in the broader fields of evolutionary proteomics and genomics.

A cryogenic helium gas bearing is used to rotate a disc containing a drive mass pattern of alternating density under a small test mass mounted on a micromachined cantilever. Any mass-dependent force between the two will produce a time-varying force on the test mass, and consequently a time-varying displacement of the cantilever. This displacement is read out with a laser interferometer, and the position of the drive mass is simultaneously recorded using an optical encoder. Comparison of the measured force to predictions from finite element analysis yields bounds on new gravity-like forces which could signal new physics. The experiment uses several novel techniques to overcome some of the challenges associated with the necessary precision measurements that could prove to be useful in similar experiments or other areas. These include radiation pressure to cool a micromachined cantilever, the combination of encapsulated Micro-Electrical-Mechanical-System (MEMS) sensors with an integrated cryopump, the use of a macroscopic gas bearing as a general-purpose low-temperature motor, the methods of simple and precise fabrication of intermediate-scale metallic structures, and some of the techniques of dimensionally stable planarization. <br/><br/>While the Standard Model successfully unifies the electromagnetic, the strong and the weak interactions, it ignores gravity.

Long-term goals include enhancing the photothermal cytometer for use in three-dimensional imaging, developing photothermal multiphoton microscopy, and potentially integrating photothermal, fluorescence, and light scattering techniques. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary research involves mathematicians, physicists, electrical engineers, chemists and biologists, and will include developing a training program and new coursework on advanced optical imaging, animal <br/>models, and cell study in vivo to benefit the education of undergraduate, graduate, and <br/>postgraduate students at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and University of Arkansas at Fayetteville at Little Rock. Students from different ethnic groups from University at Pine Bluff, and disabilities (through Arkansas School for the Deaf) will be mentored."

When an airfoil is placed at a sufficiently high angle of attack, the flow over the surface can separate causing loss of lift or stall. Stall is usually detrimental to performance. Historically, the study of airfoil dynamics has centered on airfoils placed at fixed angles of attack. This view is insufficient to describe the physics of airfoils in motion, where the developed lift and the stall angle are considerably higher. Under these conditions the loss of lift can be abrupt causing rapid changes in the aerodynamic and loading characteristics. This phenomenon is known as dynamic stall (DS). This experimental study will develop a bio-inspired strategy to control or delay DS and quantify the velocity and vorticity fields in the critical region near the airfoil leading edge for finite aspect ratio airfoils.<br/><br/>Dynamic stall plays a key role in the development of two transformational technologies: wind power generation and the development of high-performance aircraft. It is widely anticipated that the Joint Strike Fighter will be the last manned fighter developed for the US Department of Defense. Removing the pilot increases the performance potential by increasing the allowable forces experienced during extreme maneuvers for which dynamic stall is central. Dynamic stall also results in high unsteady loads on wind turbine blades which, if controlled, can increase their performance and durability. The lack of experimental data for finite span wings undergoing DS hinders the development of predictive models and represents. <br/><br/>The PI's educational objectives include the development of new curricula for college and high school courses. Graduate students will gain experience by acting as mentors to the undergraduates who will enhance their educational experience through focused research. Students will be recruited from primarily under-represented groups using Clarkson University's pipeline programs such as the NSF sponsored S-STEM program. A senior-level problem-based undergraduate course in bio-fluid mechanics will be developed addressing the concept of biomimicry using the PI's research as a case example. A similar collaborative effort will be undertaken with a local high school. Once developed, these materials will be disseminated to other area teachers through the Clarkson University Office of Educational Partnerships."

The first one is a fundamental and basic intersection problem between the Hirzebruch-Zagier divisors and arithmetic CM cycles in a Hilbert modular surface over Z. The goal is to prove a beautiful intersection formula conjectured by J. Bruinier and the investigator. It has at least two applications. One is a highly non-trivial generalization of the celebrated Chowla-Selberg formula, a<br/>conjecture of Colmez on Faltings' height of CM abelian varieties. The second is to obtain a nice upper bound for the denominator of the CM values of Igusa invariants|refining a conjecture of Lauter. The second application is also practically important in Cohn-Lauter cryptosystem using genus two curves. The second project is a joint one with Bruinier They try to study how the CM value of twisted Bocherds products behave as the CM<br/>cycle change. They also want to find a factorization formula for CM values. Twisted Borcherds products are a family of canonical Hilbert modular functions with coeficients in the real quadratic field. The third project is to solve a general intersection problem in a degenerated Hilbert modular surface and use it to give another proof of the beautiful formula of Gross and Keating on intersection of three modular correspondences.<br/><br/>Broad Impact: Mathematics has always been essential to the development of science and technology. Now Mathematics has become increasingly important to business, finance, biology, and social studies too. Basic research in mathematics, which is usually `pure' mathematics (without application), has increasingly found unexpected and deep application in unexpected areas. For example, the number theory I studies used to call the queen of<br/>Mathematics, meaning that it is very beautiful and very attractive but useless in practice. But now it is extremely important in coding theory and cryptosystem, both are essential<br/>to our electric communication and electronic business transaction as well as our national security. Arithmetic and algebraic geometry which is also in part of my proposed research has now applications in engineering such as face recognition and economics. My proposed research contributes to basic and deep understanding of some arithmetic and geometric subjects in number theory and arithmetic geometry, and will in turn contribute to our society's well-being. One of my proposed project has direct applications to cryptosystem,<br/>which is essential to our national security and national economy."

These transitions are believed to be continuous quantum phase transitions (QPTs). The QPT is an important paradigm in contemporary condensed matter physics. A QPT, in contrast with a thermally driven phase transition, occurs at zero temperature with the ground state being changed in response to the variation of an external parameter. The fluctuations associated with QPTs are quantum mechanical rather than classical. Measurements at nonzero temperature in the critical regime can reveal these quantum fluctuations and can be used to characterize them. Other systems exhibiting QPTs include two-dimensional electron gases, compounds with strongly correlated electrons, and certain cold atom systems. The experiments that will be pursued will answer open questions regarding the nature of physical models governing SI transitions tuned with external parameters such as disorder, dissipation, charge density, and magnetic field, the nature of the insulating state, the influence of material properties, and the nature of the critical region, where new physics often emerges. The investigations will include measurements of transport and magneto-transport, electrical noise, the Nernst effect, and the electronic compressibility at the transition. The work requires advanced tools of experimental science including nanofabrication and ultra-low temperature physics. This project will support the education of PhD students and undergraduates in a manner that is excellent training for scientific careers from academia to high technology industries.<br/><br/>Nontechnical Abstract<br/><br/>Quantum mechanics is the theory describing the sub-microscopic world. Of contemporary interest is the nature of its role in the macroscopic world. Thermodynamic phase transitions are transitions between disordered and ordered phases. Their microscopic mechanisms are always quantum mechanical. In such transitions the macroscopic behavior, in particular the spatial and temporal fluctuations of the degree of order found near the transition, is classical. Quantum phase transitions are transitions between disordered and ordered phases, occurring at absolute zero. Instead of temperature, they are controlled by changes in external parameters such as magnetic field, pressure or charge density. In contrast with thermodynamic transitions, their fluctuations are quantum mechanical, and they persist at nonzero temperatures thus allowing their study. This project is focused on the investigation of the simplest quantum phase transitions, superconductor-insulator transitions in two-dimensions. The experiments that will be pursued will answer open questions regarding the macroscopic quantum fluctuations associated with these transitions and explore new physics that emerges near the transitions. The work has implications for other areas of research as quantum phase transitions occur in two-dimensional electron gases, compounds with strongly correlated electrons, and certain cold atom systems. The proposed experiments require advanced tools of experimental science including nanofabrication and ultra-low temperature physics. This project will support the education of PhD students and undergraduates in a manner that is excellent training for scientific careers from academia to high technology industries."

The research uses laboratory experiments to investigate betrayal in social exchange environments. Specifically, the experiments identify the specific effects that aversion to betrayal has on decisions about whether to trust a trading partner. This is an advance on previous research, where the effects of betrayal aversion could not be separated from other factors such as altruism, risk preferences, and loss aversion that also affect trust decisions. A separate series of experiments examines whether the disutility caused by betrayal knowledge acts as a check on trustees' willingness to betray and whether trust and exchange breaks down when betrayal knowledge is absent. The final part of the project investigates the motives for betrayal.<br/><br/>Trust and betrayal decisions are present in everyday economic exchanges.

They also have tremendous conservation value and support most remaining large native grazing animals in the world, particularly in Africa. A fundamental understanding of the factors most important for sustaining savanna grasslands, including their natural fire and grazing regimes, is required for their management and conservation. Scientists have questioned whether grasslands in different regions function similarly. Convergence in functioning would mean that ecological understanding and conservation strategies could be generalized for savanna grasslands worldwide. But contingent factors specific to a region, such as differences in evolutionary history or the types of grazers present, may lead to unique responses in some savanna grasslands. The goal of this research is to compare responses of key ecological processes to fire and grazing in North American and South African savanna grasslands. Scientists will take advantage of three ongoing, long-term experiments that manipulate fire return interval and the presence of large grazers. Responses of plant productivity, plant diversity and nutrient cycling will be compared, and the mechanisms underlying responses, such as differences in plant traits or evolutionary histories, will be assessed. <br/><br/>Comparative research elucidating the consequences of human alterations of fire and grazing regimes worldwide is needed to enable development of management strategies that can insure the sustainability of ecologically and economically important savanna grasslands. This research will provide the basic knowledge necessary to do so, as well as afford training and important global and cultural experiences for young scientists, graduate students and undergraduates. Finally, though collaborations that are already established, results will be made available to scientists and managers in South Africa."

In this research, we will model and analyze the variation propagation in periodic structure from the manufactured part geometry to its dynamic response and then to provide guidelines on mitigating the undesirable dynamic response via controlling the mean and variation of part geometry. The proposed methodology includes variation propagation analysis in two directions: (i) In the forward prediction, the geometry variation of the manufactured products is characterized based on dense measurements, and then the probabilistic distributions of the dynamic responses are computed. (ii) In the backward analysis, using the abnormal dynamic response as input, a group of local geometric features that, upon modification, can mitigate the undesirable dynamic response are identified. <br/>If successful, this research will positively impact a variety of periodic structural products, including bladed-disks in aero-engines and power generation equipment, cutting tools in high speed machining, and space antenna, etc. Through the collaboration with General Electric, this research will directly benefit a host of industries such as aerospace, automotive and manufacturing industries where these periodic structures are used.

Second, there are many opportunities to apply techniques based on topology to emerging models and problems, refining and extending earlier results.<br/><br/>In the near future, nearly all computers, from supercomputers to smoke detectors, will be shared-memory multiprocessors (often called multicores). As a result, understanding how to exploit this new-found concurrency is one of the central issues in modern Computer Science.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by EPSCoR"

The proposed activities will incorporate Web 2.0 technologies to enhance its social networking capabilities. A strong case can easily be made for the importance of SPN. For example, within a 24-hour period, the SPN pages are viewed more than 70,000 times by individuals in over 100 countries, and the SPN databases are searched more than 1200 times. Indeed, the PI's efforts with SPN were recognized with the Society for Personality and Social Psychology's distinguished service award. As such, the current SPN site greatly enhances the infrastructure of not only social psychology but of many social and behavioral sciences as well. The project will use Web 2.0 technologies to transform the Social Psychology Network into a fully featured social networking service designed specifically for researchers, educators, and students interested in social psychology. Specifically, the project will involve eight components: (1) adding options that allow users to customize SPN's layout as they wish; (2) developing SPN's eInterview.org partner site so that researchers can use it to collect interview data via the Internet; (3) changing SPN Profiles to a tabbed format that permits users to post multimedia content, upload files to store or share, and add new categories of content; (4) giving profile holders the option to link their profiles to ""colleagues"" and establish user-defined groups based on common research interests, career level, geographic location, or other attributes; (5) making it possible for site visitors to ""subscribe"" to SPN Profiles or request alerts that notify them when content of interest is posted in the Network; (6) setting up a community blog to hold discipline-wide discussions about questions of general importance to the field; (7) establishing a Collaboration Forum to help bring potential research collaborators together; and (8) developing an Application Program Interface that allows other programmers to create software applications for use in the Network. To complete the proposed work, SPN will hire an Associate Director with expertise in social networking, and it will appoint an Advisory Board to ensure that SPN meets the needs of the field and stays connected to other professional organizations. In this way, the project will not only fulfill NSF's intellectual merit criteria by advancing the field, but it will have broader impacts by enhancing the infrastructure for social science research and education."

The purpose of this Research Coordination Network is to foster a growing, dynamic, and predominantly young community of scientists studying life that exists in the dark, deep marine biosphere. The ramifications of this subsurface hidden biosphere are numerous and may lead to paradigm shifts in the biosciences and geosciences. To date, deep biosphere studies have focused on microbes in relatively shallow marine sediments or in terrestrial mines, wells, and drill-core samples. However, these data do not permit a true global census of subsurface life. The largest potential subsurface biome is also the least accessible: the deep ocean subsurface. This biome also has importance for global-scale biogeochemical processes, including the carbon, energy, and nutrient cycles. Depending on geothermal gradients and physico-chemical limits of life, the subsurface biosphere may extend to a depth of 5-10 km, or more, and occupy a volume several orders of magnitude greater than the continental biosphere. <br/><br/>The RCN will develop coordinate science activities in the community of deep-biosphere researchers. It will also promote education among several disciplines that contribute to the research through interlaboratory exchanges for students in this field. The RCN will meet these goals through meetings, workshops, student exchanges, and a web site. Additional activities for outreach include newsletters, web sites for information on tools and techniques, and special sessions at scientific meetings. The RCN will establish a research institute named DEBI (Dark Energy Biosphere Institute) that will foster the growth of research into the deep biosphere."

By combining physiological and anatomical assessments, it will be tested whether there is a fundamental relationship between the maximum rate of plant photosynthesis and specific anatomical features that may be determinants of the capacity of leaves' sugar-exporting (phloem) vessels. Sugar export may sometimes present a bottleneck to carbon distribution throughout the plant and thus to plant productivity. In particular, leaf loading vein density and the ratio of loading cells per exporting phloem vessel will be assessed in species with different mechanisms of phloem loading. If a relationship between photosynthetic capacity and phloem features can be established, these features will be available to: (i) identify plant species and varieties with superior photosynthetic performance and productivity; (ii) inform future engineering efforts directed at manipulating these anatomical features to enhance plant productivity. It will furthermore be established whether features such as high loading vein density are associated with enhanced productivity under dry conditions and/or cool temperatures. If such an advantage can be established, this will aid in the selection of plants with superior productivity in warm/arid regions that are expanding under global climate change and at higher latitudes and altitudes into which crop cultivation is expanding under the present global warming trend and where plants will experience seasonal exposure to colder than usual temperatures. The knowledge gained from this work will aid in the effort to maintain, and improve, crop productivity as well as carbon sequestration, which are urgent goals given the burgeoning human population as well as the current and projected impact of climate change. Furthermore, the PIs will utilize their existing connections to recruit students from diverse backgrounds into the proposed research and resulting publication/dissemination efforts as well as for outreach efforts. Lastly, the PIs are planning to continue their publication activity in venues reaching a broad audience including non-specialists."

One cause of this weakness may be overemphasis of lecture-laboratory formats. This project is seeking to improve students' scientific skills by applying innovative problem-based learning (PBL) techniques within an undergraduate training laboratory. Transforming undergraduate psychology curricula and education experiences through novel, inquiry-based instruction and training in scientific instrumentation is the long-range goal of this project. To achieve this goal, traditional teaching techniques are being combined with four PBL projects that were developed by faculty members with expertise in each of four research domains. Student groups guided by faculty and graduate student tutors are working through complex problems in experimental psychology in these four domains. Students' prior knowledge is insufficient to understand these problems in depth. Therefore student groups must use resources within and outside of the laboratory to understand each problem and to develop valid solutions. PBL projects encourage students to integrate the principal statistical and methodological components of psychological research in a hands-on environment. A series of written tests are being used to examine student performance in research tasks requiring semantic and procedural knowledge. In addition, several established PBL evaluation techniques are being used to assess the changing learning experiences for students and tutors. Of particular interest is whether PBL works effectively for both traditional and returning students. The expected outcome of this project is a series of lesson plans, complete with interactive tutorials for each piece of scientific equipment, which will be used to disseminate PBL to other campuses. Preliminary findings from the proposed PBL implementation will be used to encourage the continuing evolution of PBL as a flexible, multidisciplinary learning approach in other social science disciplines."

The theoretical frameworks used (causal model theory and causal Bayes nets) are parallel to those developed to account for rational causal cognition in humans and the development of these processes in children. Major questions include: Do rats engage in rational reasoning processes about cause-effect relationships? How do rats reason about absent events, such as hidden causes? What is the role of goal-directed action in the ability to draw rational inferences? Answers to these questions can extend our knowledge of the distribution of causal cognition among mammals and can lead to new insights into the cognition and neuroscience of self identity, freedom of choice and action, event cognition, and a theory of agency, all of which play a central role in how individuals reason. <br/><br/>The principal investigators also serve as faculty mentors in three programs for high-school students from diverse backgrounds in the greater Los Angeles area, providing the students with university research apprenticeships."

The system includes a newly developed Tactile Display Device (TDD) technology with miniature thermo-fluidic actuators that uniquely revolutionizes the way humans interact with different machines and systems using a wearable tactile display. The proposed new technology is a significant breakthrough as the concept of sensing touch actuation based on bubble formation and vapor pressure has a wide potential for miniaturization, embedding, flexibility, and wearable possibilities with amplitude and force of actuation not achieved by other means so far. The specific objectives of the project are to improve the actuator modules and the TDD developed during Phase I of the project, so that the technology can be brought to market.<br/><br/>The research will impact both the education and scientific segments of the market by addressing many challenges in application of bubble and vapor based motive power in miniature systems. Additionally, this outcomes of this work is expected to catalyze new avenues and variants discovered by the scientific community working in the areas of miniature actuators and systems, eventually leading to new innovations in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and in nanosystems. The research has very high societal impact potential as it addresses the blind population market segment that is somewhat neglected by the larger corporations due to its relatively smaller size. The blind population is not benefiting fully by the latest trend in information decimation increasingly through internet and computer based mediums. As these medium are highly graphic and visual in nature, alternate and enhanced interfaces with computers that use touch to convey information will be of great service and importance in making the visually impaired population more informed and productive."

Other measures include examination of activity in the spinal cord (in areas where nociceptive input is received), and blood-borne hormones involved in the stress response. One aim of the project is to better understand the factors that underlie variability in nociception, both between and within individuals.  <br/><br/>The investigators will study how the immediate presence of familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics (members of the same species) affects the expression of pain behaviors. The project also examines how physically, socially, and cognitively enriching housing environments (that include running wheels, toys, climbing apparatus, etc.) affect behavioral responses to noxious (pain-producing) stimuli. In a broad sense, this project will contribute to the understanding of how the brain modulates pain experience in response to stimuli in the environment. Researchers studying nociception in laboratory animals will gain valuable information about the effects of social and physical housing environments on these behaviors. <br/><br/>Another goal of this project is to understand how the expression of overt pain behaviors in mice affects other animals that observe them. Preliminary studies in a variety of species suggest capacity for a rudimentary level of empathy for others' pain, usually at the level of ""emotional contagion"". This project attempts to explore that phenomenon further, by assessing the social behaviors (i.e., approach or avoidance) in mice that are exposed to a familiar or an unfamiliar conspecific that is displaying pain behavior.

Bird, will undertake research on the social and ecological contexts of foraging, landscape burning, and habitat modification among Martu aborigines in Australia's Western Desert. Indigenous burning is increasingly recognized as an important force in shaping plant communities and biodiversity in the United States and around the world. However, the ability of scientists to directly observe the complex relationships between human culture and subsistence, climate change, and the patterning of fire is hampered by the fact that few indigenous communities have relative autonomy in burning. In this regard, Australia provides a unique research opportunity.<br/><br/>The impact of anthropogenic fire is considered to be particularly significant in Australia, where indigenous burning has been hypothesized to have radically altered the continent's biogeography. Furthermore, many aboriginal communities in the arid interior still have relative autonomy in fire application. Therefore, research that examines Australian practices will (a) inform models of fire management in similar arid regions in the United States; (b) illuminate the effects of fire suppression in contexts where anthropogenic burning has been a critical component of habitat structure; and (c) test the hypothesis that human impacts on the environment did not begin with agriculture, but extend to hunters and gatherers throughout human evolutionary history. <br/><br/>The researchers will develop basic analytical tools and collect new data to characterize how land-use and fire treatment affects variability in key components of arid lands diversity and habitat fragmentation. They will employ a variety of research methods including analysis of climate data and LandSat photos, detailed landscape mappings, focal follows of Martu individuals, transect mappings, and agent-based modeling. <br/><br/>The research is important because it will allow scientists to better understand how the interaction between land-use and fire may be mediated by climate change, how it affects plant and animal densities and distributions, and how, in a politically decentralized society, individuals overcome problems of collective action in supplying future benefits derived from burning. The project will also support both graduate and undergraduate education."

This project aims to uncover the causes of, and the paths to, the mortgage crisis from the experience of a major mortgage bank. The bank the PI's study is an ideal place for the study because it provides a epresentative and yet amplified version of the boom-and-bust cycle that the national subprime sector has seen during the past decade. First, the bank was one of the nations ten largest mortgage banks in 2006 and was one of the fastest growing. Second,it specialized in the reduced- and no-documentation loans that has been central to the mortgage crisis, while also providing full-documentation loans. Third, the insolvency of the bank in 2008 was one of the largest bank failures in United States history. Lastly, the borrowers and properties underlying the bank's mortgage loans have fair representations from all the states, and therefore, lessons from the bank's failure have general implications.<br/>The project will be based on a new and proprietary data set that represents the most comprehensive, detailed, and disaggregated data sets used in the mortgage loan literature. We have obtained data on more than 700,000 loans made by the bank that were outstanding at any time between January 2004 and March 2008. The dataset includes all the detailed information that the lender collected for loan origination, including loan pricing and other contractual terms, and the borrowers demographic and economic conditions. In addition, the dataset includes detailed information about the loan performance in each month during the sample period, including the payment amount and the loans prepayment, delinquency and foreclosure status. Finally, using the address information in the dataset, the PI's are able to match individual loans to community attributes such as school quality, housing price indices, and business opportunities in narrow localities.<br/>The analysis of this unique dataset will include several steps. First, the PI's plan to conduct a descriptive analysis of the evolution of the structuring and performance of loans originated by the bank during the sample period. Second, they will perform a predictive analysis of default, and analyze the differences in the determinants of default among subsamples partitioned by loan types and borrower characteristics. They will also analyze the time series variations of such. Most importantly, they will identify the two-sided moral hazard problems in the mortgage market. On the one hand, there is the possibility of predatory lending, where the lender misleads an uninformed borrower into a high-cost loan when the latter could qualify for a lower-cost alternative; or the lender makes a loan that will cause expected harm to the borrower. On the other hand, predatory borrowing points to the possibility that borrowers falsify or hide unfavorable information in their loan applications.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity: Using a unique dataset, the proposed study will help settle the controversies over lending practice, most importantly the presence of discrimination in loan pricing and predatory lending. The research also aims at identifying key factors in causing the mortgage crisis by assessing the relative importance of irresponsible lending and irresponsible borrowing. The novel empirical design to separately identify the opportunistic behavior of lenders and borrowers will also represent a contribution to the empirical literature on two-sided information asymmetry and moral hazard.<br/><br/>The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity: By conducting an inside study of a major mortgage bank through its expansion and failure, this work will provide a better understanding of the causes of the recent mortgage crisis. The findings will provide useful reference for policy makers who work on laws and rules in order to prevent a crisis of this scale from recurring. The lessons from this study will also benefit banks and financial institutions for better practices in loan provision and securitization, risk management, and monitoring."

In their senior year, students apply these acquired skills in their yearlong capstone thesis projects. <br/>Operationally, the project incrementally builds skills in use of E-Prime and BioPac technology. The training commences as students learn to integrate E-Prime programming exercises into sequenced laboratory courses, beginning with ""Research Methods and Analysis"" - a prerequisite for all courses included in this project.

In these settings, people come together to solve common problems--from policy-setting committees in political parties to informal gatherings such as a group of strangers working to free a stuck car from a snow bank. Frequently there are complexities and ambiguities in the course of reaching collective solutions, and so people in such settings look to one another for guidance. In the absence of more explicit knowledge, it is common for participants in such settings to make inferences about one another's abilities on the basis of observable characteristics. Previous research demonstrates that people use information on group memberships and status characteristics to form expectations for one anothers' task performances. Self categorization theory has focused on the effect that the cognitive aspects of group membership have on interaction, and status characteristics theory has studied how attributes such as age, race, gender and ability effect interaction. Although these theories share some common areas of investigation, to date there has been little overlap between the two. The investigators will conduct a set of experiments to test an integration of the two theories to study the cognitive aspects of group membership and the impact of social characteristics on members' evaluations of one another's task contributions. The experiments will test predictions that influence is enhanced by acting in accord with group prototypes or by being perceived as an in-group member and, further, that such effects can be countervailed by introducing information on certain other social characteristics such as education levels. <br/><br/>The research provides stringent tests and crucial data for evaluating the self categorization and status characteristics theories' potential for subsequent applications and interventions. This work builds on a nascent, integrative research program that expands the ranges of applicability of two long-standing theories in sociological social psychology. The research contributes to a new kind of status intervention, contributing to a body of applied research in school settings that has transformed classroom interactions--being an accepted member of a group is what counts most for increased classroom participation and thus learning"

The larvae of sponges, clams, snails, worms, etc., swim in the sea for various periods of time and then must settle in the right places to survive, grow and reproduce. In this way, both desired marine animals, such as those important to marine farming (e.g., clams, oysters, shrimp and lobsters) and undesirable ones, such as those that make up the fouling communities on boats, piers, and power plant pipes (e.g., sponges, barnacles, mussels and tube worms) become established and are maintained.

A typical seawater reverse osmosis (RO) plant requires 1.5 to 2.5 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity to produce 1 m3 of treated water; a thermal distillation plant requires five to ten times more. The principal objective of this project is to develop a new hybrid ion exchange-nanofiltration (HIX-NF) process that has the potential to reduce energy consumption of water desalination by two to three times for a wide range of feed water salinities. The proposed process is innovative in its approach for it partially alters the feed water chemistry prior to the membrane treatment. Specifically, it converts chloride, the predominant anion in salt water, into sulfate through a reversible anion exchange process without requiring any regenerant. As a result, RO membranes can be replaced altogether by NF membranes resulting in a marked reduction in energy requirement. Also, NF membrane is more robust and less susceptible to fouling compared to RO, the HIX-NF process has the potential to concentrate the reject stream further, thus reducing the volume of disposable brine. <br/><br/>The primary challenge of this research lies in engineering and perfecting the reversible sulfate-chloride anion exchange process, a significant component of the HIX-NF process. For every brackish/sea water composition, there remains a unique sulfate/chloride selectivity (i.e., separation factor value) for anion exchangers to sustain the HIX-NF process. The present body of knowledge on ion exchange fundamentals and our related work strongly suggest that by changing the sizes of the amine functional groups, the relative affinity between divalent sulfate and monovalent chloride can be greatly manipulated for an optimal process performance. In this project, rigorous experimental studies will be conducted with the three following feed water salinities to cover the entire range for the HIX-NF process: 6,000 mg/l, 12,000 mg/l and 30,000 mg/l NaCl concentrations. <br/><br/>Two graduate students (one doctoral and one MS) will work on the project. The P.I. plans to recruit one female student from the graduating class. The P.I. gives water related lectures in science classes of Freedom High School in the Lehigh Valley. Due to its global appeal, desalination will continue to be a relevant and interesting topic for high school students."

Ice ages will be determined by applying emerging methods for absolute and relative dating of trapped air bubbles (based on Argon-40/Argon-38, delta-18O of O2, and the O2/N2 ratio). To demonstrate the potential of the Allan Hills BIAs as a paleoclimate archive trenches and ice cores will be collected for age intervals corresponding to 110-140 ka, 1 Ma, and 2.5 Ma. During the proposed two field seasons a total of 6x100 m and additional 15 m cores will be combined with trenching. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is that the results of this work will extend the landmark work of EPICA and other deep ice coring efforts, which give records dating back to 0.8 Ma, and will complement work planned by IPICS to drill a continuous Antarctic ice core extending to 1.5 Ma. The results will help to advance understanding of major climate regimes and transitions that took place between 0-2.5 Ma, including the 40 kyr world and the mid-Pleistocene climate transition. A major long-term scientific goal is to provide a transformative approach to the collection of paleoclimate records by establishing an ""International Climate Park"" in the Allan Hills BIA that would enable sampling of large quantities of known age ice as old as 2.5 Ma, by any interested American or foreign investigator. The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include training students who are well versed in advanced field, laboratory and numerical modeling methods combining geochemistry, glaciology, and paleoclimatology. We will include material relevant to our proposed research in our ongoing efforts in local education and in our outreach efforts for media.

Documentary work is especially urgent for Shiwilu, since it is in immediate danger of complete disappearance with only a few elderly fluent speakers remaining. The award also supports the development of reusable software to aid in the production of scientific materials for the linguists and pedagogical materials for community members. The goals of the project include compiling and digitizing existing wordlists and grammar information, as well as the collection of primary data in the field through digital audio/video recording of consultants. The materials include: spontaneous texts, questionnaires, elicitation, and wordlists. The resulting corpus will be transcribed, translated into Spanish and English, analyzed and processed in order to produce databases, dictionaries, grammars, and text collections. Four workshops for community members are being held to raise sociolinguistic awareness, to encourage community involvement in the documentation, and to promote literacy in the native languages.<br/><br/>The project will capture a permanent record of Kawapanan and Amazonian cultural knowledge that will likely disappear in as little as one generation. A study of Shiwilu and Shawi may have a high scientific impact on the field as there is little systematic descriptive work on Kawapanan as a whole. It contributes to linguistic typology through the description of specific features such as a set of consonants unusual for the Amazon, classifier systems, highly complex verbs, and pragmatic ergative marking. Also, the project contributes to the reconstruction of Kawapanan, which will help to shed light on its possible inclusion in a larger family or stock. Furthermore, the project includes the use of state-of-the-art digital audio/video recording, and the development of open, reusable annotated data in Unicode/XML. All data will be preserved in a lasting archive for posterity. [On the technical side, the main intellectual merit is data re-purposing: the production of flexible data to serve the descriptive, computational, or theoretical linguist as well as the anthropologist, the language learner or educator.] The project responds to the demands of the Kawapanan communities, who are striving to preserve their languages. The resulting linguistic descriptions, workshops, and learner-oriented resources will be crucial to revitalization efforts.

Christian E. Peterson, Robert D. Drennan, Lu Xueming, and an international team of colleagues will conduct three field seasons of archaeological survey and excavation in northeast China. They will investigate the societies of the Hongshan period (4500-3000 BC), which represent the earliest ""chiefdoms"" or complex societies in their part of the world. Monumental scale religious and burial structures in the Hongshan cultural core zone testify to dramatic social inequality and the presence of large labor forces. Multiple small regional polities are known for Hongshan times, but only in areas far from the Hongshan core zone. Direct evidence about the human communities that built and utilized the monuments of the core zone has never been collected. It is not at all clear, then, what these most developed Hongshan communities were like, or what social, political, economic, or ideological forces produced this development. Core zone communities may have been much larger than peripheral ones. They may have had highly developed craft specialization. There may have been wide gaps in standard of living between rich and poor families. Shamans or other kinds of religious figures may have been sharply set off from the rest of the population. Such characteristics have been speculated about, but in fact only ritual platforms and burials with elaborate jade carvings are known. <br/><br/>This project will focus on three different tasks in the field in order to collect the information needed to describe Hongshan communities. First, a regional settlement survey of 150 km2 will be carried out around the core zone monumental site of Dongshanzui. The survey will document the regional distribution of habitation around this central place and provide an indication of the community's population and spatial extent. Second, intensive surface artifact collection within Hongshan settlement areas revealed by the regional survey will identify individual household locations and yield artifactual remains to assess differ-ences between them in terms of wealth, status, and economic activities. Third, stratigraphic test excava-tions will provide better chronological control and at least a glimpse of the features associated with varied household artifact assemblages. <br/><br/>It is becoming ever clearer that early chiefdoms followed highly varied trajectories of development, and that comparisons between them can contribute to better understandings of this fundamental trans-formation in human societies. The information collected by this project will make it possible to place Hongshan societies alongside other chiefdoms for comparison. <br/>Beyond its intellectual contributions, the proposed research will have broader impacts as well. As a joint effort of the universities of Hawai'i and Pittsburgh and the Liaoning Province Institute of Archaeology, it will foster closer international scholarly collaboration. It will provide training and field experience for both Chinese and foreign archaeology students in methodologies not widely employed in China; and it will give foreign students first-hand exposure to archaeology in China. It will provide experience to local cultural patrimony workers in systematic archaeological survey, and the survey results will contribute to their efforts to inventory the cultural remains they seek to protect and preserve."

The research objective of the proposed project is to identify the processes responsible for the survival and adaptation of biofilm microbial communities in premise plumbing. The research will be conducted by using community-level characterization of biofilm functional processes. This research will use a community-level approach combining high-throughput DNA microarray-based functional analysis and 16S rRNA gene-based molecular microbial ecology tools for the characterization of biofilm microbial communities in premise plumbing systems of distinct characteristics. <br/><br/>This research will provide much needed insight into fundamental processes controlling biofilm persistence which would enable the development of effective strategies for the minimization of biofilms in premise plumbing by targeting key processes that facilitate biofilm occurrence. Results from this work will also enable improved risk assessment, design guidelines and regulations for premise plumbing by providing much needed data regarding the impact of plumbing material, water use pattern, environmental factors, and water quality characteristics on microbial contamination in premise plumbing. <br/><br/>Improved understanding of the microbial processes controlling the development of biofilm in water distribution systems, particularly premise plumbing, will lead to more effective strategies to minimize microbial contamination of drinking water and enhanced safety of drinking water. This will lead further to minimized occurrence of waterborne diseases, increased use of public water supply, and reduced use of additional purification devices and bottled water. Our society will benefit through reduced heath care costs and more sustainable uses of energy and resources. In addition, the proposed research provides an excellent example of the application of genomics and microbiology in environmental engineering. Thus the infusion of research results from the proposed work into classroom teaching will better prepare students for learning and working in the increasingly interdisciplinary filed of environmental engineering. More importantly, the participation of minority students from a local urban high school in the proposed project will ensure that underrepresented students have the educational exposure crucial to their success in learning and working in the engineering profession."

Cerro Manchay (also known as ""Lote B"") is a settlement pertaining to an important regional archaeological culture known as the Lima culture. Poorly known to date, the Lima Culture offers an excellent context for researching aspects of sociopolitical transformation in Andean prehistory. Several prehistorians have argued for a major societal shifts in the this around AD 550 - 650, contemporaneous with the expansion to the coast of the highland Wari Empire, shifts that perhaps even represent the development of state-level society for the Lima population.<br/><br/>Cerro Manchay is a 1 ha site, located on a hill overlooking the Lurín valley and straddling one of the paths that connect this valley to the major prehistoric Lima Culture centers in the neighboring Rimac valley, an area now covered by the modern city of Lima. Preliminary work has shown that the site can be divided into four sectors: a zone of domestic architecture, spread over the top of the hill; a second residential area of agglutinated, irregular house clusters; a building composed of rectangular rooms delineated by open spaces that may be yards or plazas; and a rectangular compound with large walls. Each sector is spatially separated from the others, and each displays at least one associated, major midden or disposal area. Mapping and systematic excavation of residential, public and disposal areas in the different sectors of the site will generate the data on interhousehold variability in domestic architecture, household activities, and consumption, needed to understand the nature of status and wealth variability at the site<br/><br/>Research focus on community integration and household-level socioeconomic differentiation at the site is important because allow identification of changes through time in the postures and activities associated with Lima social leadership. The research also addresses some broad issues in the study of complex societies, such as the roles played by staple production, craft production, ceremonial practices and external contacts in social inequality. In particular, investigation focuses on determining if the increase in political centralization seen at the regional-level, was concomitant with the development of a new sociopolitical order at the community level. Specifically, the research explores whether changes at Cerro Manchay shows evidence for increasing: (1) economic differentiation (ranging from craft-specialization to staple production to wealth accumulation); (2) elite domination of ritual practice; and/or (3) elite emulation, in activities and stylistic preferences, of elites in other regions.<br/><br/>Beyond research questions of interest to social scientists, this project will have a broader impact by enhancing the level of public understanding of science in the communities at the Lurín valley, and fostering collaboration on study of complex societies between scholars from Peru and the United States. The inclusion of Peruvian students and local workers in the project, together with the experience of the author as Peruvian state-archaeologist for the area and current teaching responsibilities at a Peruvian University, is going to be the base for outreach to local, national and international communities, through conferences and preliminary informs distributed to school principals, community leaders, and local authorities. The research findings will be presented in Peruvian and international journals. The project aims to develop the site (and the work there) as a model of working with the patriomonio where archaeo-tourism is of increasing economic importance, and where the prehispanic legacy around the city of Lima continues to be destroyed by urban expansion."

The investigation will include a series of experimental studies. There are numerous theories that explain the gender inequality in CS. The main hypothesis of the study is that it is not the genetic predisposition or an unwillingness to put in late hours but the stereotypical image of CS that impinges upon women's ability to see themselves in the field. The research will examine the gender difference in CS as a function of social factors. A series of controlled behavioral studies will be conducted in which two orthogonal dimensions related to the image of computer scientists are independently manipulated: gender and stereotypicality (i.e., the set of stereotypes widely associated with the group, such as affinity for video games and social awkwardness). These will be conducted across three domains through which stereotypes of CS are communicated: the media, classroom environments, and peer interactions. <br/>The study's findings will have impacts on STEM fields which are looking to increase their diversity. The impact of stereotypes across three age groups (college, high school, and middle schools students) will be tested. The study will lead to the development of a virtual psychology laboratory that can be used well beyond the project duration to study stereotypes. One primary goal of this study is to disseminate findings broadly to schools, universities and the general public so more positive educational environments can be developed to nuture the interest and aspirations of women to enter the STEM fields."

A combination of satellite remote sensing and numerical modeling will be used to investigate both past and ongoing patterns of change. New high-resolution surface elevation maps made from a novel combination of satellite laser altimetry and remotely observed surface shape provide a unique view of grounding zones. These data will be used to diagnose events associated with the shutdown of Kamb Ice Stream, to investigate a recent discharge event on Institute Ice Stream and to investigate ongoing change at the outlet of Whillans Ice Stream, along with other modern processes around the West Antarctic. An existing numerical model of coupled ice sheet, ice stream, and ice shelf flow will be used and improved as part of the research project. The broader impacts of the project relate to the importance of understanding the role of polar ice sheets in global sea level rise. The work will contribute to the next round of deliberations for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Improved views, interpretations, and insights into the physical processes that govern variability in ice sheet outlet streams will help correct the shortcomings of the last IPCC report that didn?t include the role of ice sheets in sea level rise.

The proposal seeks funding to continue investigations of remarkable properties of the Ross Ice Shelf near McMurdo Station, Antarctica, for the detection of neutrinos as they cause radio emission upon their rare collisions with the atomic nuclei in the ice. The ice sheet is impressively transparent to electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies and the water-ice boundary below the shelf behaves like a good mirror to reflect radio signals from neutrino interactions in any downward direction. These properties were confirmed in recent studies of the at Moore?s Bay through the NSF's SGER award. Moreover, it was found that the background noise level at this site is quite modest in the frequency band of interest. Simulations show excellent energy and angular resolution if the full array of radio detectors will be built - because the events are typically contained within the ice beneath the surface stations. It is proposes to take the next logical step toward the realization of the ARIANNA array concept by designing, constructing, and deploying two autonomous detector stations at the site to assess the overall array large-scale feasibility, system robustness, and the ambient noise environment over an extended period of time. Each station consists of eight linearly polarized antennas residing just beneath the snow surface, oriented downwards and arranged in an octagon with ~6m diameter. Nearby Minna Bluff range protects the site from significant anthropogenic radio noise coming from McMurdo Station. At the same time, the site's close proximity to McMurdo provides a number of suitable options for logistical support. Continued reliance on students provides a broader impact of this proposed research and firmly grounds this effort in its educational mission."

Media multitasking is a growing phenomenon observed among 8-18 year olds, yet little is known regarding how this behavior influences key cognitive, developmental and behavioral processes which affect the way young people learn, reason, socialize, think creatively, and understand the world. Previous research in the adult population generally shows that media multitasking negatively impacts productivity. However, little research to date has examined the processes underlying children's media multitasking or how such processes may affect cognitive development and learning. <br/><br/>Clifford Nass of the Stanford CHIMe Lab and Roy Pea, Co-PI of the NSF LIFE (Learning in Informal and Formal Environments) Center, in partnership with the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop, will convene a symposium for an interdisciplinary group of leading scholars from neuroscience, child development, cognitive, communication, and education fields, and key policy leaders to advance our understanding of the potential implications of media multitasking for learning and cognitive development in children and youth. The primary goal of the symposium is to define a coherent agenda to stimulate needed theory-based research on the implications of media multitasking for learning and cognitive development. The symposium will consist of three panels of multi-disciplinary experts to examine: a) media multitasking and cognitive development, b) media multitasking, learning and productivity, and c) design principles for leveraging media multitasking in educational contexts. A meeting report will be distributed on the symposium website and in print form. The symposium website will also facilitate communication and knowledge sharing among a newly defined research community and serve as a clearinghouse for information on the implications of media multitasking for cognitive development and learning. Overall, the activities associated with this grant will help activate a new special interest academic community, and encourage and facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration across institutional, intellectual and methodological disciplines. Through understanding how media multitasking may affect psychological processes underlying learning and cognition, practitioners will be better prepared to inform policy and to maximize educational impact in a broad range of learning contexts."

In monkeys and apes the canines are typically relatively large and participate in a functional complex that sharpens the canines during occlusion; the reduced hominin canine is not sharpened. Characters within functional complexes are expected to coevolve as a result of natural selection and, among nonhuman anthropoid primates, two characters of this complex have been shown to be correlated among species, suggesting that characters of the complex do coevolve. A similar pattern is not observed in early hominins of the genus Australopithecus. Thus, the canine honing complex provides a rare opportunity to investigate the coevolution and dissolution of a functional complex.<br/> Character coevolution occurs as the result of different processes; for example, characters may coevolve because of genetic correlations, created by pleiotropy or genetic linkage, which exist among characters. Coevolution, observed among species, is in this case an extension of the genetic relationship that exists within species. Coevolution occurs in the absence of genetic correlations as well if characters respond independently to selection, which is termed selective covariation. This project will determine if characters of the honing complex coevolve and, if so, by which process. Genetic correlations in nonhuman primates would require a genetic decoupling of the complex during hominin evolution; however, the absence of genetic correlations would only require a change in the source or strength of selective pressures to break up the complex. By examining patterns of covariation, both within and among species, the process(es) that holds the complex together in extant nonhuman anthropoids will be elucidated as will be the process that decoupled the complex in hominins. This project will investigate the origin of canine reduction, one of the hallmark features of hominin evolution. To address this topic, the morphology of the primate dentition will be quantified using caliper- and photographic-based measurements. Measurements will be taken on a broad sample of primate dentitions to ensure that the sample is broad phylogenetically, in body size, and in social structure."

The principle aim of this program is to help graduate fellows make the critical transition from student to scientist by asking them to identify the conceptual underpinnings of their field in order to develop outreach materials related to their research. Graduate fellows then teach these underlying concepts to teachers and students, thereby helping the fellows to develop the science communication skills that are essential for their future as interdisciplinary researchers and citizen/scientists. At the core of the program is the ?collaborative curriculum development? project: Graduate fellows will work with a teacher and faculty advisor during a six-week summer program on the development of innovative, inquiry-driven science education activities related to the fellow?s research, which will then be implemented in underserved rural and urban schools during the following year. In addition to graduate fellows becoming more conceptually-oriented scientific thinkers with better science communication skills, the participating teachers will improve their science knowledge and receive help implementing best-practice science teaching methods, while students will receive enhanced science education. In particular, the inquiry-driven activities will let students experience science not as an abstract collection of facts from separate fields, but as a process for discovery that integrates knowledge across disciplines, thereby increasing student understanding of and interest in science.<br/>"

In all languages, pitch (as one aspect of speech prosody) can express attitude or emotion. In some languages, like English, pitch patterns, usually called intonation contours, also express distinctions such as that between a question and a statement. In languages like Mandarin Chinese, on the other hand, pitch patterns called tones go still further to signal differences between words that are otherwise identical. Despite significant advances in recent decades, a unified theoretical account of the linguistic phenomena called tone and intonation remains elusive in crucial respects. In fact, there is still no universal agreement even over how best to characterize the formal properties of intonation contours in languages like English. What seems to be missing is a common acoustic or articulatory vocabulary for the expression of the relevant distinctions, a single measurable dimension within which contours can be reliably distinguished regardless of the language under investigation. This project develops a new mathematical approach, based on the notion of Tonal Center of Gravity, to characterizing pitch distinctions in English. This approach reconciles seemingly contradictory results from the experimental literature on the perception of contrasting pitch contours. Our research will concentrate on a small number of intonation contours from English, and will test the applicability of our model in two kinds of experiments. The first involves automatic classification of pitch contours recorded from native speakers in an experimental setting. The second involves direct manipulation through speech synthesis of a number of the physical characteristics of pitch contours that might be involved in conveying speakers' intentions, to see which variables have the greatest effect on listeners' judgments of utterance meaning.<br/><br/>The project lays the groundwork for a unified approach to the production and perception of tonal contrasts in human language, one that expresses how systems differ, while capturing the deeper commonality among languages at the same time. The results of this work will also have a broader impact in the area of speech technology. For example, identifying the perceptually relevant characteristics of distinct intonation patterns will allow for greater realism in speech synthesis systems. In addition, being able to distinguish automatically between similar but perceptually distinct contours will allow automatic pronunciation training systems to give more helpful feedback to second language learners. Finally, this new model will facilitate automatic categorization of intonation contours for speech understanding systems. Progress in this area will ultimately allow such systems to derive meaning not just from the sequence of words in an utterance, but from the subtle meaning differences conveyed by intonation as well."

Water, in particular, is fundamental to life. Yet despite this, several of its properties and those of liquids, in general, are still not well understood. This is especially true when the liquid samples are confined to spaces whose spatial dimensions are on the nanoscale. Here, water has been found to exhibit many interesting and novel features including the manifestation of ice phases, not typically seen in bulk samples and exhibition of solid-like orderedness. Thin nanometer layers of water between two surfaces are responsible for every day experiences with friction and are behind many of the phenomena seen in tribology. Nanoscale water also plays an essential role in biological processes such as protein folding and enzyme activation. Unfortunately, due to the short-range order of bulk water and constant agitation of water molecules, these features prove difficult to investigate under most circumstances. In recent years, advances in nanotechnology have allowed for the fabrication and probing of systems on increasingly smaller length scales. Such advances have provided the means to study liquid samples on the nanoscale. Recent work by Prof. Wonho Jhe at Seoul National University examined the formation of nanoscale water columns in small spaces using an atomic force microscope. These studies have shown that nanoscale water samples actually possess elastic properties; a feature obscured by the viscous properties observed in bulk water samples. This research focuses on experimentally probing the properties of nanoscale liquid columns, specifically water. This is done by combining two experimental techniques to measure both the force gradient and the force exerted by the nanoscale water columns. The first technique involves measuring the force gradient operated via the small amplitude-modulated method using an atomic force microscope. The second uses a sensitive microelectromechanical (MEMS) force sensor to measure the forces exerted by the columns. <br/><br/>The combination of the two techniques provides a novel scheme for studying several features of the nanoscale water columns that are formed between the atomic force microscope?s cantilever and the MEMS force sensor. The specific features include the impact of humidity on the adhesive force, the elasticity and viscosity of water, and the relaxation and nucleation time of capillary condensation. These results will contribute to our understanding of the role nanoscale water can play in biological processes and of the effect the adhesive force has on the performance of scanning probe microscopy and MEMS."

Nairne<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Our capacity to remember is certainly the product of an extended period of evolution. Yet if human memory evolved, sculpted by the processes of natural selection, then its processes likely bear the ""footprints"" of ancestral selection pressures. In particular, our memory systems should be ""tuned"" to retain information that is fitness-relevant, pertaining to survival and reproduction. Until recently, psychologists have ignored this possibility, but work in the researcher's laboratory has shown that thinking about the survival relevance of information leads to superior long-term memory -- better, in fact, than virtually all known study techniques. As one example, asking experimental participants to rate a list of arbitrarily selected words for each item's potential survival value leads to significantly higher rates of recall and recognition than traditional study procedures (e.g., even effective techniques such as rating items for pleasantness or forming a visual image). Still, the psychological mechanisms that underlie fitness-relevant memory processing remain essentially unknown and largely unexplored. Do we have special memory mechanisms designed to retain fitness-relevant information? Are these mechanisms rooted in the remnants of a stone-age brain? Our research explores these questions by comparing and contrasting how memory operates in fitness-relevant and fitness-irrelevant situations. The research investigates memory's role in the formation of social contracts as well, and in the processing of prospective mating partners. Do people have special memory mechanisms for retaining information about people who cheat, perform altruistic acts, and for potential mates? Answers to these questions will be determined by having people imagine themselves in fitness-relevant situations, such as seeking food or a prospective mate, followed by the administration of diagnostic retention tests. Previous work suggests that the study of adaptive memory may lead to a fundamental reconceptualization of basic memory mechanisms: Rather than general processes designed to operate the same way in all environments, memory's operating characteristics may well vary depending on the particular problem context. <br/><br/>To understand how memory works, and to develop effective techniques for memory improvement, it is essential to understand the function of memory and, more specifically, to understand how and why memory evolved. Memory likely evolved to help us solve adaptive problems, such as finding food, avoiding predators, or attracting prospective mates. Recognizing the adaptive roots of memory is key to understanding its basic mechanisms, just as understanding the adaptive function of the heart or the liver is vital to understanding their ultimate structure. The researcher's research systematically explores the function of memory in fitness-relevant contexts, such as the search for food, the avoidance of predators, or in assessing the trustworthiness of potential cheaters. Understanding how memory is used to solve the problems of survival, the formation of social contracts, and reproduction will provide critical insight into how and why memory systems formed, and why they work the way they do. As our understanding of memory's inherent ""tunings"" increases, our ability to calibrate our learning strategies, and to teach others to remember effectively, will increase as well. For example, educators commonly promote study strategies based on the processing of meaning, or ""visualizing"" the material, whereas the researcher has shown that a few seconds of focused adaptive processing (i.e., how is the material relevant to survival or dealing with significant others) produces substantially better long-term retention."

The proposal seeks limited funds to develop the capability of the Berkeley Geochronology Center to measure the stable cosmogenic nuclide 21Ne, and to use this capability to measure 21Ne concentrations in an existing set of bedrock and sediment samples from the Antarctic Dry Valleys (DV). These samples were collected during two previous Antarctic field seasons and concentrations of the cosmogenic radionuclides 26Al and 10Be was measured in order to determine whether the observed antiquity of DV surface sediments and landforms was the result of vanishingly small erosion and degradation rates or of long periods of cover by cold-based glaciers. If the former hypothesis is confirmed, measure the degradation rates of these processes. These results quantify existing stratigraphic observations that many DV landscape surfaces are very old and erode very slowly. One consequence of the results is that, unlike in most environments worldwide where relatively rapid surface erosion limits the period about which cosmogenic-nuclide measurements can provide information, surfaces in the DV are sufficiently stable that the factor governing this time scale is not surface erosion, but the radioactive decay of 26Al and 10Be. The research results will have important implications in understanding Antarctic ice sheet and climate evolution."

Volcanic arcs represent a complex blend produced from pre-existing crustal basement, subducting slab and adjacent mantle reservoirs. Although temporal variations in arc magmatic outfluxes (compositions and volumes) must somehow be coupled to secular changes of the Earth's surface and mantle reservoirs, it remains unclear how they vary with subduction dynamics (crustal thickness, slab dip, convergence rate etc.). This project aims to investigate the causes of the variable magmatic outflux of the Mariana arc in the NW Pacific. The Mariana arc/backarc system is part of the intra-oceanic Izu Bonin-Mariana (IBM) arc that initiated ~49 million years ago. It is well known for its variable K2O-enrichment over time at rates that match to secular geological change. To understand what forces such Mariana 'fluctuations', it is proposed to determine chemical variations in Mariana volcanic rocks from the mid-Oligocene to Recent time. This rock record is preserved by tephra deposits in the marine sediments with high temporal precision and resolution (~1 Ma). While the lavas of the early (~32-48 Ma) and present-day arc (<1 Ma) provide an essential framework, only the tephras provide comprehensive information on the crucial intermediate period of arc evolution. Fresh volcanic particles (glasses, scoria, pumice, juvenile lithics) from the fraction >35 _m will be separated from minimally altered tephra layers, and these samples will be analyzed for Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope ratios and major and trace elements of fresh volcanic glasses and particles.<br/>The project bears on one of the fundamental science themes of the Subduction Factory Initiative: 'How do forcing functions such as convergence rate and upper plate thickness regulate production of magma and fluid from the Subduction Factory?'. On a regional scale, the new data will fill an important gap in the overall evolution of the IBM system that will provide new perspectives on the evolution of the IBM convergent margin. On a global scale, the study of secular arc evolution will aid in the understanding how the Earth's reservoirs interact, and how this may be linked to arc magmatic fluxes and global environmental change.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The project will promote scientific partnership between U.S. and Australian scientists. The support for women in the geosciences will be furthered. Straub is a female researcher with a disability who has already made substantial contributions to the IBM evolution as part of a long-held goal of her research. Straub will produce an online MARGINS mini-lesson to share her expertise on the use of tephras as petrogenetic tool. It is planned to involve undergraduate students in this project research."

This research uses a risk assessment model to identify the processes underlying executive advancement and consider how these processes operate to create very different outcomes for men and women. Several key propositions of this risk assessment model will be tested through two experimental lab studies. The first study is an experiment aimed at determining 1) whether decision makers attribute higher risk to hiring or promoting individuals that are perceived as less competent, congruent, committed and credible; and 2) whether women are perceived as less qualified on each of these dimensions than men with objectively identical qualifications, and as a result are seen as carrying higher risk in hire and promotion decisions than men.  The second study is a series of four identical experiments with varying participants (undergraduates, MBAs, executive MBAs and executives) aimed at testing whether greater perceived risk is attributed to hiring women than men and whether this higher perceived risk translates to women being hired and promoted less frequently.<br/><br/>The research question being addressed in this project is a complex one, as the phenomenon is likely driven by multiple processes operating simultaneously to disadvantage women. Unlike most previous work, this project takes a systemic approach appropriate to the problem by simultaneously considering the impact of perceptions of competence, congruence, commitment and credibility upon risk perceptions and hiring decisions. As a result, the research will clarify not just whether women are perceived as riskier than men, but also why.  Further, by integrating research from the fields of both gender studies and risk and decision-making, this research takes a novel approach that may make the development of policies aimed at reducing gender inequality more tractable.  Most business organizations are adept at making risk/reward tradeoffs and decisions across many contexts. By enabling organizations to see gender inequality through a lens with which they are familiar, this project may help them to develop and enact more effective policies in their efforts to create gender equality.<br/><br/>"

For example, English speakers may use an active or a passive. They are more likely to choose a passive over an active if the patient, but not the agent, is human and hence more accessible (""The girl was struck by lightning""). Such accessibility effects are well-established for a small set of (mostly related) languages, and have had a tremendous influence on linguistic and psycholinguistic theory. Yet, the languages previously studied psycholinguistically are unsuited for distinguishing competing accounts of accessibility effects. For example, according to availability accounts, speakers prefer to mention the more accessible referent earlier in the sentence. According to certain alignment accounts, on the other hand, speakers prefer to make the most accessible referent the subject of the sentence. Both accounts correctly predict English passive vs. active choice. To address these questions, this study will look at morphosyntactic variations in a language that is typologically very different from English: Yucatec (Mayan). The studies will exploit properties of Yucatec to distinguish between accessibility accounts where previously studied languages fail to do so. The studies will also contribute to the establishment of an interdisciplinary research program of field-based psycholinguistics. Since most of the world's languages are spoken far away from psycholinguistic laboratories, it is crucial to adapt and apply psycholinguistic methods to the study of variation under field conditions, where participant recruiting is a non-trivial issue and familiarity with the very concept of an ""experiment"" cannot be assumed. The research will employ two types of production methodologies, recall studies and video description tasks, as well as grammaticality ratings. Production studies are the primary methodology of psycholinguists working on choice in language production, providing quantitative data on what speakers produce. Grammaticality ratings are the primary methodology of theoretical linguists employed in fieldwork. This method will be extended to a quantitative level, making it possible to study gradient preferences in alternations. By using both methods, the relevance and accessibility of the results will be increased for both research communities. In addition to their relevance for psycholinguistic research, the studies will close significant gaps in the scientific record of the grammar of Yucatec, for which close to no quantitative record of syntactic variation exists. This data will help to distinguish between competing analyses of Yucatec syntax, and will contribute to syntactic typology.<br/><br/>The successful completion of the research will have a potentially transformative effect on several disciplines: for psycholinguistics, it will allow theories of production to be tested against a wider set of language data. For field linguistics, it will contribute to the methodological repertoire available for future field work, pushing forward the state-of-the-art in language description. The post-doctoral researcher, graduate research assistants, and undergraduate students will have the experience of participating in and becoming specialists in a newly emerging research paradigm of field-based psycholinguistics. They will be trained in psycholinguistic theory, as well as psycholinguistic and field work methodologies (including state-of-the-art statistical data analysis). The native speaker consultants, who are members of indigenous communities, will receive valuable linguistic training. The sound files from the research will constitute the first large scale documentation of syntactic variation in Mayan. All data will be archived and made freely available, allowing further study of the material. To facilitate similar investigation on other understudied languages, all experimental stimuli and scripts will also be made available."

The ice core records are annually resolved and exceptionally well dated, and will provide, through the analyses of stable isotopes, major soluble ions and for some trace elements, instrumentally calibrated proxies for past temperature, precipitation, atmospheric circulation, chemistry of the atmosphere, sea ice extent, and volcanic activity. These records will be used to understand the role of solar, volcanic, and human forcing on Antarctic climate and to investigate the character of recent abrupt climate change over Antarctica in the context of broader Southern Hemisphere and global climate variability. The intellectual merit of the project is that ITASE has resulted in an array of ice core records, increasing the spatial resolution of observations of recent Antarctic climate variability by more than an order of magnitude and provides the basis for assessment of past and current change and establishes a framework for monitoring of future climate change in the Southern Hemisphere. This comes at a critical time as global record warming and other impacts are noted in the Southern Ocean, the Antarctic Peninsula, and on the Antarctic ice sheet. The broader impacts of the project are that Post-doctoral and graduate students involved in the project will benefit from exposure to observational and modeling approaches to climate change research and working meetings to be held at the two collaborating institutions plus other prominent climate change institutions.

Since the understanding and manipulation of the macroscopic properties of materials relies on information obtained at the microscopic level, one of the challenges in ASE is in developing the framework for a seamless, multiscale study of materials properties and related phenomena. The kinetic Monte Carlo method is one such technique which is suitable for simulations over a large range of length and time scales and which has the potential to connect atomistic details with macroscopic observations.<br/>The standard method is, however, handicapped because of the requirement of prior knowledge of the<br/>underlying atomic mechanisms and their energetics. Typically only a few processes involving single<br/>atom motion are provided as input to kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, thereby neglecting the role of<br/>collective atomic motion, vacancy creation, and complex atomic processes, as well as biasing the time<br/>evolution of the system. In the proposed research in ASE with technical focus in sim and dmc, we plan<br/>to overcome these limitations through the inclusion of unique and innovative pattern recognition schemes<br/>along with automated procedures for the calculation of system energetics on the fly. This procedure will<br/>allow the development of an extensive database of possible atomic events. The database so collected will<br/>serve as input for further analysis and processing using machine learning and data mining for the<br/>development of efficient, robust, and accurate mapping functions which will be extensively tested through<br/>simulations of a variety of phenomena in epitaxial growth and validated through comparison with relevant<br/>experimental data. The resulting mapping functions will serve to vastly increase the accuracy and speed<br/>of simulations.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>Our goal of creating accurate and efficient computational algorithms for the simulation<br/>of phenomena such as thin-film growth will be a significant achievement in the technical focus areas of<br/>sim and dmc, because of the innovative methodologies resulting from cross-disciplinary approaches. The<br/>successful implementation of the algorithms for computer design of materials, however, will be a<br/>breakthrough in ASE, as it will enable the development of technologically important materials with much<br/>reduced cost and much greater control.<br/>The work will also provide us opportunities for educational and outreach activities with broad national, international and societal impact. Apart from the education and training of our graduate and undergraduate students in ITR, we will propose to work with the K-12 community in this endeavor. We intend to do so through the integration of research and education. Our team will collectively incorporate products of the research into courses on computational methods in physics, on data mining, on machine learning, and on adaptive parallelization techniques. A module for instructional and outreach purposes will also be developed. Two high school teachers will be recruited to spend summer sessions at KSU. Regular outreach activities with K-12 teachers and students will help broaden the pool of individuals in IT and nanoscale science literate individuals. Existing international collaborations of the PI with Prof. Alatalo, Finland, Dr. Trushin, Russia, and Dr. Durukanoglu, Turkey will help extend the outcomes of the proposed work internationally."

Prochlorococcus carries out the first step of carbon dioxide fixation in a specialized organelle called the carboxysome. Carboxysomes are self-assembling metabolic modules, composed entirely of protein. Although the polyhedral shape of carboxysomes has been well documented by electron microscopy, their protein composition is known for only a few non-photosynthetic model organisms. Structural studies that address the relationship between carboxysome architecture, which appears to differ among high and low-light adapted Prochlorococcus strains, and its role in enhancing the catalytic efficiency of the carbon dioxide-fixing enzyme (RubisCO) that it encapsulates, have only recently been initiated. We will focus on two Prochlorococcus model strains, MIT9313 and MED4, which represent important ecotypes that have distinct physiological characteristics and ecological distributions. Our preliminary data suggest that MIT9313 and MED4 have evolved key structural and compositional differences in their carboxysomes, and these differences are expected to impact carboxysome function and thus, the carbon fixation capabilities of these strains. In order to achieve an integrative understanding of the role played by carboxysomes in carbon metabolism in these Prochlorococcus strains, we are combining biochemical, biophysical and genetic approaches to analyze interactions between carboxysome components and to examine the relationship between structure and function of individual proteins and of the entire carboxysome. This includes purification of carboxysomes from both Prochlorococcus strains, characterization of their specific protein composition, and the use of recombinant proteins to determine the structures and test the functions of individual carboxysome gene products. Moreover, these data will be placed in physiological and ecological contexts via a combination of in vivo gene and protein expression studies under different environmental conditions and metagenomic surveying of content and expression of genes involved in carbon fixation in the open ocean. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>Our research will advance our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which Prochlorococcus concentrates and fixes carbon dioxide in the oceans. Furthermore, this study will contribute to our knowledge of the contribution of carboxysomes to optimized carbon fixation by autotrophic bacteria in the water column.

We expect our study to reveal novel insights into the role of carboxysome architecture in optimizing carbon dioxide fixation in the open ocean. This could lead to optimization of or design of other specialized bacterial organelles to enhance carbon dioxide fixation.

In the present study, interactions among brain regions of the rodent are tested following local administration of viruses engineered to alter expression of genes required for long-term memory without influencing normal information processing or short-term memory. Thus the current experiments constitute the first empirical tests of interactions among brain regions specialized for memory in the intact brain. The results of these experiments will elucidate neuronal mechanisms and conditions that determine the extent to which distinct brain regions interact during memory formation and consolidation. As such, these experiments have the potential to transform our understanding of how and where memory is stored in the mammalian brain. A primary educational goal of this study is to recruit undergraduate students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the neurosciences to participate in research training internships during the summer months at Tulane University. Students who decide to continue to train in neuroscience research can conduct further studies for course credit in laboratories supervised by the PI and colleagues."

The pore water in an unsaturated soil system forms a complex fabric consisting of saturated pockets of water under negative pressure and a network of liquid bridges formed near the particle contact points. Water influences bulk soil behavior by modifying intergranular stress through negative pressure in the saturated pores, and by providing an intergranular bonding force through the liquid bridges. The magnitude and relevance of each mechanism, however, is highly dependent on the pore water fabric, which is readily altered with changes in suction, saturation, wetting direction, external stress, and global or localized deformation. It is evident that changes to unsaturated soil microstructure under mechanical or hydraulic loading will influence macroscopic soil behavior, but the difficulties associated with its characterization have limited development of microstructure-based frameworks for predicting macro soil response.<br/>This collaborative project seeks to observe and quantify the multiphase fabric of unsaturated soils by making use of recent advances in non-destructive imaging techniques. Microfocus X-ray computed tomography will be integrated with a series of special loading stages designed to image the microstructure of unsaturated sand specimens under controlled suction and stress conditions and over a wide range of saturation and strain. Images will be analyzed to characterize salient features of the multiphase fabric, including 3D grain orientation, particle contact normals, liquid bridge configurations, and the distribution of liquid- and gas-saturated voids. Tensors describing these features will be quantified and their evolution tracked as specimens are subject to controlled changes in suction, wetting direction, compression, and shear. Grain size, density, anisotropy, suction, confining stress, and strain rate will be treated as experimental variables. Microstructural observations will be integrated into a new constitutive framework for unsaturated soil behavior that explicitly accounts for elements of the solid, liquid, and gas fabric.<br/>The research will work to resolve the links between unsaturated soil microstructure and macroscale response, and will implement them through a new constitutive platform for predicting engineering behavior. Observations of fabric evolution with hydraulic and mechanical loading will provide direct evidence to address the bottleneck issues that currently limit our predictive understanding of unsaturated soil behavior, including wetting-drying hysteresis, coupling between suction, saturation and deformation, liquid bridge rupture, dilation, and rate effects. Understanding multiphase interactions in packed particles with wetting fluids is also critical to other scientific fields that deal with physical phenomena such as filtration, drying, pharmaceutical and ceramic agglomeration, and oil recovery. Teaching and diversity will be enhanced through graduate and undergraduate student involvement and educational module development, including activities targeted specifically for women and minorities at the University of Missouri and Washington State University."

Persistence of detrimental traits such as infertility may be caused by ""selfish"" behavior of chromosomes during meiosis, that is, chromosomes that carry harmful traits also carry genes for their own preferential inheritance. This research investigates the cellular and genetic mechanisms, evolutionary history, and fitness consequences of a selfish chromosome in the model wildflower Mimulus guttatus. The projects include cytogenetic determination of whether selfish chromosomal transmission (termed meiotic drive) is caused by divergence in chromosomal structure and/or function, crossing experiments to investigate the genetic basis of differences in the strength of meiotic drive, field measurements of the lifetime effects of carrying selfish chromosomes on reproduction, and surveys of the distribution of selfish chromosomes among populations. <br/><br/>Because research on Mimulus will allow tests of theories about the persistence of selfish chromosomes natural populations, these studies will provide rare insight into a poorly understood, but potentially ubiquitous (and highly influential), biological process. In addition, the project will develop, for broad dissemination, a set of laboratory modules using Mimulus as a model to teach fundamental concepts in genetics and evolution. Postdoctoral scholars, graduates, and undergraduate students will be engaged in generating these educational materials, as well as trained for careers in biology through participation in the research."

In an area around half the size of Chicago, one finds at least seven indigenous languages, five of which are not spoken elsewhere. The region's languages are not well studied, and their names--Abar [mij], Fang [fak], Koshin [kid], Kung [kfl], Mbu' [muc], Mundabli [boe], and Naki [mff]--are virtually unknown, even to other linguists working in Cameroon. These languages are clearly related to the Bantu languages that dominate Subsaharan Africa, but the details of their genetic affiliations otherwise remain largely obscure.<br/><br/>Based on the results of fieldwork conducted since 2004, it has become clear that an important feature of the Lower Fungom region is the nature of the communicative network holding among its thirteen villages that has allowed such extensive linguistic diversity to flourish. Thus, in addition to the traditional issues encountered when doing grammatical description and comparative work on any group of understudied languages, a second set of questions is raised when conducting fieldwork in Lower Fungom regarding the sociolinguistic and historical forces that have created such extreme diversity within such a small area. This project will, therefore, continue the research already begun on the grammar and lexicon of the languages of Lower Fungom and extend it by adding a sociolinguistic and anthropological component to the work.The project will result in the creation of a sociolinguistic survey of the region as well as detailed documentation and description of three of its speech varieties that are only minimally described."

Snyder of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will develop new approaches for the asymmetric halogenation of alkenes by exploring novel classes of electrophilic halogen reagents and surrogates. The success of these efforts will provide the first way to achieve asymmetric halogenation of unactivated olefins as well as direct and indirect halonium-induced cation-pi cyclizations. The addition of these reactions to the synthetic chemistry toolbox would finally make possible the synthesis of dozens of unsolved natural product architectures that possess halogen atoms in combination with unique, and largely unexplored, chemical biology profiles. It should also elucidate principles in reagent design and synthetic strategy that may help to solve other significant challenges. <br/><br/>In addition, the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program will enable Professor Snyder to utilize the power of natural products synthesis and reaction design to expand the number and diversity of students pursuing STEM-based careers. These efforts will be focused on both the high school and undergraduate levels. First, Professor Snyder will offer students and teachers from local high schools in the New York City area, particularly public schools with high socioeconomic diversity, an opportunity to participate in a specially tailored experiential visit day at Columbia University, followed by a chance to work in Professor Snyder's laboratory for eight weeks. In the laboratory, they will work on a challenging chemical research problem and develop an experiment that can be utilized in the school's laboratory program for years to come. Second, Professor Snyder will create an inquiry-based laboratory program for Columbia's introductory undergraduate organic chemistry program based on a natural product total synthesis. This concept is meant to modernize the teaching curriculum, better marry its objectives across lecture and laboratory settings, and best illustrate to undergraduates the real nature and excitement of synthetic organic chemistry."

The objective is to use the techniques of integrable systems, combinatorics, operator theory, and asymptotic analysis to understand, and to derive new results for, these probabilkistic models. One of the basic problems of ASEP is the study of height (or current) fluctuations, in particular to classify various limiting distributions that arise. It is conjectured (KPZ universality) that the fluctuations are universal for a large class of growth models. The PI and Craig A. Tracy established KPZ universality for ASEP with step initial condition, a result that required some new combinatorial identities. The project proposes the study of other initial conditions, in particular Bernoulli initial condition, which would require a better understanding of the combinatorial identities. For the Heisenberg-Ising model the focus will be on the dynamics of domain wall growth. The method will entail a novel use of the Bethe Ansatz that avoids the awkward spectral theory of the Heisenberg-Ising Hamiltonian.<br/><br/>The project would have broad impact in other areas of mathematics and science.The ideas and techniques coming from random matrix theory and integrable systems have had an impact on such diverse subjects as probability, statistics, biostatistics, number theory , condensed matter physics, and engineering. In particular, the ASEP model has applications in nonequilibrium statistical physics and biological systems. In fact, the T(otally)ASEP was introduced in the late 1960s as a model of ribosome motion along mRNA. The understanding of the limit laws that arise, in particular the underlying reason for their ubiquitous occurrence, will have great value in these areas. These universal distributions were first discovered and computed in the mathematical literature and have since found many applications. It is fully expected that elucidation of these laws in ASEP will further impact the applied areas -- not only to create new techniques to solve long-standing problems in the above-mentioned fields but also to proviude new and unexpected applications."

The proposal seeks funding to continue investigations of the dynamical coupling between the stratosphere and the upper regions of the atmosphere, such as the mesosphere and thermosphere. The long-term wintertime mesospheric kinetic temperature observations at South Pole and McMurdo have shown clearly the presence of this dynamical coupling in the Southern Hemisphere through a strong correlation with the maximum stratospheric springtime temperatures at the altitudes of polar stratospheric clouds and. The latter temperatures identify the area where air is sufficiently cold for ice crystals to form. The ice crystals are catalysts in the ozone destruction process and therefore may control the ozone hole area. These results indicate that the dynamical processes leading to the stratospheric warming or cooling are already in place during the austral winter and the early mesospheric signals lead to the potential capability to estimate the springtime ozone hole area. Further observations on these phenomena are needed to better understand the underlying physical processes. The long-term mesospheric measurements in Antarctica provide a window of knowledge into the dynamics of the atmosphere and their effects on global climate changes. Continued reliance on students provides a broader impact of this proposed research and firmly grounds this effort in its educational mission."

The researchers intend to eventually document all of them and disseminate the data in a coordinated fashion: reference grammars, texts, and especially a rich comparative lexicon disseminated in an interactive website with photographic and video-clip illustrations. During this period, the researchers intend to complete work on Bangi Me and six Dogon languages in addition to the six covered in the expiring grant period. The main typological interest of Dogon languages is a system of word- ('A') and phrase-level ('B') tone-contour overlays. All stems (nouns, verbs, etc.) have at least one high-tone element with or without low tones. In various positions, these lexical tone contours are overridden by superimposed contours. For example, the noun is tone-dropped in the sequence [noun adjective], but not in the sequence [noun numeral]. In combinations like [possessor noun adjective], as in 'Seydou's big house', there is a conflict between the adjective, which tries to impose contour 'A' on the preceding noun, and the possessor, which seeks to impose a different tone contour,'B' on the following noun-adjective sequence. In this case, the possessor wins, and the [noun adjective] portion ends up with phrase-wide 'B' tone contour.<br/><br/>The researchers have begun writing a number of separate publications on lexical matters, beginning with action verbs (which profile manner/process rather than, as in English, result/function) and adjectives (which show many ""deep"" syncretisms, as opposed to figurative extensions). The project also supports bringing a phonetician into the field to undertake several focused studies of phonetic issues that have arisen, including the phonetics of liquids {r ,l}, tones, and vowel features."

The measurements will also reveal the conditions and depths where magmas are too dense to rise to the surface, remaining either trapped by neutral buoyancy, or sinking further into our planet's deep interior. The experimental data will also provide new insight into the way in which the Earth was differentiated into crust, mantle, and core during its primordial formation stage. The collaborative effort combines experimental techniques that span the entire range of pressure and temperature conditions that exist for melting and magma production in the Earth. The highest pressures, simulating the deepest regions of Earth's mantle, will be done under dynamic compression at the Caltech Shockwave Laboratory, the intermediate pressures will be carried out under static compression in large presses at the University of New Mexico's High Pressure Laboratory, and the near-surface magmatic conditions will be studied in high temperature furnaces with ultrasonic techniques at the University of Michigan's Experimental Petrology Laboratory.<br/><br/> The new data will lead to the development of an empirically-based equation of state and a model for multicomponent silicate melts. This model should allow precise characterization of the locations of crystal/melt density crossovers in the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle, and D"" layer. This equation of state will be used in models of differentiation of a whole-mantle magma ocean or in defining the chemistry and dynamics of possible silicate melting at the modern core-mantle boundary. The investigators expect that the data will also provide the essential basis for development of next-generation melt models that encompass explicit speciation and/or non-ideal mixing terms. The data gathered under this proposal will be a precious resource for all future studies of melt properties and igneous differentiation at high pressure.

Sharks are important in fisheries worldwide and have been severely depleted in recent decades, often taken as unwanted by-catch in other fisheries. Yet, they are essential top predators needed to maintaining a healthy ecosystem. This research project will show how sharks use all their senses in hunting behavior, starting with initial prey detection, through tracking and locating, and ending with striking their prey. For more complete understanding, we compare a few shark species that appear to use their senses differently mostly because they specialize in different prey in different habitats. A team of experts in sensory and shark biology, using unique testing facilities in Massachusetts and Florida, has been assembled including graduate students being trained in the many technical approaches needed for work on live sharks. The research directly involves undergraduate and high school students and provides extensive outreach to other students of all ages and to the public in general. The accumulated knowledge should lead to a model of shark navigation and predation that can be used for the conservation of sharks, protection of humans, and the engineering design of underwater steering algorithms. The inevitable presentation of this research in future television programs and video documentaries will disseminate new knowledge to the public at large, both of sharks and of rigorous science."

This phenomenon of volunteered geographic information (VGI) is part of a more general trend of user-generated content facilitated by a suite of technologies loosely known as Web 2.0. VGI presents significant new challenges for GIScience research, where existing theory and practices are geared almost exclusively toward more conventional forms of spatial data. Yet to date there exist no rigorous studies investigating the scientific and societal questions raised by this phenomenon. Little is known about why people contribute information, the accuracy or quality of what they produce, appropriate methods for synthesizing or analyzing these data, how the so-called ""digital divide"" may operate to inhibit some people from contributing VGI, or how this phenomenon may impact privacy and confidentiality. <br/><br/>Professors Goodchild (UC Santa Barbara), Elwood (University of Washington) and Sui (Texas A&M) will conduct a 3-year study that will expand basic knowledge about VGI via three overarching objectives. First, the PIs will conduct a comprehensive inventory of existing VGI efforts, and will assess the quality and accuracy of VGI using a sample of these websites. Second, the PIs will evaluate the methodological requirements of VGI with this same subset of VGI sources, evaluating the appropriateness of existing techniques such as spatial data mining and other approaches for analyzing large volumes of spatial data. Third, the PIs will study the social dimensions and impacts of VGI using a qualitative and case-based approach, collecting survey and interview data from applications in emergency management and community development, two important arenas in which VGI is predicted to be beneficial. Finally, to complement these basic and applied research activities, the PIs will establish and facilitate a network of scholars conducting research on VGI, to support compilation and exchange of their research activities, findings, methods, and curricular innovations. <br/><br/>This study makes several important contributions to science and society. It will identify factors that motivate and constrain people from contributing VGI, develop and evaluate techniques for synthesizing and assessing the quality and accuracy of VGI, and investigate the implications of VGI for privacy, confidentiality, and unequal access to digital information and technologies. VGI is thought to have tremendous societal benefits, for example by providing timely information from citizens about the impacts of a natural disaster or early warning of disease outbreaks. This research initiative will make a pivotal contribution toward realizing this potential, by developing basic and applied knowledge about how this new form of geographic information may be acquired, synthesized, and redistributed, and about how its quality may be assessed and assured. Geographic information is a substantial part of the infrastructure of sciences ranging from geophysics to anthropology, so VGI will impact science in novel and important ways. More broadly, VGI entails public participation in the production of geographic information and knowledge at an unprecedented level in human history - potentially six billion or more people could serve as information producers. VGI represents a radical departure from the top-down paradigm that has dominated the production of geographic information for the past few centuries. This project generates theoretical, methodological, and applied knowledge necessary for scientists, educators, policy makers, and citizens to engage this profound transition in productive ways."

Does the meaning of climate change differ between the Arctic and lower latitudes? Between urban and rural areas? What is climate change to you?: Students Doing Science in a Global Network (WCCY) will involve K-12 students in exploring these questions. The project will form a network of 40 schools across the U.S. Canada, Russia, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Greenland where students and teachers will partner with scientists to do science and explore climate change across tundra, taiga, prairies and maritime regions. The overarching objectives of WCCY are to 1) inspire students to examine how climate change affects their own lives and the lives of those around them; 2) to involve students in doing the science of snow and climate; and 3) to connect students with each other and the wider world through science and study of climate change. The hypothesis is that by developing the capacity for students to conduct research and articulate observations within collaborative spaces online, students can take ownership of ?the issue.? This project will investigate how computer-supported collaborative learning environments facilitate student inquiry and scientific learning, sharing, interaction, and collaboration. Field expeditions are powered by Polar Husky sled dogs, transecting the WCCY locations, to kick off the sampling efforts and generate excitement. Participating schools will collaborate through an online forum. Local observations and strategies to adapt documented in online Community Climate Diaries will add to methodologies of engaging local communities in education and research about their knowledge, perceptions and concerns. A kit for each WCCY school, containing a computer base station, the WCCY Fieldwork & Science Guide and field tools, will enable inquiry-driven investigation. Students will 1) document local environmental observations within online Community Climate Diaries, and 2) collect snow depth and SWE measurements, snow crystal observations and temperature data sets. The students will be trained during the field expeditions and thereafter supported by regional science advisors. Two web casts each year will provide continuity and collaboration among the WCCY community. Minority students and teachers in the circumpolar Arctic will include Gwich?in, Yupik and Inupiat in Alaska; Chukchi and Yupik Inuit in Russia; Sami in Finland, Norway and Sweden; Inuit in Greenland; and Inuvialuit, Denee, and Oji-Cree in Canada. GoNorth!, with its substantial outreach, will push WCCY to an audience upwards of 20 million reaching pre-K to senior citizens and into its exciting network of 3000+ classrooms on six continents and across the 50 US states. Student collected data will be used by WCCY scientists, for example, to improve AMSR-E satellite algorithms and interpretation of satellite data. Partnering with such programs as Reindeer Mapper, IPY Snowflake Network, Thermochron Quest and HOW (NASA) build strong science connections for the students? data beyond the realm of WCCY."

It will research a contentious period for evolutionary biology, from the 1880s through the 1930s?roughly from the death of Charles Darwin to the eve of the ""modern evolutionary synthesis,"" when a consensus of sorts was reached on many of the points of contention. It will be conducted in various European and American archives and libraries. The eventual goal is to produce a scholarly monograph and a series of preliminary articles.<br/><br/>The planned publications will focus on two generations of biologists in Germany and Austria (foremost among them Ernst Haeckel, Richard Semon, Paul Kammerer, and Ludwig Plate), their competition with each other and with scientists in Britain and the U.S. to define ""Darwinism"" and modernize it in response to twentieth-century challenges. <br/><br/>Among the challenges they faced were discerning the nature and causes of variation, reconciling the rule of law in nature with the unpredictability of evolutionary change, responding to the increasing prestige and authority of experimentation over the evolutionist's traditional comparative methods. The period includes the advent of genetics, the chromosome theory, and new ways of conceptualizing heredity and variation. It also includes the eugenics movement and rising expectations for biologists to address social problems, as well as global and national political changes in the wake of the First World War.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the broadening scope of the historical literature on Darwinism by filling out the international and inter-generational picture, revising standard views of the politics of German biology, and especially by making new and stronger connections between nineteenth- and twentieth-century Darwinian thought. It will also be of interest to biologists and philosophers working on ""evo-devo,"" the new evolutionary developmental biology, to see how the relationships among evolution, development, and heredity have been defined and debated before. In addition, many issues addressed by this research have been in the public eye in twenty-first-century America, and the project should have an impact on science teaching and public understanding of evolution and its political, religious and moral interpretations."

Coordinated movements of loosely-packed mesenchymal cells in the early embryo construct the vertebrate body plan and populate tissues in preparation for the construction of muscles, connective tissue and bone, as well as the lymphatic and circulatory systems. Many genes and many cells participate in these events, but there is little experimental evidence on how genes and cells generate physical forces and integrate biochemical pathways to drive mechanical movements within embryos. The goal of this research is to investigate how genes control the physical mechanics of multicellular mesenchymal tissues by: 1) analyzing the physics of re-aggregation and the cellular mechanics responsible for rapid phases of tissue sculpting, 2) challenging cells with varied micro-environments and assessing how their behavior changes, and 3)vary levels of cell adhesion molecules and surface contractility to reveal how mesenchymal tissue spreading and engulfment are mechanically coordinated. Understanding the molecular basis of rules governing the ordered assembly of mesenchymal tissue will explain how events at the subcellular scale coordinate cell behaviors during assembly of organs and functional tissues. These findings will complement and extend efforts to understand the molecular basis of mesenchymal morphogenesis and begin the process of integrating the molecular machinery into larger ""morphogenetic"" processes that are robust and may be adapted by tissue engineers. The cross- and interdisciplinary training resulting from this project will provide biologists and tissue engineers the ability to integrate learned concepts into a framework the will be important for both fields."

This rapid glacial recession has important implications for coastal watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry because the loss of glacier ice decreases hydrologic storage and dramatically alters catchment landcover by exposing new land to the process of primary succession. The ecological development of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems following deglaciation has been explored extensively, however there has been very little research on how landcover change will alter material delivery into and through the river network to coastal estuaries. This project will fill this critical knowledge gap by evaluating how glacial recession is altering hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in coastal watersheds in southeastern Alaska. In particular, our research will develop a comprehensive understanding of how the speciation, fate and transport of riverine nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) will be altered by ongoing glacial retreat. Weekly and storm sampling combined with continuous discharge measurements will provide the first detailed and complete comparison of nutrient and DOM yields between paired glacial and non-glacial watersheds. Continuous measurements of discharge, oxygen, temperature and turbidity will be used to quantify the effects of glacial meltwater on hydrologic and physical parameters. Experimental approaches (laboratory and field-scale) combined with longitudinal surveys and stream tracers will be used to elucidate the fate of nutrients and DOM during downstream transport. Finally, longitudinal synoptics and source sampling will also be used to access the primary landscape sources of nutrients and carbon to the stream. Ultimately, project findings will provide new insights into how land-to-ocean fluxes of organic and inorganic nutrients are being altered by glacial recession along the GOA and in other glaciated coastal regions.<br/>The project will provide laboratory and field research opportunities for undergraduates at the University of Alaska Southeast (UAS), a small, undergraduate university with a high (16%) enrollment of native Alaskan students. Additionally, the project will provide training for one graduate student and one post-doctoral researcher. The integration of undergraduate students in this research project will provide a framework for students and researchers to cooperatively investigate important linkages among climate, landcover change, and hydrological and biogeochemical processes in coastal watersheds. In addition, the project will strengthen an existing partnership between scientists at UAS and naturalists at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center who will work collaboratively to incorporate project results into an interpretive display at the center. The Mendenhall Glacier is the most visited glacier in the United States and hosts over 300,000 visitors each year and thus provides a unique and effective opportunity for public outreach and education related to the findings of this project. Finally, a science educator from Montgomery County, VA will partake in field work during one of the summers. The science educator will bring their experience into the local classrooms and share their experience with their peers."

The east African rift valley lakes may be the only high-productivity, low-nutrient freshwater ecosystems. The profusion of life in these lakes is concentrated at their edges, where sufficient light reaches the lake bottom to allow for high rates of photosynthesis of the algae growing on the rocks.  But how is high algal productivity maintained in the face of 1) the extreme scarcity of critical nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in the environment and 2) the intense grazing pressure imposed by high densities and rich diversity of herbivorous fish?  The answer may lie in the grazing fish themselves. The hypothesis that the negative impacts of fish on their algal food resource are offset by the positive effects of fish on nutrient availability will be tested. Lab and field experiments will be used to test whether fish promote ecosystem productivity by 1) slowing the loss of nutrients to deeper waters by storing nutrients in their bodies; 2) rapidly recycling dietary nutrients between algae, animals, and the environment; and 3) promoting the growth of types of algae that are able to use and retain forms of nutrients unavailable to most algal species. Thus, algae-eating fish may encourage the growth of their own food resources by speeding up the nutrient cycle, stockpiling nutrients, and increasing the influx of new nutrients into the ecosystem.  Testing the importance of fish in sustaining lake productivity requires measuring nutrient storage and recycling by fish, experimentally testing whether algae grow faster when fish are present, measuring inputs of nutrients from the depths of the lake, and using theoretical models to compare the importance of fish and other nutrient inputs.  This combination of activities will be pursued both under field conditions in Africa and in laboratories in the United States.<br/><br/>This project will help to guide efforts to protect the hundreds of unique species and the globally-important fishery of Lake Tanganyika by clarifying two critical issues.  First, fishermen are catching too many fish in many lakes worldwide, including Lake Tanganyika.  This overharvest may remove too many nutrients from the lake, or reduce the rate of nutrient recycling so that algae grow more slowly.  By that mechanism, fishing could actually undercut the future productivity of the lake.  Second, climate change is warming the surface waters of the lake and reducing the seasonal winds that cause cold, nutrient rich waters to periodically well up from the depths of the lake. Reduction in the frequency of influx of these deep-water nutrients is cutting off the algal growth that sustains the fish.  This research will offer the first thorough evaluation of how these human-imposed factors will affect the productivity of Lake Tanganyika, which supports a regional human economy. The project will increase public awareness of Lake Tanganyika?s aquatic life through a website, an article for an aquarium hobbyist magazine, and a popular science article.  Finally, many students from Wright State University and the University of Michigan will gain professional experience through involvement in the project.  This will include students from Africa as well as Americans. Partnerships with African and global non-profit organizations will further broaden the impact of the research."

A highlight of the project is a summer school for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students. The school will consist of two three-week courses that introduce students to current research techniques in IPDE. Topics will include both theoretical models and numerical tools. These courses will be supplemented by week-long guest lecturers, who will give talks that complement the main topics. The summer school will be coordinated with the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at UW that is run by co-PI James Morrow. The budget includes funding for three UW students to attend the REU program, and for a teaching assistant to offset the increased workload. The IPDE group will additionally institute a Visiting Academic and Industrial Internship Program for its graduate students. Advanced graduate students will be offered the opportunity to work with senior researchers at institutions in the US and abroad. Past IPDE students have profited from such visits to other universities, as well as to research laboratories at Chevron and Lawrence Livermore. RTG funding will allow the IPDE group to systematize this practice and make it available to all IPDE students. A significant portion of the grant is to provide for the support of graduate students and postdoctoral assistants. Funding is included for a total of eight years of postdoctoral fellows at 50% support and for an average of seven graduate students in graduate traineeships each year of the grant. Graduate students will be supported for two quarters of the academic year, as well as for the summer quarter. Postdoctoral fellows will receive their remaining salary through teaching a 50% normal load. Travel funds are included for both graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Undergraduate stipends are also provided to fund undergraduate research projects and internships in local laboratories. The IPDE seminar series will be enhanced through a preseminar series of lectures, and funding is provided for extended visits to the department by seminar speakers.<br/><br/><br/>IPDE is an active field that encompasses research in seismic exploration, medical imaging, and models arising in physical theories. The RTG grant provides significant support for graduate education in this area during a period of reduced local funding for teaching assistant positions. The average of fourteen quarters per year of graduate traineeship support in the budget will allow the department to sustain a vital graduate student population, and provide US citizen and permanent resident IPDE students with release time from teaching duties to devote to research. These graduate students will receive funding under the budgeted Academic and Industrial Internship Program for extended visits to other universities and research laboratories. They will establish contacts with potential employers and build relations with additional academic mentors. These contacts will be created at stages in their careers before they have the responsibilities of academic positions and will assist them throughout their early careers. The funding for postdoctoral associate positions will allow IPDE members to leverage department and college funds to form a viable group of postdoctoral researchers. The 50% teaching load will provide additional time for postdoctoral associates to devote to research; travel funds will allow for visits to other institutions. The summer school will attract advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students from across the country and introduce them to current research topics in the field of IPDE. The department will be able to identify potential students to recruit to its graduate program, and the graduate support funds will allow us to attract top candidates. Support for the REU program will sponsor the participation of three students each year from UW. This program attracts applications nationwide, and there are many more qualified applicants than can be currently funded. A number of strong applicants come through the honors undergraduate courses at UW and will be recruited for the REU program. Funding for an additional TA position to assist with running the REU will benefit all participants and provide an advanced undergraduate or graduate student with support during the summer. The collective activities of the RTG grant will strengthen the IPDE program at UW at all career levels, and introduce students nationwide to this important area of research."

The work involves advanced computational and experimental methods that will result in the development of a new electromagnetic casting process and of a process model that is general enough to apply to several conventional electromagnetic casting and solidification processes. The research approach will progress from the development of a comprehensive mathematical model of the melting operation to understanding of the influences of casting variables on the microstructures and mechanical properties of cast magnesium alloys. Deliverables include a modeling and analysis tools, development of a processing-microstructure-properties database, documentation and dissemination of research results, engineering student education, and engineering research experiences for undergraduates.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will provide a series of computational tools that can be used to optimize electromagnetic melting and casting of metals. This research will also yield a means to produce castings with high purities, low defect contents, and unique microstructures. Examples include light weight magnesium alloys which are highly reactive and difficult to produce. The computational tools developed in this research will be broadly applicable to other electromagnetic melting and casting techniques such as skull induction melting and electromagnetic casting. The results will be disseminated to allow the creation of commercial devices that have increased precision, reduced cost, reduced weight, and improved recyclability. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research. Undergraduate students from the University of Alabama and historically black colleges and universities will be engaged to provide them firsthand research experience."

From the LGN, information is relayed to the cortex, where neurons have properties closely related to our perceptual experience. To understand how the cortex acquires its remarkable abilities, data on its inputs from the LGN are needed. When we view objects in the world, the neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are stimulated by small regions of space called their receptive fields. This project will record the electrical responses of the LGN neurons of monkeys performing a visual task. Linear mathematical models of the receptive fields of LGN neurons will be constructed based on their responses to simple forms. These models will be used to predict responses of the LGN cells to natural scenes. In addition, the effects of regions of space surrounding the receptive fields will be assessed. These surrounding regions are expected to reduce the activity of the LGN neurons so that they are more efficient and they conserve energy. In addition to improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying human perception, the results may help to generate ideas about improved designs of artificial vision systems that have wide applications in industry. This collaborative project will provide training for a graduate student in neuroscience at the University of Texas and will also provide training and data for graduate students doing mathematical modeling at Boston University."

This technician will support a new ICP-MS purchased through GEO/EAR and GEO/OCE funds. The technician will serve several key duties. He/She will obviously have a major roll in keeping the instrument running and well maintained. In addition, the technician will be responsible for student training and integration. Another major responsibility (and a driver for hiring a PhD-level applicant) is in method development. The instrument will be incorporated into a multi-user facility and will be an open-access and work under a cost recharge model. This request is responsive to the solicitation in that the new hire will be partially-funded through the University and after the term of the proposed grant, will be fully funded through UH, recharge and grant support. The PIs have a strong research footprint in NSF-EAR and OCE projects. The new MC-ICP-MS was associated with a EAR-IF grant. General research efforts revolve around U-series, Pb, Nd, and Sr isotope measurement s for volcanology, mantle geochemistry, environmental science and marine research. Applications include U-series measurements to link volcanic conditions to eruption style, development of 231Pa isotope dilution analysis to elucidate biogenic sediment geochronology, U-series measurements to reconstruct Hawaiian and other regional sea level histories and determine munitions contaminant biogeochemistry, and Ra isotope measurements in hydrothermal fluids in order to proxy rock ages and water-rock exchange processes. The new MC-ICP-MS will allow Sr, Nd, Pb and Hf isotope analyses as Earth history proxies - however, much development work is needed to convert existing TIMS methodologies to more sensitive laser ablation and wet-chemical ICP-MS analyses. These isotopes will serve as provenance tracers and be used to elucidate deposits, weathering and paleoclimatology. Adding Os isotopes will help elucidate pelagic carbonate and chert sequences. Additional efforts will involve tracking volcanic and anthropogenic isotopes during basaltic lava volatilization and condensation - Se, Cd, Tl, Te, Zn and Cu isotope fractionation will serve as the analytical proxy. Finally, Mg isotope analysis will be used to better understand oceanic Mg cycling through hydrothermal systems. The new analytical capabilities will allow additional synergies amongst faculty, students and outside users. The new technician will assist in training new users ? thus helping to produce tomorrow?s geoscientists. The facility will support a diverse researcher and student population.<br/><br/>***"

A combination of satellite remote sensing and numerical modeling will be used to investigate both past and ongoing patterns of change. New high-resolution surface elevation maps made from a novel combination of satellite laser altimetry and remotely observed surface shape provide a unique view of grounding zones. These data will be used to diagnose events associated with the shutdown of Kamb Ice Stream, to investigate a recent discharge event on Institute Ice Stream and to investigate ongoing change at the outlet of Whillans Ice Stream, along with other modern processes around the West Antarctic. An existing numerical model of coupled ice sheet, ice stream, and ice shelf flow will be used and improved as part of the research project. The broader impacts of the project relate to the importance of understanding the role of polar ice sheets in global sea level rise. The work will contribute to the next round of deliberations for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Improved views, interpretations, and insights into the physical processes that govern variability in ice sheet outlet streams will help correct the shortcomings of the last IPCC report that didn?t include the role of ice sheets in sea level rise.

The latter scenario would result in greatly reduced diversity, dominance of a few opportunistic taxa, and unstable ecosystems. There is mounting evidence from the late Paleozoic ice age (about 300 million years ago) that terrestrial, and possibly also marine communities, underwent rapid fluctuations during times of climate change. A complete transition from glaciated icehouse to non-glaciated greenhouse world is recorded in late Paleozoic sedimentary rocks exposed in northern Bolivia, providing an ideal deep-time archive in which to test for climate-induced disruption to marine ecosystems. In particular, the localities in Bolivia were located in subtropical latitudes 300 million years ago, a pivotal region where many species would have been especially sensitive to changing conditions. Quantitative paleoecological analysis will compare the relative abundance of each fossil type in more than 120 sedimentary layers spanning the interval of deglaciation and postglacial climate warming. Statistical tests using that dataset will enable recognition of both long-term trends in community composition and, if present, short-term fluctuations indicative of community disruption. The results from this research will help constrain the general principles of climate-biosphere interactions."

A key concern in many alpine watersheds is metal contamination, either from abandoned mining operations or from natural sources. In order to design and prioritize useful water management and remediation strategies, we need to identify important metal sources and understand how metal loads change over different spatial and temporal scales. We will attack this problem in a new way - by using the emerging tools of Fe and Zn isotopes to fingerprint metal sources and to identify metal transport processes in mountain catchments impacted by acidic, metal-rich waters. <br/>We have framed this investigation to advance scientific understanding in three main areas: 1) Distinguishing between Fe and Zn loads that are attributable to groundwater discharge to surface-water as opposed to surface runoff, 2) Distinguishing between anthropogenic and natural sources of Fe and Zn, and 3) Correlating seasonal changes in Fe and Zn isotopes with hydrogeochemical changes. We will complete our project by integrating our findings into a conceptual model for evaluating metal contamination in alpine waters. Our research plan includes targeted field sampling of waters (both dissolved and suspended loads) and rocks in Prospect and Handcart Gulches in Colorado, and complementary lab experiments with sulfide-rich mineral separates. Both field sites are contaminated with metals and include remarkable access to groundwater through existing networks of monitoring wells. We will also take advantage of differences in metal sources (anthropogenic vs. natural) and in dissimilar groundwater-surface water relationships in these watersheds to test our hypotheses. <br/>Our proposal is collaborative, combining the expertise and resources within the U. S. Geological Survey with PI Borrok and students in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). Our work will specifically broaden participation from underrepresented students already at UTEP. UTEP is the only research-intensive doctoral university in the U.S. with a Mexican-American majority student population. To further enhance educational opportunities, we have partnered with the Mountain Studies Institute, an independent research/education institution and alpine field station in Silverton, Colorado. We will utilize the MSI?s boarding, field laboratory, and educational facilities for our field work in Prospect Gulch. Partnerships with the USGS and MSI will allow students at UTEP access to cutting-edge equipment/facilities and to participate in a broad range of research experiences."

Pioneering explorations will continue to define new examples of aperiodic quasicrystals and their crystalline approximants, intermetallic systems with particularly low valence electron concentrations that exhibit unusual crystal structures and special electronic stabilities. The active metal (Ca, Ba, etc.) ? Pt, Au, Ag ? triel, tetrel (group 13,14) elements are typical ternary components. New chemical insights into their compositions, structures, bonding and special electronic stabilities will be exploited. New metal-rich compositions that exhibit different kinds of special electronic effects are also sought, e.g., electronic pseudogaps. Synthetic explorations together with physical characterizations will also examine new horizons and unexpected chemistry within metal-rich cationic networks of rare-earth and transition metals paired with main-group metalloid or nonmetal anions, of Te, Sb, or Bi especially. These phases are in essence the inverse of the condensed intermetallic ?salts? containing polyanionic networks and simple cations described in the first part. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT <br/>The majority of elements in the Periodic Table are metals, and thus compounds formed between two or more metallic elements make up a large fraction of possible compounds, all other factors being neglected. Moreover, very little is known about most metal-rich materials, which are generally unique in their properties and structures relative to compounds made of other more conventional elements in the Table. We are seeking to extend and advance solid state and materials chemistry concepts and knowledge into unexplored regions of intermetallic chemistry, particularly those relatively poor in electrons around a few classical examples of special chemistry and physics. Quasicrystals and their approximants are examples of such special and contemporary phases. In a broader view, educational and research programs at the frontiers of solid state and materials chemistry around the world have over the years been broadened and strengthened by our research programs.

Existing engineering models simply fit the open circuit voltage empirically and postulate dynamics by linear diffusion of intercalated lithium, but recent experiments contradict this picture for phase-separating materials. In contrast, the team will develop robust mathematical models to predict the voltage and current response over the full range of operating conditions.

The goal will be to provide the first mathematical description of emerging high-rate materials, where phase transformations occur via nonlinear intercalation waves, coupling anisotropic diffusion and electrochemical reactions. This effort will also raise basic mathematical questions in linear and nonlinear stability, degenerate wave solutions, and numerical methods.<br/><br/>In spite of extensive engineering over the past few decades, the performance of rechargeable batteries has improved only incrementally. Power density (charge/discharge rate per unit mass) and cycle life must still improve drastically for applications such as electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, and this will require a better fundamental understanding of how ions are inserted and extracted from porous electrodes. To meet this need, the project creates a Focused Research Group from mathematics, chemical engineering, and materials science to develop a new theoretical paradigm for Li-ion batteries. The group will guide the engineering of new ultrafast Li-ion batteries, capable of charging and discharging in seconds rather than hours, while opening fruitful directions for applied mathematics. The group will train graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs, organize annual workshops, and develop a course on mathematical modeling of electrochemical energy systems."

While frequently a good description of observed behavior, there are instances where people instead choose alternatives in proportion to their associated probabilities of reward. This probability matching behavior is sub-optimal. Probability matching behavior and optimal behavior would both result depending on the time available to make decisions (where more time produces more optimal decisions) if individuals base their choices on a sampling algorithm. In this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement grant, the PI will test whether such an algorithm is responsible for observed choices and, furthermore, whether people are optimally suboptimal (i.e., optimal in their decision regarding when to be more, or less, optimal.<br/><br/>To test these hypotheses, experimental subjects will be assessed in terms of how flexible they are at making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy in motor decisions under uncertainty and how generic decision processes are across decision domains. Subjects are then tested for whether their decisions under cognitive stress deteriorate to probability-matching, as predicted by the proposed algorithm. Finally, subjects will be tested using fMRI to determine whether one brain structure represents expected utility arising from different sources of uncertainty. This research holds promise for reconciling models of humans as ideal agents with established failures and limitations of human decision-making."

Scholars from every subfield now regularly turn to experiments. The recent penchant for experimentation means that political scientists face a variety of distinct challenges. The design, implementation, and analysis of experiments raise a number of issues that political scientists are not historically accustomed to addressing. This is particularly the case for political science due to the breadth of the discipline, the varying contexts in which experiments are implemented (e.g., laboratory, survey, field), and the distinct methods employed (e.g., psychological or economic approaches to experimentation).<br/><br/>In order to ensure that the discipline maximizes its return on experimental methodology, this project supports a unifying conference, ""Experimentation in Political Science"" and the publication of the first Handbook of Experimental Political Science that will contain the papers from the conference. The conference and volume include contributions from more than twenty-five leading political scientists. The basic goals of the conference and volume are to situate experiments in the broader discipline, to present important methodological issues, and to review the contributions of prominent experimental research. The volume serves as a reference for both teaching and research.<br/><br/>Another important contribution will involve student involvement in the conference. Graduate students from around the country will attend the conference and participate in a mentoring program with the faculty attendees. This provides students with a solid basis for pursuing future experimental research. The project ensures that political science experiments approach the highest level of intellectual rigor, thereby enabling political scientists to make substantial contributions to policy-makers in the usage and interpretation of experiments (e.g., in the evaluations of social programs, policies, institutions, and mass communications)."

To realize its full potential, SERS substrates are required that generate large and reproducible electromagnetic field enhancements. In this project fabrication technologies are developed that provide control over the complex electromagnetic response of two-dimensional plasmonic structures. To achieve this aim chemical assembly procedures and lithographic nanofabrication approaches will be combined to generate nanoscale noble metal structures at defined locations over micron length scales. Reliable fabrication methods for locations of giant electromagnetic field enhancement - so called ""hot spots"" - will allow a rational fabrication of optimized SERS substrates which combine large field enhancement and high reproducibility. The intellectual merit of the effort is that it will improve our understanding of the complex electromagnetic interactions in periodic and aperiodic plasmonic structures with multiple length scales. The broader impact of the project is that the optimized SERS substrates will allow a rapid and reliable identification of bacterial pathogens through SERS. This is highly relevant, for instance, in the clinical setting where it could enable more effective treatment strategies of acute infections. SERS substrates with improved reliability and reproducibility will also lead to entirely new applications of SERS in challenging biological and biomedical sensing applications. In addition to the scientific impact of this proposal, there are clear educational and outreach impacts. The project will offer students and junior researchers the opportunity to participate in a collaborative research and education program. Because both the topic and technique are of great interest to the general population, this effort will enable a substantial outreach program. One important component will be the Boston University Nanocamp, organized by the PI in collaboration with the Boston University's learning network resource (LERNet). The nanocamp will attract and familiarize students from inner-city high schools - which typically have a higher fraction of underrepresented groups - to the research outlined in this proposal."

This proposal seeks to develop a simple and high-throughput strategy for fabricating these precisely patterned and monodisperse nanoscale components. Specifically, the proposed strategy that will be developed involves the self-assembly of two dimensional lithographically patterned templates to form three dimensional, untethered polyhedral components. In addition to demonstrating the applicability of the process at the 100 nanometer length scale, investigations directed at understanding defect tolerance and parameters that influence overall yield will also be carried out. <br/><br/>The proposed low-cost, mass production of nanoscale components, with arbitrary patterning will enable a wide range of miniaturized and more effective devices to be constructed for applications such as nanoelectronics, biomolecular imaging, drug delivery, sensing, and actuation. Additionally, the process is compatible with present day fabrication of microchips; hence the process allows the seamless integration of electronic modules, such as transistors and sensors, within the components. Along with the research, a concerted effort will be made to enhance undergraduate education and outreach in Baltimore high schools. Undergraduate students, high school teachers and students, including under represented minorities, will be invited to participate in research experiences.

Auctions are important market institutions and provide a unique window on strategic behavior in markets with asymmetric information.  Demand estimation is fundamental to a wide range of empirical work in microeconomics.<br/><br/>The work on auctions includes methodological research on estimation of first-price auctions when unobservables affect the sample of auctions observed, the set of bidders participating, and the bids they make. We provide new identification results, a new estimation approach, and simulation studies to evaluate the methods. The project also includes an empirical examination of Federal mineral lease auctions on the U.S. Outer-Continental Shelf.  Over the last 25 years there have been several major changes in technology and policy that are likely to have significant effects on these sales.  We examine the effects of these changes on bidder participation, bidding, drilling, and production. We study the effects of three-dimensional imaging technology on the information structure and bidding at these auctions, and also assess the controversial royalty relief program.<br/>    The work on demand for differentiated products is comprised of three components, each examining what can be learned under weaker assumptions than those typically considered previously. The first considers the case in which consumer-level characteristics and choices are observable (micro data).  The model of preferences is nonparametric and distribution free, nesting random coefficients discrete choice models widely used in practice with parametric functional form and distributional assumptions. It incorporates choice-specific unobservables and a very flexible specification of how preferences vary across products and individuals. This component of the work provides a deeper understanding of the data and assumptions required to obtain reliable estimates. The second project considers the case in which one observes only market level data.  This case is more challenging and requires a different type of argument;  however, we again obtain positive results for less restrictive models than those previously considered.  The third project examines demand estimation allowing for the fact that when firms choose the products to offer, this leads to correlation between observable and unobservable characteristics of products.  We provide conditions for identification, then develop, evaluate, and apply new estimation methods.<br/>    <br/>The methodological components of this work addresses issues of importance to the analysis of economic and policy questions in fields ranging from anti-trust policy to the economics of education and the allocation of public resources.   Some of the empirical work addresses issues of direct importance to government policy in the U.S.  The work will be disseminated broadly through research seminars, conference presentations, and publication of research articles.

This research is motivated by an intriguing pattern observed in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in southern Quebec lakes. Individuals living in lakes where fishing is permitted mature earlier and at smaller sizes than those from lakes without fishing. This research attempts to explain this pattern. It uses a novel combination of mathematical models, field surveys and DNA studies to test for harvest-induced evolution. <br/><br/>This research has practical applications for fisheries management. The decision to harvest fish above a certain size, as well as how many individuals to harvest, depends on whether the fishery can recover to its original state. If changes in age/size at maturity caused by harvesting are not genetic, then simply ceasing (or at least reducing) fishing is likely to allow the population to recover. However, if changes have a genetic basis, then a new approach to establishing fishing policies is needed. The researcher will share his findings with policy stakeholders and will develop new, open-source computational tools that fishery management professionals can use to develop policies that mitigate the evolutionary effects of harvesting natural populations."

Boyd, will undertake research on the important question: Why do humans cooperate in war when this means putting their individual lives at risk for the benefit of their social group? This is called the ""collective action problem"" by social scientists. Four explanations for such cooperation are prominent in the literature: people cooperate to avoid punishment, people fight to enhance their reputations as cooperators, people fight to signal personal qualities to potential mates, and people fight in order to benefit relatives. The researcher will test these competing hypotheses with data to be gathered in 13 months of field work among the Turkana, a nomadic pastoralist people of northwest Kenya. The Turkana practice large-scale cattle raiding, which makes them appropriate for this research. <br/><br/>Data will be collected in the Turkana region by recruiting herders who visit the town of Lokichoggio from nomadic settlements in the north Turkana territory. The researcher will employ a mix of methods including, 1) in-depth semi-structured interviews with warriors for behavioral data relating to the predictions, and for an ethnographic understanding of raiding; 2) vignette studies to explore how people respond to specific scenarios where individuals fail to contribute in a raid; and 3) behavioral economic experiments for insight into how raiding affects preferences for cooperation within one's own group. <br/><br/>The results of this study will elucidate how the collective action problem is dealt with in pre-state warfare, and will thereby contribute towards understanding the basis of large-scale cooperation in humans, more generally. The research also will shed new light on the causes of human warfare."

The first problem concerns optimal decay estimates for oscillatory integral operators in two dimensions. In the second, degenerate versions of the Carleson-Sjolin estimates will be pursued. The third project involves a linearized inverse problem for wave equations arising in seismic imaging which leads to analysis and composition of degenerate Fourier integral operators. Finally, analysis on singular spaces will be used to understand the theoretical limits to cloaking and other transformation optics designs.<br/><br/>Progress on these problems will add to the understanding of partial differential equations, the operators which are used to solve them, and the behavior of their solutions. Many laws of nature are expressed as partial differential equations, which govern physical quantities of interest, such as electromagnetic field strength, pressure exerted by acoustic waves or the quantum-mechanical probability that a particle will be found in a particular place. The techniques to be developed in this project are applicable to equations that govern various kinds of wave propagation and are based on a geometric point of view in understanding and manipulating the singularities which are present. In particular, the third project has the potential to facilitate seismic exploration in situations where images are distorted by the presence of multiple rays connecting seismic source to receiver. The fourth project concerns theoretical underpinnings of the recently emergent field of transformation optics, which has the potential to produce unusual effects on various kinds of waves (e.g., electromagnetic, acoustic, quantum mechanical) using artificially structured materials known as metamaterials."

For example, English speakers may use an active or a passive. They are more likely to choose a passive over an active if the patient, but not the agent, is human and hence more accessible (""The girl was struck by lightning""). Such accessibility effects are well-established for a small set of (mostly related) languages, and have had a tremendous influence on linguistic and psycholinguistic theory. Yet, the languages previously studied psycholinguistically are unsuited for distinguishing competing accounts of accessibility effects. For example, according to availability accounts, speakers prefer to mention the more accessible referent earlier in the sentence. According to certain alignment accounts, on the other hand, speakers prefer to make the most accessible referent the subject of the sentence. Both accounts correctly predict English passive vs. active choice. To address these questions, this study will look at morphosyntactic variations in a language that is typologically very different from English: Yucatec (Mayan). The studies will exploit properties of Yucatec to distinguish between accessibility accounts where previously studied languages fail to do so. The studies will also contribute to the establishment of an interdisciplinary research program of field-based psycholinguistics. Since most of the world's languages are spoken far away from psycholinguistic laboratories, it is crucial to adapt and apply psycholinguistic methods to the study of variation under field conditions, where participant recruiting is a non-trivial issue and familiarity with the very concept of an ""experiment"" cannot be assumed. The research will employ two types of production methodologies, recall studies and video description tasks, as well as grammaticality ratings. Production studies are the primary methodology of psycholinguists working on choice in language production, providing quantitative data on what speakers produce. Grammaticality ratings are the primary methodology of theoretical linguists employed in fieldwork. This method will be extended to a quantitative level, making it possible to study gradient preferences in alternations. By using both methods, the relevance and accessibility of the results will be increased for both research communities. In addition to their relevance for psycholinguistic research, the studies will close significant gaps in the scientific record of the grammar of Yucatec, for which close to no quantitative record of syntactic variation exists. This data will help to distinguish between competing analyses of Yucatec syntax, and will contribute to syntactic typology. <br/><br/>The successful completion of the research will have a potentially transformative effect on several disciplines: for psycholinguistics, it will allow theories of production to be tested against a wider set of language data. For field linguistics, it will contribute to the methodological repertoire available for future field work, pushing forward the state-of-the-art in language description. The post-doctoral researcher, graduate research assistants, and undergraduate students will have the experience of participating in and becoming specialists in a newly emerging research paradigm of field-based psycholinguistics. They will be trained in psycholinguistic theory, as well as psycholinguistic and field work methodologies (including state-of-the-art statistical data analysis). The native speaker consultants, who are members of indigenous communities, will receive valuable linguistic training. The sound files from the research will constitute the first large scale documentation of syntactic variation in Mayan. All data will be archived and made freely available, allowing further study of the material. To facilitate similar investigation on other understudied languages, all experimental stimuli and scripts will also be made available."

This project examines those services provided by the high altitude páramo grasslands of the northern Andes. The concept of Payment for Ecosystem Services is being implemented in Ecuador, leading to tree planting in páramo grasslands to sequester carbon and alteration of traditional burning and grazing regimes to enhance water resources. However, the biophysical outcomes of these and related changes in land use and management are poorly understood, and in some cases well-intended changes may not be producing the desired outcomes. In this project, the researchers will systematically investigate the effects of land use change on the production of soil-related ecosystem services, quantify potential tradeoffs among ecosystem services, and evaluate policy implications of different land management strategies. The primary objectives are 1) to determine how land use change affects carbon storage, water storage, and water transmission in Andean páramo soils and 2) to evaluate which land uses maximize ecosystem services related to both carbon and water in páramo grassland soils. The researchers will integrate field observations and in situ experiments at two páramo study sites, Zuleta (northern Ecuador) and the Nudo del Azuay (southern Ecuador), with laboratory analyses of soil samples, and assessment of synergies, trade-offs, and relevant policies to quantify and predict effects of land use change on carbon- and water-related ecosystem services. <br/><br/>This research will provide essential data for predicting ecosystem responses to land use change and will have immediate societal application by improving the scientific basis for Payment for Ecosystem Services programs. The results will provide key data for conservation organizations on the appropriateness of forestation as a form of land restoration in the study region, and will inform policies and programs intended to enhance both terrestrial carbon sequestration and water provision in the Ecuadorian Andes. The research also will provide educational opportunities for several graduate students and a middle-school science teacher from the U.S. and for participating undergraduate students at the University of Azuay in Ecuador, and it will strengthen the collaboration between the investigators and their Ecuadorian partners."

However, recent reports linking chemical contaminants in wastewater effluent with adverse impacts to fish as well as decreased confidence of the public in the safety of potable water supplies has led to a need to remove trace concentrations of organic compounds from effluent. While advanced treatment systems, such as reverse osmosis membranes, can remove many contaminants, high costs, energy consumption and production of wastes are likely to limit their future application. Despite a lack of knowledge about their design or efficacy, treatment wetlands are being installed worldwide as an alternative means of removing trace concentrations of organic contaminants from wastewater effluent. The principal objective of this project is to develop an understanding of the mechanisms of contaminant removal in treatment wetlands that will allow engineers to predict treatment efficiency and to optimize the removal of specific contaminants.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the project are related primarily to efforts to test hypotheses about mechanisms of contaminant removal. Through the use of a custom-built treatment wetland system and a suite of probe compounds that can be used to discriminate between different removal mechanisms, we will advance the state of science in treatment wetland design and operation. Experiments will be conducted to assess the role of macrophytes that serve as substrates for microorganisms in the biotransformation of wastewater-derived contaminants. By manipulating the types of plants and the rates at which carbon is delivered to the wetland, we hypothesize that it will be possible to enhance the attenuation of chemical contaminants. Experiments also will be conducted to assess the potential for operating shallow wetlands in a manner that enhances the removal of contaminants through photochemical reactions. By coupling wetland cells that rely upon different attenuation mechanisms, it will lead to the development of a low maintenance, inexpensive treatment system that effectively removes a broad suite of compounds.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project are related to two aspects of the research. First, the project will engage the community where the field experiments are being conducted by enlisting volunteers as research participants and as partners in communicating our findings to the public. If the research shows that effective treatment wetlands can be built, the town is likely to build a full-scale treatment wetland that will serve as a model for communities interested in sustainable solutions to challenges posed by wastewater-derived contaminants.

Their enzymes are critical to biofuel production. Despite their importance, there is little known about how many fungi obtain food. Mycorrhizal fungi obtain sugars from plants in exchange for helping their host plants take up nutrients, and saprotrophic fungi obtain their energy and nutrients from decomposition of dead organic matter. Whether fungi switch between nutritional strategies is a key question in the evolutionary ecology of fungi. Recently, measuring carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14 isotopes has been shown to reliably assess nutritional strategy, and therefore provides new opportunities to examine the evolution of nutritional strategies in fungi. This study will use archived fungi from Australia, Asia, and the US to conduct a broad survey of fungal nutritional strategies. A site-specific study at the Harvard Forest research site in Massachusetts will also be used to examine whether fungi can switch nutritional strategies. These studies will greatly expand knowledge on the links among fungal function, phylogeny, and ecology. The broader scientific impacts of the proposed research will result from integrating functional (isotopic) methods and genetic methods in a novel collaboration that should stimulate interest within the larger community of evolutionary biologists, ecologists, and mycologists. These methods could be readily expanded to Europe and Africa to include the global distribution of mushroom-producing fungi. This project will also incorporate current scientific research into specific educational activities designed to inspire future scientists including high school (fungal forays), college (Clark University's ACE Summer Institute, Research Experience for Undergraduates at Harvard Forest, the UNH Undergraduate Research Conference), and graduate students."

The PI and G. Neumann proved a conjecture by the astrophysicist S. Rhie that this number depends linearly, rather than quadratically; on n. (This result reduces substantially the number of relevant calculations for large n.) The PI, jointly with his student E. Lundberg, is planning to extend these ideas to a more realistic situation when the lensing effect is produced by an elliptical galaxy with an isothermal mass distribution of gas. Another main theme of this project develops further recent results of the PI obtained jointly with Bell, Ebenfelt and Shapiro, and, more recently, by the PI's student Lundberg, dealing with algebraic properties of solutions of the boundary value problems in potential theory. One of the main novel tools being developed in the project is the extension to the complex space of a notion of a ""lightning bolt"" pioneered by Arnold and Kolmogorov in the 1950s in their solution of the 13th Hilbert problem on superpositions of functions. Complex lightning bolts turn out to be precisely the obstacles preventing global analytic continuation of harmonic functions in two-dimensional complex space. The project also addresses several other fundamental long standing questions in complex analysis and potential theory.<br/><br/>A large part of the project has a strong interdisciplinary flavor. This research continues a deeper study of some problems in astrophysics, more precisely, in gravitational lensing. In particular, the project deals with the problems that have arisen from the PI?s recent work with the astrophysicists Fassnacht and Keeton. The PI is continuing popularization of some aspects of his research and is planning several articles directed at a wide audience. The PI has given in the past and will continue to give popular lectures for undergraduates based on the research topics of the project. The PI is working with a local high school student (M. Rabinovich), who was recently selected as a 2009 Intel Talent Search Competition finalist. The PI will be continuing his efforts in dissemination of his research and, at the same time, continuing to supervise Ph D students. The PI now has two students: one advanced and one in his second year. A beginning female graduate student has recently expressed interest in working with the PI on some of the topics in the project. The PI continues his fruitful collaborations on some parts of the project with researchers from underrepresented groups. The PI is also actively involved at various levels in organizing multiple events (conferences, workshops, etc.), on the research topics discussed in the proposal and in bringing together mathematicians and physicists in order to uphold the strong momentum of collaboration on several problems in this project."

Eight students will be selected each year to participate in an intensive 10-week research program in biodiversity-related and evolutionary biological research. The Field Museum houses one of the world's foremost scientific collections of biological diversity (>25 million specimens) and supports active biodiversity research around the globe. Despite the urgency of the current biodiversity crisis, few educational opportunities exist for students in the biological sciences to interact with scientists and institutions dedicated to the study of organic diversity. Each participant will undertake an independent research project supervised by a museum scientist in a discipline such as taxonomy and systematics, phylo/ biogeography, paleontology, molecular phylogenetics, or conservation. Students will experience biological diversity through the use of the museum's collections in their research and will be trained in project-relevant techniques and equipment such as the scanning electron microscope, various light microscopy set-ups, and equipment in the Pritzker DNA lab. A six-week course in phylogenetic systematics, run concurrently with intern projects, will provide a common theoretical framework for their research, and a symposium at the conclusion of the summer will allow students to present their results to their peers and museum scientists. Providing equal opportunity in biodiversity-related research is an important goal of the program.

The measurements will greatly advance our ability to predict the conditions under which magmas will rise buoyantly to the Earth's surface and erupt as lavas or form volcanoes. The measurements will also reveal the conditions and depths where magmas are too dense to rise to the surface, remaining either trapped by neutral buoyancy, or sinking further into our planet's deep interior. The experimental data will also provide new insight into the way in which the Earth was differentiated into crust, mantle, and core during its primordial formation stage. The collaborative effort combines experimental techniques that span the entire range of pressure and temperature conditions that exist for melting and magma production in the Earth. The highest pressures, simulating the deepest regions of Earth's mantle, will be done under dynamic compression at the Caltech Shockwave Laboratory, the intermediate pressures will be carried out under static compression in large presses at the University of New Mexico's High Pressure Laboratory, and the near-surface magmatic conditions will be studied in high temperature furnaces with ultrasonic techniques at the University of Michigan's Experimental Petrology Laboratory. <br/><br/>The new data will lead to the development of an empirically-based equation of state and a model for multicomponent silicate melts. This model should allow precise characterization of the locations of crystal/melt density crossovers in the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle, and D"" layer. This equation of state will be used in models of differentiation of a whole-mantle magma ocean or in defining the chemistry and dynamics of possible silicate melting at the modern core-mantle boundary. The investigators expect that the data will also provide the essential basis for development of next-generation melt models that encompass explicit speciation and/or non-ideal mixing terms. The data gathered under this proposal will be a precious resource for all future studies of melt properties and igneous differentiation at high pressure. Never before have such a wide range of techniques been applied to a common set of samples; together the complementary data sets will significantly enhance our understanding of magma physics within our planet."

It has been proposed that the extraction of <br/>water from the mantle at the onset of partial melting increases the viscosity of the residue so much <br/>that it can resist convection. While such a dehydrated rheological lithosphere (DRL) can impact a <br/>wide range of processes in mantle convection, the existence of a DRL has yet to be tested against ob- <br/>servations. The Iceland hotspot is an outstanding site to perform this test because here the thickness <br/>of the DRL is likely to be most distinct from that of the (thin) thermal lithosphere, there is a source of <br/>convective mantle flow, and the area has an extensive, high-quality seismic data set. The source of <br/>convective flow is imaged seismically beneath Iceland as a low-velocity body, which is widely be- <br/>lieved to be a hot, plume-like upwelling in the upper mantle. The plume hypothesis predicts this up- <br/>welling to feed rapid mantle flow laterally along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) but current seismic <br/>evidence for such a phenomenon is ambiguous. Arguments for a DRL come from geodynamic stud- <br/>ies of mantle plume-ridge interaction that require a DRL to hinder the rate of mantle upwell- <br/>ing/melting so as to successfully predict the thickness of Iceland?s crust. Seismic evidence, however, <br/>is contradictory. In support of a DRL, recent tomography studies reveal a layer of low velocities that <br/>extends south of Iceland with a width (>600 km) and thickness (>150 km) that are consistent with <br/>predictions of models with a DRL and distinguishably larger than those without one. The competing <br/>evidence comes from shear-wave splitting (SWS) and surface-wave measurements of seismic anisot- <br/>ropy that were interpreted to reflect crystallographic fabric due to shallow mantle flow, well within <br/>the hypothesized, non-convecting DRL. Anisotropy from SWS was also interpreted to be caused by <br/>large-scale mantle flow without the need of a mantle plume in the first place. <br/>The above goals motivate a new generation of seismic inversion scheme that directly tests the <br/>physical processes by integrating geodynamic models of mantle convection and seismic structure. <br/>Models of hotspot-ridge interaction will simulate a complete range of dynamic behaviors: from vig- <br/>orous (plume) to weak (non-plume) upwellings; and from cases with shallow lateral flow of low- <br/>viscosity mantle (no DRL) to deep lateral flow predicted for more viscous mantle (with a DRL). Pre- <br/>dicted patterns of crystallographic fabric, temperatures, and retained melt will then be used to com- <br/>pute 3D variations in elasticity tensors, from which we will generate synthetic seismograms. Misfits <br/>between the synthetic and real data will be used to identify the most and least probable geodynamics- <br/>based solutions. The ability to reject or confirm the mantle upwelling and along-axis flow that are <br/>predicted by plume theory will have broad importance to understanding hotspots. A positive test for a <br/>DRL will show that dehydration can dominate mantle rheology over a wide range of conditions, in- <br/>cluding the vigorous magmatism at Iceland. A negative result will lead to questions of the general <br/>importance of a DRL to mantle convection and could require a dramatic re-thinking of how melt is <br/>generated and transported along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. <br/>Broader Impacts: This project has strong outreach potential because the topic of the origin of <br/>hotspots has far reaching importance to understanding absolute plate motions, mantle convection, <br/>and surface volcanism. The study will also advance a new generation of geodynamic-based seismic <br/>solution methods. The numerical codes developed will be made available to the community, such as <br/>through collaboration with the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG). Benefits to the <br/>broader community include the training of a graduate student and a post-doctoral scholar in interdis- <br/>ciplinary geophysics research, and supporting ongoing outreach activities of the PIs. Both of our uni- <br/>versities are located in ethnically diverse communities and are important contributors to the social, <br/>cultural, scientific, and technical resources of their respective regions. The proposed research will <br/>enrich our teaching and research programs, and provide advanced technological training and mentor- <br/>ing of science students with diverse cultural backgrounds."

Now in its seventh production season and sixth year of daily PBS broadcast, Cyberchase has helped millions of children acquire a stronger foundation in mathematics. Cyberchase's content spans the 3rd-5th grade standards of the National Council of Mathematics, and targets children aged 8-11. The series goals include: 1) reinforce mathematical knowledge especially during the summer months; 2) expand opportunities for kids' involvement with Cyberchase math activities; 3) and inspire all children to approach math with enthusiasm and confidence. Ancillary materials, outreach, and a highly popular Web site extend the learning and help make Cyberchase the sole mathematics media project available for the target age group. The new season will build on the successful format to model effective problem-solving processes, expand the math-rich Web site and bring Cyberchase to today's new-media platforms to prompt children to do math. Season 8 will especially target the summer, when children's TV viewing goes up, informal educators provide special offerings, and children, especially the under-served, are at risk of losing math growth made during the school year. The Summer Challenge will create a first-ever math summer campaign for PBS Kids. Cyberchase is watched by four million viewers each week. The audience is 40% minority and includes equal numbers of girls and boys. Cyberchase Online receives 1.9 visits a month. The project summative evaluation will study the outcomes and impact on (a) the target-age children (conducted by Multimedia Research) as well as (b) 8 PBS stations and local partners, culminating in a white paper on best practices for presenting informal STEM education in the summer (conducted by RMC Research).

Some argue that New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) known from 16-20 million year old rocks of Patagonia predate the origins of the modern families, that is, they are 'stem platyrrhines'. Others argue that they are early representatives of the modern platyrrhine families. The two alternative interpretations have profound implications for how the evolutionary radiation of platyrrhines is viewed. Further fossil material of early platyrrhines will contribute to resolving this debate. A joint team of US and Argentine paleontologists will search for fossil primates in ~16 million-year-old rocks of the Santa Cruz Formation and its equivalents in Patagonian Argentina. Collecting will concentrate on proven localities and expand collecting efforts to other lesser-known sites said to be richly fossiliferous from the Atlantic coast inland to the Andean front at 50-55 degrees South latitude. <br/>Analysis of the existing materials and recovery of even more complete specimens of primates will offer a rare insight about the phylogeny and adaptations of these early anthropoid primates. A phylogenetic analysis will clarify the pattern of diversification of South American platyrrhine monkeys and help to refine hypotheses about the origins of the modern platyrrhines families. To reconstruct adaptive profile of the various extinct species, a team of scientists from the US, Argentina and Brazil will study various aspects of the teeth, skulls and limb bones to reconstruct important details of the each species' adaptation and life history. <br/>Collections of other faunal remains by the field group will fill out the environmental context in which early platyrrhines evolved. A second team of research specialists headed by the Argentine scientists will study the functional anatomy and ecomorphology of non-primate fossils. Much work already has been undertaken to study the sloths and armadillos. Using these established approaches as a model, the research group will extend this work to encompass other major mammal groups including rodents, notoungulates, and marsupials."

Specifically, studies will focus on the spatial and temporal regulation of translation that underlies basal body formation and nuclear remodeling in the spermatids. Spermatogenesis in this fern is a process that is activated by placing dry spores into water and involves a series of nine rapid cell division cycles in precise planes within the spore wall to produce 32 spermatids and 7 sterile cells. There is no movement of cells, so size and position within the spore wall defines cell fate. Gametophyte development takes place in the absence of new transcription; instead, the gametes are formed with proteins that were already present in the spore, or translated from mRNAs that had been transcribed and stored prior to spore desiccation. Within the spermatids, differentiation involves the formation of basal bodies in the absence of preexisting centrioles in a unique particle known as a blepharoplast. The spermatids then form an elaborate signature microtubule cytoskeleton known as the multilayered structure (MLS). The later phases of spermatid maturation involve nuclear remodeling, cell reshaping, and finally ciliogenesis, to produce a multiciliated, spirally-shaped motile gamete that looks nothing like the cell that gave rise to it. None of these events occurs in the sterile cells, though all of the cells present within the spore wall arose from the same progenitor. Thus, the male gametophyte of Marsilea provides a unique opportunity to study multiple aspects of cellular differentiation in populations of synchronously developing cells, where the cells are permeable to the entry of macromolecules at the time the spores are placed into water. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) determine how the core components of the exon junction complex affect patterns of centrin translation essential for the process of de novo basal body formation; (2) characterize the RNA-binding proteins that regulate the abundance of alpha-tubulin, which, together with centrin, affects basal body production and formation of the MLS; and (3) determine how spermidine affects temporal and spatial patterns of translation, thereby influencing cell fate specification within the gametophyte.<br/><br/>This project will provide research training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral associates and visiting scholars. In addition, laboratory courses have been developed that provide training in cell biology and microscopy for undergraduate and graduate students and a website focused on an ""Introduction to Mitosis"" has been developed and is accessible by the public at http://www.life.umd.edu/CBMG/faculty/wolniak/wolniakmitosis.html."

It examines this phenomenon on a comparative transnational scale through an historical analysis of the transference and adaptation of informal methods of dispute resolution; in particular, the common-law process of arbitration. This project employs the historical case-study method to examine these issues in the context of Great Britain's acquisition of colonial territory in India. As Britain's empire expanded, arbitration quickly became an important aspect of imperial rule because it served a number of useful purposes, including the reduction of judicial expenses and the encouragement of the participation of local elites. Most importantly, common-law arbitration appeared to correspond to an indigenous form of dispute resolution, the tribal and caste panchayats, and thus was perceived as a bridge between the two legal cultures. As British arbitration practices were adapted for use in India, Indian arbitrators were given broad powers to resolve local disputes. Through the analysis of these decisions, this project will therefore help to uncover not only how legal processes adapted to one another, but also how commonplace methods of dispute resolution expressed contemporary ideas of what is just and what is fair."

Glutathione (GSH) is a small molecule made from common amino acids that is key in protecting plants and animals from many toxic chemicals, and the GSH-ascorbate cycle detoxifies dangerous oxygen radicals. Creating plants that are more resistant to environmental stresses and therefore crops that maintain their yields under unfavorable conditions, requires detailed knowledge of how GSH levels are controlled, both through how it is made and how it is broken down. While a lot is known about GSH synthesis and regulation, very little is known about how GSH is broken down. This Arabidopsis 2010 research project investigates a newly discovered enzyme activity, termed gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase, which experiments suggest catalyzes a majority of GSH break down in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Experiments in this project will define the gene and protein that are responsible for this enzyme activity in plants. A combination of protein chemistry and genomics techniques will be employed to identify the gene in Arabidopsis. Subsequent genetic experiments will be used to verify that the isolated gene is responsible for GSH turnover and how GSH turnover is regulated relative to synthesis. Information gained will enable experiments designed to engineer or select plants with elevated potential for defending themselves from environmental threats. In addition, because GSH is found in all organisms, discovery of a new branch in the pathway of GSH metabolism is transformative with regard to understanding how all organisms survive in an oxygen containing environment.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>To benefit the research community, data and information generated through this project will be made available through the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR: www.arabidopsis.org). Seed stocks and any unique DNA materials will be made available through ABRC (http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~plantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm). To enhance education, the project will engage undergraduate students in research and professional development activities that are designed to expose them to advanced biotechnology, and enable them to continue careers in STEM disciplines. A postdoctoral research associate will be trained in research and mentoring, in preparation for a faculty career. In addition, undergraduates will work with the PI and the postdoctoral associate to develop a module on mitochondria to be included in the ""Meta!Blast"" virtual 3D cell, a web-based video environment designed to teach the basics of plant cell biology to precollege and beginning college students."

It is also supported by the joint initiative with Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate: Research at the Interface of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences and Society. One goal of the project is to provide a critical scrutiny of one perspective on fundamental science so as to make way for an alternative. A widely prevalent image of science, which has influenced the thinking of many scientists and the general public, pictures scientific knowledge as hierarchically organized. At the base of the hierarchy is physics, applicable to objects and processes at all length and energy scales. The other sciences, which concern themselves with kinds of system (chemical, biological, psychological, social, economic) that become manifest only in special circumstances, are regarded as being based on ""fundamental"" physics.<br/><br/>The traditional hierarchy based on ""fundamental"" physics is organized in accordance with three principles: (1) Everything is composed of basic microphysical elements, (2) All properties of objects are wholly determined by the basic intrinsic properties and relations of these basic microphysical elements, and (3) All laws and/or theories governing the behavior of composite objects ultimately reduce to the fundamental laws/theories governing the behavior of their microphysical constituents. Taken together, these principles would warrant the belief that the basic laws that govern the behavior of the ultimate constituents of matter are in fact responsible for the behavior of everything. They provide an image of the physical world as constructed out of basic building blocks?basic objects, basic properties and basic laws. This research subjects each of these organizing principles of the traditional hierarchy to critical examination and explores ways of getting along without that hierarchy.<br/><br/>The current project builds on previous research undermining the principle that the properties of all objects are determined by those of their ultimate constituents. Physicists commonly talk of elementary particles and their associated quantum fields. But it turns out that there are strong reasons to doubt these could play the role of ultimate constituents of matter. Even if such objects were available to serve as building blocks, they do not compose the objects of condensed matter physics in any simple way. Though quantum (field) theories are extremely predictively successful, it has proved extraordinarily hard to interpret them as offering a self-contained description of the world at a fundamental level. If this is not possible, then the laws of fundamental physics as currently conceived cannot be responsible for the behavior of everything. This suggests a revised image of physics (if not all of science) as successfully modeling structures in various domains by a network of theories, loosely connected by diverse and domain-specific logical and ontological relations."

Taking advantage of their small feature sizes, miniaturized analytical systems provide for small sample volume, highly parallel processes and thus good multi-analyte detection capabilities. It is a well-established research field with many systems described in literature based on various detection and recognition principles. Remaining key challenges are the integration with sample preparation and sample concentration steps. The ability to identify an analyte in a complex mixture of compounds is challenging for any detection system and needs to rely in part on the biorecognition molecule's ability to specifically bind and or react with its analyte. However, fouling of microchannels and the need for automated separation of the analyte out of its matrix renders it even more complicated for microsystems. <br/><br/>Electrospinning is a fiber formation process that relies on electrical rather than mechanical forces to form nano and microscale (100 nm to 10 microns) fibers. The fibers can be electrospun directly onto a conductive surface such as copper and gold. It is proposed to investigate the possibility to incorporate electrospun nanofibers for sample purification and analyte concentration within polymethyl methacrylate microfluidic channels. First, nanofibers will be spun within the channel, across the channel and along the channel length providing 3D structures with high surface to volume ratios within a polymer microchannel. Solvent bonding of the nanofibers to the channel surfaces will be studied and the strength of their attachment will be measured. Conductive nanofibers containing carbon nanotubes will be spun and investigated for amperometric and electrochemiluminescence reactions. Second, biorecognition elements will be included into the nanofibers (conductive and non-conductive) prior to the spinning process using streptavidin and DNA probes as models. These functional bionanofibers will be characterized physically using a variety of spectroscopy and microscopy techniques as well as tensile testing techniques to confirm successful incorporation of biological molecules, effect of this incorporation on fiber morphology and mechanical properties and to determine the location of the biological molecules within the fibers. The nanofibers will be characterized with respect to their biological recognition ability using liposome hybridization and binding assays developed previously in our labs. Third, these functional fibers bonded in microchannels will be studied as bioseparators; as electrodes; 3D guiding lines and concentrators and will be combined with nanofibers with negative and positive surface charges, with hydrophobic, hydrophilic surfaces. <br/><br/>The scientific merit of the proposal lies in the study of the integration of nanofibers with polymer-based microfluidic channels and their use as biofunctional nanofibers. Short term goals include the study of electrospinning conditions on the stability of streptavidin and DNA probes, their effective presentation on the surface of the nanofibers and usefulness as bioseparators and concentrators. Long term goals will broaden the technology to other protein and nucleic acid molecules, will result in an understanding of biorecognition molecule activities in embedded situations. It is postulated that protein molecules would be more stable when encapsulated in fibers than when in solution or surface-immobilized. Finally, complex 3D bioseparators and concentrators can be designed based on these initial findings. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed research will be its direct applicability to on-site and lab-based diagnostic tests for clinical, food, environmental and biosecurity applications. Two graduate and at least four undergraduate students involved in the research will obtain cross-disciplinary training in fiber science, biology and nanotechnology engineering. High school students from the Cornell New Visions program will participate in research throughout the academic year, seniors from Onondaga Tribe high schools will be recruited for summer internships. A high school teacher and additional undergraduate students will be incorporated into the program via Cornell Center for Materials Research programs."

This novel steel will be synthesized using the concept of austempered ductile cast iron technology and by applying a novel concept of adiabatic deformation together with a two-step austempering process in a medium carbon low alloy steel with high silicon content. This novel process will result in extremely fine bainitic ferrite and carbon stabilized austenite which will in turn provide simultaneous high yield strength, fracture toughness, impact strength and fatigue strength. Currently such combination of unique properties can not be obtained in conventional low alloy steels.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will pioneer a novel technology for creation of a series of Ausferritic Steels with excellent combination of mechanical properties. It will establish whether a combination of adiabatic deformation and two-step austempering will lead to large super cooling and carbon partitioning, and thus lead to an extremely fine scale bainitic ferrite and carbon stabilized austenite. Moreover it will validate whether such a microstructure will impart the desired combination of mechanical properties i.e. simultaneous high yield strength, fatigue strength, fracture toughness and impact strength. The creation of Ausferritic steel will be totally new and a novel concept. The concept of Ausferritic steel will make a valuable contribution to the theory of phase transformation in ferrous alloys. In addition to this, we have also developed a thermodynamic model and the assumptions made in derivation of this thermodynamic model will also be examined. Thus this proposed research will advance the state of knowledge in the ferrous physical metallurgy as well as basic thermodynamics and kinetics of phase transformation. This novel steel will make the structural components lighter, more energy efficient and consequently improve fuel economy and reduce pollution. This novel process will also lead to a near net shape production technology for steels. The austempering process is a more energy efficient heat treatment process since no post heat treatment after quenching is required. Therefore, this process will lead to significant energy savings."

Prochlorococcus carries out the first step of carbon dioxide fixation in a specialized organelle called the carboxysome. Carboxysomes are self-assembling metabolic modules, composed entirely of protein. Although the polyhedral shape of carboxysomes has been well documented by electron microscopy, their protein composition is known for only a few non-photosynthetic model organisms. Structural studies that address the relationship between carboxysome architecture, which appears to differ among high and low-light adapted Prochlorococcus strains, and its role in enhancing the catalytic efficiency of the carbon dioxide-fixing enzyme (RubisCO) that it encapsulates, have only recently been initiated. We will focus on two Prochlorococcus model strains, MIT9313 and MED4, which represent important ecotypes that have distinct physiological characteristics and ecological distributions. Our preliminary data suggest that MIT9313 and MED4 have evolved key structural and compositional differences in their carboxysomes, and these differences are expected to impact carboxysome function and thus, the carbon fixation capabilities of these strains. In order to achieve an integrative understanding of the role played by carboxysomes in carbon metabolism in these Prochlorococcus strains, we are combining biochemical, biophysical and genetic approaches to analyze interactions between carboxysome components and to examine the relationship between structure and function of individual proteins and of the entire carboxysome. This includes purification of carboxysomes from both Prochlorococcus strains, characterization of their specific protein composition, and the use of recombinant proteins to determine the structures and test the functions of individual carboxysome gene products. Moreover, these data will be placed in physiological and ecological contexts via a combination of in vivo gene and protein expression studies under different environmental conditions and metagenomic surveying of content and expression of genes involved in carbon fixation in the open ocean. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>Our research will advance our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which Prochlorococcus concentrates and fixes carbon dioxide in the oceans. Furthermore, this study will contribute to our knowledge of the contribution of carboxysomes to optimized carbon fixation by autotrophic bacteria in the water column. This multi-disciplinary research project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the PIs in microbial ecology and physiology, structural biology, biochemistry, molecular biology and bioinformatics. We expect our study to reveal novel insights into the role of carboxysome architecture in optimizing carbon dioxide fixation in the open ocean. This could lead to optimization of or design of other specialized bacterial organelles to enhance carbon dioxide fixation. Undergraduate students will be involved in analyzing DNA sequence and expression data from an ocean survey. The project will provide interdisciplinary training and networking opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students including women and members of under-represented minorities at the three cooperating institutions."

The core of this proposal addresses three questions. The first one aims to understand domains in higher dimensional Euclidean spaces in terms of their harmonic measure as it has been done in 2 dimensions with great success. The underlying thesis is that in higher dimensions GMT plays the role that complex analysis does in 2 dimensions. The second question is that of the existence and regularity of minimizers for variational problems stated in terms of H\""older continuous metrics rather than smooth metrics. This problem includes the understanding of the structure of the corresponding free boundary. A by-product of this, is a question concerning the regularity of quasi-minimizers of the functional studied by Alt and Caffarelli. The third question goes back to a long term interest of the PI concerning the existence of good parameterization for subsets of Euclidean space. A remarkable feature is that this last project, which is purely in geometry, was motivated by an attempt to answer a question in potential theory. <br/>The cross-pollenization between harmonic analysis and GMT has been clearly beneficial to both areas.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The theory of calculus of variations has been the main theoretical tool used in the study of variational problems often concerning energy minimization. Energy minimization methods are used to understand the equilibrium configuration of molecules. The basic idea is that a stable state of a molecular system should correspond to a local minimum of their potential energy. The proposed research provides new outlets for GMT, a field of Mathematics that has contributed greatly to the development of the calculus of variations and geometric analysis. The transformative aspect of this grant is the invigoration of this fundamental area of Mathematics. In the last few years, the number of students going into GMT in the US, has greatly diminished while it has increased in Europe. An important feature of the proposed work is that, while some results have already been obtained, there is great potential for expansion.

The field, which has been one of the pillars upon of which some areas of geometric analysis have been built, offers the theoretical framework to study a wide array of variational problems coming from different venues of science."

Some prepositions behave like function words (""to"" and ""of""), and others more like content words (""in"" and ""on""). While young children produce these words, research on natural speech finds the types differentiated by onset and errors. The general pattern of function elements missing from children's early sentences, a pattern with intriguing variation across languages, could reflect limitations either in linguistic representations or in the processing of those representations. The dissertation experiments probe both comprehension and production in order to compare these different accounts. Icelandic uses word endings to indicate the information that English does with the prepositions under investigation. Developmentally equivalent learners of English and Icelandic are therefore expected to perform differently.<br/><br/>Standard models of language production are well tested by natural and experimental data from normally functioning and impaired adults. But developmental predictions from these models are rarely articulated or tested. Likewise, children's earliest utterances are more often studied with the tools of corpus analysis. Experiments rarely focus on function elements in speakers who use them inconsistently. This research is thus methodologically unusual. It also has potential application to impaired populations. The more detailed our understanding of early language production, the better we will be able to distinguish normal from non-normal error in such populations. Finally, the Icelandic component will enhance the partnership between language acquisition laboratories at the University of Arizona and the University of Iceland. While in Reykjavik, co-PI Nicholas will contribute to training faculty and students there who are newly interested in psycholinguistics. This will broaden the empirical options for Icelandic linguists who are studying variation in their language."

They also have tremendous conservation value and support most remaining large native grazing animals in the world, particularly in Africa. A fundamental understanding of the factors most important for sustaining savanna grasslands, including their natural fire and grazing regimes, is required for their management and conservation. Scientists have questioned whether grasslands in different regions function similarly. Convergence in functioning would mean that ecological understanding and conservation strategies could be generalized for savanna grasslands worldwide. But contingent factors specific to a region, such as differences in evolutionary history or the types of grazers present, may lead to unique responses in some savanna grasslands. The goal of this research is to compare responses of key ecological processes to fire and grazing in North American and South African savanna grasslands. Scientists will take advantage of three ongoing, long-term experiments that manipulate fire return interval and the presence of large grazers. Responses of plant productivity, plant diversity and nutrient cycling will be compared, and the mechanisms underlying responses, such as differences in plant traits or evolutionary histories, will be assessed. <br/><br/>Comparative research elucidating the consequences of human alterations of fire and grazing regimes worldwide is needed to enable development of management strategies that can insure the sustainability of ecologically and economically important savanna grasslands. This research will provide the basic knowledge necessary to do so, as well as afford training and important global and cultural experiences for young scientists, graduate students and undergraduates. Finally, though collaborations that are already established, results will be made available to scientists and managers in South Africa."

Studies utilize a well-described neural circuit controlling learned birdsong, and will investigate brain mechanisms that promote behavioral change when auditory feedback from an animal's vocalizations deviates from previously learned patterns. The focus is on a forebrain circuit implicated in motor learning across a wide range of vertebrates. Lesions and/or reversible neuronal inactivation will be used to determine if this forebrain circuit is directly responsible for vocal experimentation when auditory feedback signals the need for vocal change. Also, neuroanatomical measures will establish if such feedback-driven behavioral plasticity entails changes in neuronal connections within motor pathways, and whether the propensity for such neural change decreases in older animals. The project will provide training in behavioral, neuropharmacological, and neuroanatomical methods for both undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, knowledge derived from these studies will find its way quickly into the classroom, as the investigators are involved heavily in both undergraduate and graduate neuroscience programs. The broad aims are to understand better how the brain evaluates the consequences of behavior, and to identify some of the mechanisms it uses to adaptively adjust behavior. This information will provide insights into general mechanisms of motor learning and development, as well as adult neural and behavioral plasticity. The work should impact a variety of disciplines ranging from cognitive and sensory-motor neuroscience to neural reorganization."

The development of new methods to identify protein structural changes that facilitate chemical reactions will have a transformative effect on our understanding of biological catalysis. Photosynthetic reaction centers provide an example of biological reactions in which protein dynamics play an important role and in which the reactions are light-inducible. Therefore, the photosynthetic reactions serve as a model system in which kinetic mechanism can be investigated using laser flashes to synchronize and start reactions. To identify protein structural changes important in catalysis, novel, time-resolved spectroscopic studies of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in photosystem II (PSII) will be conducted. PSII consists both of integral, membrane-spanning subunits and of extrinsic subunits. The OEC contains a tetranuclear manganese (Mn) cluster and accumulates the four photon-derived oxidizing equivalents necessary for oxygen production from water. The sequentially oxidized forms of the catalytic site are called the Sn states, where n refers to the number of oxidizing equivalents stored. Chloride plays an important but not completely understood role in the S state cycle. Despite decades of study, many aspects of the water oxidation mechanism remain to be elucidated. The intellectual merit of these activities is that new fundamental understandings of the role of protein dynamics in catalysis will result. The photosynthetic oxygen-evolving reactions are responsible for the maintenance of aerobic life on earth and thus are of intrinsic importance in biological chemistry. These reactions also serve as a model of other enzymatic reactions involving molecular oxygen. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:<br/>The broader impact of these activities results from the advancement of teaching, training, and learning, as well as from broadening the scientific participation of underrepresented groups.

Higher degree equations remained a mystery. A breakthrough came in 19th century when Galois, a French mathematician, introduced a new tool, a group of permutations of the set of roots of a polynomial equation. This object, now called Galois group, expresses the nature of the polynomial equation in subtle ways. In particular, it gives a criterion whether the equation can be solved in terms of radicals. Fast forward to 20th century. Due to efforts of hundreds of mathematicians, a classification of finite simple groups has been obtained. A natural question is which of these groups appear as Galois groups. In a couple of recent works, C. Khare, M.

This project examines those services provided by the high altitude páramo grasslands of the northern Andes. The concept of Payment for Ecosystem Services is being implemented in Ecuador, leading to tree planting in páramo grasslands to sequester carbon and alteration of traditional burning and grazing regimes to enhance water resources. However, the biophysical outcomes of these and related changes in land use and management are poorly understood, and in some cases well-intended changes may not be producing the desired outcomes. In this project, the researchers will systematically investigate the effects of land use change on the production of soil-related ecosystem services, quantify potential tradeoffs among ecosystem services, and evaluate policy implications of different land management strategies. The primary objectives are 1) to determine how land use change affects carbon storage, water storage, and water transmission in Andean páramo soils and 2) to evaluate which land uses maximize ecosystem services related to both carbon and water in páramo grassland soils. The researchers will integrate field observations and in situ experiments at two páramo study sites, Zuleta (northern Ecuador) and the Nudo del Azuay (southern Ecuador), with laboratory analyses of soil samples, and assessment of synergies, trade-offs, and relevant policies to quantify and predict effects of land use change on carbon- and water-related ecosystem services. <br/><br/>This research will provide essential data for predicting ecosystem responses to land use change and will have immediate societal application by improving the scientific basis for Payment for Ecosystem Services programs.

Specifically, a novel manufacturing process, termed as the Integrated Mechanical and Thermal Activation (IMTA) process, will be utilized to make low cost nanostructured WC/Co powder which will subsequently be densified using the innovative sintering strategy to allow the conversion of nano-WC particles to submicrometer-sized WC platelets. The dense WC/Co cermets with submicrometer-sized WC platelets are expected to offer unprecedented simultaneous improvements in hardness and toughness. To achieve the best improvements, WC platelets will be fabricated to have both high aspect ratio and thin thickness. The thin thickness will limit the slip distance of dislocations and thus provide high hardness, while the high aspect ratio of platelets will offer effective crack deflection and thus result in high toughness. Thin and high aspect ratio WC platelets will be produced via detailed and comprehensive studies of the effects of sintering conditions, the size of the starting WC particles, the Co concentration, the free carbon concentration, and addition of a small amount of dopants. The microstructure of WC/Co with and without doping sintered under various conditions will be characterized in detail to elucidate the formation mechanism of WC platelets and the effect of various dopants and processing conditions. Deliverables include mechanistic understanding of the effects of sintering conditions, the size of the starting WC particles, the Co concentration, the free carbon concentration, and a small amount of dopants on the formation of WC platelets, dense WC/Co cermets with simultaneous improvements in hardness and toughness, engineering students education, and research experience for middle/high school underrepresented minority students.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will produce a new generation of low cost and high performance WC/Co cermets with superior hardness and toughness for advanced structural applications by many industries. These novel WC/Co cermets could also open up new opportunities in areas outside their current application windows. The understanding developed from this research will lay a scientific foundation for enhancing anisotropic growth of crystals and can be applied directly to other hardmetals such as WC-Ni, WC-NiCo, and WC-CoCr. The scientific principles discovered can also shed light on the processing and microstructure design of advanced ceramics with the anisotropic grain growth property (e.g., Ti3SiC2, Ti3AlC2, and liquid-phase-sintered Si3N4, SiC and Al2O3). Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit from this project through classroom instruction and involvement in the research. Through specially designed summer programs, middle/high school underrepresented minority students will participate in the research. These summer programs will nurture underrepresented minorities towards positive thinking, increase their interest in science and technology, and motivate them to pursue higher education and become future leaders of the society."

It is widely recognized that whoever discovers and controls the optimized synthesis of novel materials generally controls the investigation of their often unique properties and, ultimately, their successful integration into advanced technologies. Unfortunately, U.S. leadership in materials research has seriously eroded in recent years due to a growing shortage of scientists who possess skills in both the synthesis and characterization of new materials. The current situation presents an urgent national challenge that could ultimately undermine our economic competitiveness if left unaddressed. The proposed research is to build upon our recent success on new materials studies and emphasize the synthesis and characterization of novel materials in bulk-single-crystal form and a rigorous search for new materials.

Spin valves or more generally spintronic (magnetoelectronic) materials not only have technological potential as magnetic field sensors and read-heads for computer hard drives, but also present fundamental challenges to the theory of magnetotransport in solids. These are among the most intensively studied phenomena in materials physics and engineering due to their enormous potential impact on a $100-billion-per-year electronics industry.

Moss of Rutgers University who will study carbenes, diazirines, and other reactive species by fast and ultrafast spectroscopic methods. These studies are intended to correlate molecular structure with the reaction channels of highly reactive, short-lived organic intermediates. Novel syntheses will also be developed for diazirine precursors of carbenes. Target areas will include the measurement of activation parameters for carbene-alkene additions and the interplay of enthalpy and entropy in these additions; spectroscopic studies of carbene solvation; and the chemistry of incarcerated carbenes. Difluorocarbene will be generated from difluorodiazirine, and the absolute kinetics of its additions to alkenes will be determined. Activation parameters for alkene additions will be measured by nanosecond laser flash photolysis (LFP) for phenylchlorocarbene, dichlorocarbene, fluorochlorocarbene, methoxychlorocarbene, phenylfluorocarbene, difluorocarbene, methoxyfluorocarbene, methylmethoxycarbene, phenylmethoxycarbene, and dimethoxycarbene. A fundamental and synoptic picture of carbene-alkene addition reactions will be constructed and parallel computational studies will be conducted.<br/><br/>Research by Professor Moss in the previous award period has contributed to the training of five undergraduates (2 females, 3 males), three graduate students (2 females and one African American), and six postdoctoral students (one female, 5 males). In addition to the training of a diverse group of students, Professor Moss has produced scholarly reviews that permit amplification of his NSF-sponsored research and thus reach a wider segment of the chemical community. During his most recent grant period, he published two well-received, co-edited books on the chemistry of reactive intermediates. In addition, he authored four reviews dealing with the chemistry of singlet carbenes; the synthesis of diazirines; SNi fragmentation reactions; and new mechanisms in carbene and diazirine chemistry. The publication of scholarly reviews will continue, with future topics to include the fragmentation of carbenes, the interplay of enthalpy and entropy in carbene-alkene additions, and the synthesis of dihalodiazirines."

For example, there are several variable time scales in the learning of motor skills, including the cyclical processes within a trial, the duration of a trial, the rest interval between trials, the number and timing of practice sessions in a day, and the distribution of practice sessions over days, weeks, months and years. These time scale relations are explored using both theoretical and empirical approaches. The project investigates 1)the influence of practice schedules on changes in learning dynamics in relation to the well known trade-off between speed and accuracy; 2) the time scales of temporary (adaptation) and persistent (learning) change; and 3) the changes in characteristic dynamic properties of learning that arise from different phasing of practice schedules in relation to the circadian cycle. One anticipated outcome is a new theory of practice that is relevant to instructional and practice strategies for enhancing performance in human motor skills in a number of contexts including human factors, music, physical activity and sport, in addition to the relearning of physical activities as in rehabilitation and physical therapy."

This graded vector space has a lot of structure, in particular that of a ring coming from the simple tensor product. This bears a striking resemblance to the ""canonical ring"" of algebraic geometry.<br/>Indeed it has been shown that the completion of this canonical ring gives a canonical subfactor whose standard invariant is the same as the original one! This structure will be explored in all its detail, especially the planar algbra structure on the standard invariant which is used to describe and analyse the canonical ring. Various combinatorial structures such as Hadamard matrices and Latin squares give rise to these canonical rings but there are serious problems of computational complexity. The large n limit of random nxn matrices also gives such structures. Technically the tensor product over N referred to above is the Connes tensor product and we are looking at how this tensor product may be directly relevant to quantum physics.<br/><br/> Fock space is the mathematical engine of second quantization, a process that, among other things, is necessary to make quantum mechanics compatible with special relativity. There are fermionic and bosonic versions. In our research we are pursuing a more general Fock space based on a subalgebra and an algebra.<br/>The small algebra corresponds to the scalars in second quantization and the large one corresponds to the first quantized Hilbert space.<br/>One can no longer freely exchange particles as in the fermionic and bosonic situations. But annihilation and creation operators still exist and form a ring analogous to the canonical ring of a projective variety. In our situation the canonical ring/Fock space has much more structure, namely that of a planar algebra. Roughly speaking this gives operations for every map. <br/>Imagine the map of a country like the United States. Upon putting an element of the Fock space into each State on the map one would get an output for the whole country, which is another element of the Fock space. To say that our structure is a planar algebra means that such an operation on Fock space exists for every conceivable map that can be drawn on a piece of paper."

In particular, the project focuses on microtubules, which are elongated polymers that provide architecture for the nerve and also act as railways to move proteins and structures down the nerve. For the nerve to grow and branch, there must be mobility within the microtubule array itself. Notably, it has been discovered in recent years that only the shortest microtubules in the nerves are mobile. To generate more mobility within the microtubule array, nerves use special proteins that cut long microtubules into short ones. The purpose of this project is to study how these microtubule ""cutters"" work, and how they are controlled to get their job done properly. The cutting of microtubules is also important for many other types of cells, so the studies will be of interest and importance across various fields of biology. The general approach will be to make cultures of rat neurons, and then use reliable methods to alter the microtubule cutting proteins, and then see what the effects are on microtubules and the shape of the nerves. The results are expected to show what other molecules and mechanisms the neuron uses to control the cutting proteins so they cut microtubules at the right time and place in the nerves. Broad impact will be achieved through strong efforts to recruit minority students into the graduate program at Drexel University. Even broader impact will be achieved by an outreach to scientists and students in the developing nations of Africa. The Principal Investigator will work with African partners to develop strategies for bringing African students to the USA for part of their training so that the students can prosper, upon their return to their home countries."

The first project develops new approaches to the modeling of decision making subject to temptation. The idea is that a person views his/her own future self as driven by currently unknown 'desires' which may conflict with the person's current view of what he wishes to consume. Surprisingly, this approach turns out to be mathematically equivalent to alternative recent approaches where the person expects his future self to choose what to consume to maximize his current utility subject to certain 'self control' costs. The second project studies implementation with evidence. More precisely, the PI and his collaborator consider the optimal design of social institustions when agents may posess evidence to back up their claims. They show that the use of evidence has dramatic effects on what can be achieved via appropriately designed institutions. Since virtually all work on this topic has ignored the possible availability of evidence, these results have important implications for rethinking the theory of optimal institutional design.<br/><br/>This project is basic research in economic theory. It has broader impacts because it adds to a toolkit that researchers in economics, business, political science, and law can use to build models that incorporate important aspects of human behavior."

The second goal is to design, train and validate sequence-based discriminative and generative models of nucleosome positioning. The third goal is to apply the trained models to data from a variety of organisms and human cell lines, with the goal of understanding how the nucleosome positioning signal encoded in the DNA interacts with other nucleosome positioning factors and which aspects of the nucleosome positioning signal are most strongly conserved, and which vary in divergent species.

Existing engineering models simply fit the open circuit voltage empirically and postulate dynamics by linear diffusion of intercalated lithium, but recent experiments contradict this picture for phase-separating materials. In contrast, the team will develop robust mathematical models to predict the voltage and current response over the full range of operating conditions. The basis for modeling at the single-crystal level will be Cahn-Hilliard partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, expressing chemical-potential dependent reaction reactions. The goal will be to provide the first mathematical description of emerging high-rate materials, where phase transformations occur via nonlinear intercalation waves, coupling anisotropic diffusion and electrochemical reactions. This effort will also raise basic mathematical questions in linear and nonlinear stability, degenerate wave solutions, and numerical methods.<br/><br/>In spite of extensive engineering over the past few decades, the performance of rechargeable batteries has improved only incrementally. Power density (charge/discharge rate per unit mass) and cycle life must still improve drastically for applications such as electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, and this will require a better fundamental understanding of how ions are inserted and extracted from porous electrodes. To meet this need, the project creates a Focused Research Group from mathematics, chemical engineering, and materials science to develop a new theoretical paradigm for Li-ion batteries. The group will guide the engineering of new ultrafast Li-ion batteries, capable of charging and discharging in seconds rather than hours, while opening fruitful directions for applied mathematics.

Hox genes are master regulators of body pattern, specifying anterior-posterior anatomical structures along the body axis of all animals. The Hox genes encode transcription factors that activate downstream genes required for proper embryonic development along the anterior-posterior body axis. However, it is not clear how specific Hox proteins regulate distinct downstream genes because they all bind to similar DNA sequences in their target genes. Likewise, it is not clear how such highly conserved factors generate the diversity of animal body forms observed throughout nature. What is clear is that these genes specify similar body parts in diverse species and also contribute to developmental defects and cancers when miss-expressed in the wrong tissues. With this award, the Mahaffey lab will study how Hox proteins integrate with other transcription factors to specify body patterns, using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. Drosophila has proved to be an excellent model for biomedical research. In their studies, the Mahaffey lab is taking a two-pronged approach. One relies on the extensive genetic tools developed in the fruit fly to discover molecular processes of developmental regulation by Hox genes. The other involves taking a less-standard, population genetics approach for systems biological studies.

Very little is known about how plants will contend with these changes, particularly species that are difficult to study, such as long-lived tropical trees. This project examines short-term physiological responses and the potential for long-term evolutionary changes in response to experimental manipulations of precipitation in populations of a tropical oak species that occur in different climates in Central America. The project investigates the extent to which these populations are adapted to the climate they currently experience and their potential response to climates that are similar to those predicted for the future. New insights will be gained as to whether impacts of climate change at the seedling stage enhance or constrain adaptation at later life stages of the tree. In addition, the research will identify the physiological and genetic mechanisms that enhance or limit adaptation to altered climates in this tropical tree. The project fosters the education, mentoring, and training of undergraduates, doctoral students, and a postdoctoral associate in plant ecological physiology and quantitative genetics at the University of Minnesota and at the University of Zamorano (Honduras). This work offers unique training and mentoring opportunities for Latin American undergraduates and para-taxonomists in Honduras and Costa Rica. It will also develop a collaborative, interdisciplinary network between researchers at the University of Minnesota, Cornell University, the University of Zamorano in Honduras, the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste in Costa Rica, and the Center for Ecosystem Studies (CIEco-UNAM) in Mexico."

This study hopes to establish a new paradigm of Coulter counting using electrohydrodynamic (EHD) cone-jets, and demonstrate the potential of this technique in quantifying and deploying nanoscale objects ranging from biological macromolecules to synthetic nanoparticles. Resistive nanopore sensing is a miniaturized descendent of Coulter counting using biological or synthetic nanopores. Contemporary nanopore sensors typically have fixed diameters and suffer from either short life spans or low reproducibility. These limitations can be circumvented by exploiting the EHD cone-jet transition, a unique phenomenon that permits production of tunable nanoscale liquid jets from much larger nozzles off-the-shelf. To this end, experimental and analytical tools will be combined to identify conditions required for reproducible EHD jets at both micron and sub-micron levels. By integrating Coulter counting with EHD cone-jets, a drop-and-place technique for deploying nano-objects will be developed with unprecedented single-particle accuracy. This study will address the following fundamental questions associated with the development of the EHD Coulter counting technique: Can nanoscale EHD jets, with or without intrinsic pulsations, be reproducibly generated and detected? Can a liquid jet be used in lieu of a synthetic pore to accomplish Coulter counting? Can single-particle accuracy be achieved in EHD deployment? The interrelated experimental and analytical investigations outlined in the study will reveal scaling laws governing the dynamics and stability of nanoscale EHD jets, and establish the performance boundary of the new technique of EHD Coulter counting. The successful development of an EHD Coulter counter would enable the analysis of nanoparticles such as drug capsules and quantum dots over a tunable range of length scale without resorting to labeling, and the deployment of macromolecules with single-molecule accuracy for protein nanoarrays and in vitro compartmentalization. Based on this research, the PI will develop a new graduate-level course in Microscale Physicochemical Hydrodynamics and will train undergraduate researchers through the Pratt Fellows and NSF REU programs at Duke University. The PI will recruit a teacher for two summer internships from the Southern School of Engineering, a high school that offers a pre-engineering program with a predominant African American enrollment. This teacher will participate in building prototype EHD Coulter counters and in training university students to communicate scientific ideas at the high school level and then, assisted by the PI, transfer the knowledge in state-of-the-art microfluidics research into a high school level curricular unit that supports the North Carolina Standard Course of Study."

In order to achieve our primary objective in Phase II, PHB proposes to produce a new highly-sensitive and stable MIMS system prototype for clinical use. We will develop a prototype disposable, reliable, easy to use biochip cassette with limited potential for biohazard exposure. To reduce the need for off-chip processing, PHB will implement a cartridge- based fluidic channel to remove blood cells. We will develop specific attachment strategies for antibodies and/or F(ab)2 fragments of antibodies that enable the efficient capture of antigens to be used as targets for autoantibodies. This will eventually lead to the development of reverse capture arrays for identification of autoantigens against which autoAb expression may be used to differentiate between normal and disease states. We will optimize the protein printing methodology, and blocking protocols to enable the optical interference detection system to provide reproducible results in molecular binding reactions on a multiplicity of nanostructured protein chips. We will evaluate the performance of the optimized substrate and platform in real-time with a representative set of antibody targets. Our initial focus will be a panel consisting of Thyroperoxidase antibody, TSH receptor antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies. These tests can potentially be used to diagnose an autoimmune thyroid disease and to separate it from other forms of thyroiditis.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are to develop the Molecular Interaction Measurement System (MIMS) which has the potential to measure multiple analyte types (protein, RNA, DNA etc.) in real-time. MIMS uses optical interference to measure the changes in thickness, resulting from binding of a ligand to a macromolecule attached to the surface of a detector chip. The array format of the MIMS assay permits simultaneous detection of the binding of multiple analytes. One application of interest and immediate clinical value is in the detection of autoantibodies which target host tissue and mediate autoimmune diseases. MIMS can enable specific detection without having to tag (e.g. with radioisotope or fluorescence) a patients sample: resulting in more accurate and cost effective diagnoses In addition, the finding that patients with cancer produce autoantibodies against antigens in their tumors suggests that such autoantibodies could have both diagnostic and prognostic value. Commercially, MIMS can be a tool to easily, rapidly and cost effectively screen a large number of patients with different types and stages of cancer and other diseases providing value to clinicians, to patients and the clinical research community."

However, the age of terrace gravels is usually difficult to determine in the absence of datable volcanic rocks. One method that has been used to date terrace gravels is cosmogenic nuclide burial dating, in which the rare nuclides aluminum-26 and beryllium-10 are measured in the mineral quartz by accelerator mass spectrometry. These two nuclides are produced by cosmic rays that originate in space and travel through the atmosphere, but are blocked as they travel through rock. If quartz grains are first exposed to cosmic rays near the ground surface, but are then buried within a deposit that is at least 10 meters deep, then the gradual radioactive decay of aluminum-26 and beryllium-10 offers a means to date deposition over the past 3-5 million years. HOwever, this technique requires great burial depths in order to minimize post-burial production by deeply penetrating cosmic rays. This project introduces and tests a new method that circumvents the problem of post-burial production by analyzing several individual pebbles from a shallower depth. Each pebble will have exactly the same post-burial production. This allows the use of an isochron method, in which a plot of aluminum-26 versus beryllium-10 concentrations yields a line whose slope depends on age. This study will test the isochron burial dating method at sites of known age, and by analyzing samples in stratigraphic sequence. The dating method will then be applied to a terrace sequence on the Sundays River in southern Africa, to determine uplift rates over the past 3 million years. Uplift rates in southern Africa remain very poorly constrained, and can provide important information on the interactions between erosion and uplift, as well as the role of Earth's mantle in supporting African topography. <br/><br/>The development of a new dating method for gravels over the past 5 million years will open opportunities for determining erosion and uplift rates, and can be used for dating gravel deposits that contain stone tools or fossils. Results of the field investigations in souther Africa will help show when the climate became drier, and how rivers responded by changing their load or their incision rate. The results will also provide, for the first time, a dated record of river incision and tectonic uplift on the southern coast of South Africa, where rates and patterns of uplift have been debated for over 50 years. This work will also provide dates for terrace gravels that contain important assemblages of stone tools, and will provide a timescale for technological developments in the Earlier Stone Age. It is anticipated that the isochron method of cosmogenic nuclide burial dating developed in this study will receive wide applications in many fields studying earth and human history over the past 5 million years."

Past researchers have found that dust and fog deposition depend on canopy density (leaf area). Canopy traps phosphorus enabling a positive feedback between vegetation and phosphorus deposition. This study is investigating the ecohydrological mechanism controlling the occurrence and strength of these feedbacks and their susceptibility to changes in climate and land cover. The principle objectives are:<br/>1. To quantify the total phosphorus input from deposition to a dry neotropical forest and to investigate its fluctuations between dry and wet seasons, associated with fires, and proximity to ?slash and burn? management.<br/>2. To quantify the dependence of phosphorus deposition on canopy properties and thus the strength of the canopy-phosphorus deposition feedback.<br/>3.

However, the impacts of the MJO on the chemical component of the climate system are not understood nor even well documented. This project studies the MJO's impacts on atmospheric ozone and aerosols, two important atmospheric constituents. First, the investigators will utilize a rich set of atmospheric ozone and aerosol data from a number of satellite sensors and in-situ observations to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of intraseasonal variability of atmospheric ozone and aerosols as well as the dynamical and hydrological (e.g., rainfall, winds, and water vapor) patterns associated with these variations. Second, they will compare the intraseasonal variations of atmospheric ozone and aerosols between satellite/in-situ observations and chemistry/transport model (CTM) (e.g., Community Atmosphere Model with chemistry) simulations in order to quantify the fidelity of the CTM's representation of intraseasonal variability of atmospheric ozone and aerosols. Where possible, they will use the model and observations together to more fully understand the dynamical and chemical processes behind the intraseasonal variations of atmospheric ozone and aerosols. <br/><br/>This project will lead to better documentation and understanding of the intraseasonal variations of atmospheric ozone and aerosols and their connection to the MJO in both observations and models.

The GOAL system is automated and available to students through any internet connection at any time of day. Students proceed through their chosen material at their own pace and have the freedom to choose specific subtopics and also to pursue specific topics with different degrees of depth. The GOAL system presents in each topic in multiple modalities so that students can choose a presentation that matches their preferred learning style. The system also includes a variety of tools that enable students to assess their mastery of a given topic with real-time feedback. Over time, the system learns the individual student's preferences and presents material accordingly. The assessment tools also enable the system to accumulate data over time that can be used to measure the effectiveness of specific learning materials. The initial implementation of the GOAL system is in a digital logic design course. Digital logic design is a course common to most undergraduate electrical engineering curricula. The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an independent evaluator."

Despite its fundamental importance, little is known about how plants sense and adapt to darkness in the daily light-dark cycle or to unpredictable environmental stresses that compromise photosynthesis and respiration and deplete energy supplies. Recent studies have discovered that the evolutionarily conserved Arabidopsis protein kinases, KIN10 and KIN11, control convergent reprogramming of transcription in response to seemingly unrelated darkness, sugar and stress conditions. The project aims to build a new conceptual framework of energy signaling in plants by uncovering the diverse physiological and developmental functions, signaling links, and regulatory mechanisms of the conserved energy sensors. Inducible mutant transgenic lines will be use to gain new insight into the roles of energy signaling in plant response and adaptation to diverse environmental challenges, and in plant growth and development. Integrative cellular, biochemical, genetic and genomic approaches will be applied to enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of energy signaling from the control of sensor activity, stability, localization, partner interactions to its downstream transcription factors and primary target genes. This project represents a new line of research that integrates diverse plant responses and regulation into convergent energy signaling vital to plant growth and survival. The studies on the regulatory mechanisms of energy signaling are urgently important in light of the rising global needs in the development of renewable biofuels. The basic research will enable targeted genetic modification of carbon allocation, growth and development, architecture, and stress and pathogen resistance, all major determinants of crop yield and renewable energy production. The project will provide unique training opportunities for students and postdocs in multidisciplinary and integrative research, and promote woman and minority scientists as future research leaders.

We plan to explore the manner in which liquid-vapor systems behave in confined geometries with typical scales of 0.1 - 20 microns where the role of the transitional zone between the bulk meniscus and the adsorbed liquid film becomes dominant. Of particular interest will be the description of the role of the thin liquid transition film that leads the bulk liquid phase and has been demonstrated to contribute significantly to the overall heat and mass transfer in small systems. The effects of fluid and surface chemistry, geometry, and the presence of fluid additives will be systematically explored. Novel experimental techniques will be used to measure velocities and temperatures in the 200 nm near the liquid-solid interface, as well as to directly measure the thickness of the thin liquid film on the solid substrate as it evolves. Measurements of fluid velocities and evaporation rates will be taken and compared with theoretical and numerical predictions for similar systems.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The behavior of two-phase systems in microgeometries, and in particular, the character of the thin liquid film on a smooth surface continues to be a problem of critical importance and one in which there is active debate in the heat transfer and fluid mechanics literature. As microengineering continues to push towards smaller scales, the characterization and modeling of the physics of these thermal transport problems becomes more relevant and challenging. High-quality experimental data are critical in providing guidance to models and numerical experiments in this field. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The results obtained during this research will help guide design and analysis for a wealth of micron-scale heat transfer systems (heat pipes, capillary pumped loops, etc.) that can be used in a multitude of applications such as chip cooling, thermal control in micro-systems, space power applications, etc. The project will support the training of one graduate student to work closely with the PI. The project will also involve an undergraduate student. We will also continue to build on our successful history of recruiting under-represented groups (through the Leadership Alliance), and will leverage and participate with the Brown University MRSEC outreach program, for example by working with the K-12 Teacher Training Program and high school student Research Experience Program. Lastly, we will continue to work with media producers (such as NOVA and Discovery Channel) in the development of science programming for a wide audience."

When these associations are established, both partners undergo significant developmental changes as they accommodate to the symbiotic state. Microbial symbionts often induce alterations both in the host cells they directly contact, as well as in more remote cells and tissues. Often these changes involve toxic oxygen species such as nitric oxide (NO) that the host produces in response to bacteria. Similarly, motile bacteria often lose locomotory structures (flagella) upon host colonization. The squid Euprymna scolopes forms its light organ in response to colonization by the luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri. This project will focus on the roles of symbiont flagellation and host NO production. as both developmental phenotypes, and potential signaling molecules between the partners in this process. Two questions are addressed: 1) Does the environment of the developing light organ regulate synthesis of the flagellar apparatus? In turn, are flagellins, the principal proteins of the flagella, involved in the induction of the organ? 2) How do the bacteria reduce the host's defensive NO production and how does NO-binding by the symbionts give them a competitive advantage in the symbiosis? The proposed research will develop and apply a variety of techniques using molecular biology, molecular genetics and microscopy. This research promises to reveal some of the very basic ""language"" underlying the interactions of host cells with their bacterial partners. As all animals are now believed to have persistent interactions with essential microbes, the work should provide insight into very basic mechanisms of the biology of animals.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>As researchers in the frontier field of beneficial animal-microbe interactions, the PIs view it as their responsibility to educate both the public and the community of biologists about this critical area of the biological world. To accomplish this goal, the PIs participate in educational-outreach efforts through U Wisconsin that facilitate training of students from high school through postdoctoral, as well as educating the public. These efforts include UW's Wisconsin Alliance for Minority Participation, a principal goal of which is to recruit underrepresented minorities into graduate labs at UW. In addition, the PIs' labs participate in the UW Outreach Club and PLATO (learning opportunities for seniors). The PI's and their labs disseminate information about the impact of symbiotic associations on animal biology both through interviews with the media and in the creation and maintenance of 5 public websites."

The classic approach of using 16S rRNA gene sequences to detect and analyze bacterial communities in environmental samples without isolation and cultivation is not possible when studying denitrifying bacteria, because they are phylogenetically diverse. This is a major issue, given the importance of denitrification in water and wastewater pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and ozone layer destruction. This proposal is to develop and to optimize a novel molecular technique to determine the phylogenetic identity of functionally active nitrate-, nitrite-, nitric oxide-, and nitrous oxide-reducers in activated sludge and soil. Specific objectives are: (1) to optimize the Sequential mRNA FISH Flow Cytometry (SmRFF) method (developed previously in our lab) and investigate its potential for other microbial processes; (2) to determine the effect of floc structure, DO and carbon and nitrogen levels on the active denitrifying community; (3) to identify ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) that denitrify; and (4) to examine the denitrifying ecology of a bioreactor that uses denitrifying AOB for treating high ammonia, low COD wastewater. <br/><br/>The Sequential mRNA FISH-Flow Cytometry (SmRFF) method holds tremendous promise and may lead to significant results, as well as open new areas of research. This proposed project will be among the first studies to perform the following: (1) separate cells that are actively expressing the nitrate-, nitrite-, nitric oxide-, and nitrous oxide ?reducing genes; (2) capture nearly full-length 16S rRNA genes of active denitrifiers; and (3) apply combinatorial flow cytometry to identify AOB that are expressing the nirS and nirK genes. Determining the minimum level of mRNA copies needed for mRNA FISH will allow the more general application of SmRFF to other microbial ecology areas, such as bioremediation. The proposed research if successful would be a potentially significant methodological advance that would impact general microbial ecology as well as biological processes in environmental engineering.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the multidisciplinary education in the areas of microbiology, molecular biology and engineering. The PI has mentored 24 REU students in the last 7 years, and will continue to expose undergraduates to research and the excitement of discovery. This project will also potentially benefit municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants that perform nitrogen removal. In addition, results from this project will be incorporated in summer workshops for high school students, and microbiology workshops for wastewater treatment professionals that are regularly organized by the PI."

Global environmental change is exacerbating freshwater limitation by negatively affecting not only water quantity but quality as well, through stimulating harmful algal blooms (HABs) in waterbodies across the globe. This project aims to understand and predict how and when communities of microscopic algae in lakes shift towards dominance by the toxic algae (cyanobacteria in particular) responsible for most HABs in freshwaters. Using lake sampling in Michigan and mathematical models, Litchman will explore how global warming alters lake water movement and thus conditions such as light and temperature that affect algae growth, including toxic cyanobacteria. Because many HABs can increase the availability of nitrogen in the water, the project will also investigate how changing nutrient availability affects interactions among algal groups. Finally, Litchman will explore how rapid evolutionary response of harmful cyanobacteria to changing climate shapes community composition of microscopic algae and impacts water quality. During this award, Litchman will teach a new course on Field Aquatic Ecology at Michigan State University for advanced undergraduate and graduate students focusing on the effects of global environmental change on aquatic ecosystems. Teachers from local rural schools will work with the PI to develop age-appropriate learning activities on aquatic ecology, water quality issues and global change. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the project as will local lake residents and lake associations who will aid in sampling efforts to detect HAB-forming species. Litchman will collaborate with European colleagues on adapting lake physics models to predict HAB occurrences in the future."

While finite permutation groups have long been examined, the current project uses model-theoretic methods to extend this mathematical theory to several classes of infinite permutation groups with finitary properties. In particular, the project focuses on the strong model-theoretic properties of finite Morley rank (fMR) and countable categoricity. In the case of finite groups, many insights about permutation groups occurred toward the end of the classification program for finite simple groups. In the infinite case, model theorists have pursued an analogous classification program for simple groups of finite Morley rank for nearly thirty years. The current status of the classification prompted two prominent researchers, Alexandre Borovik and Gregory Cherlin, to signal in 2007 that significant progress on infinite permutation groups of finite Morley rank is imminent. The proposed project has begun by addressing one of Borovik and Cherlin?s questions concerning the fundamental model theoretic interactions between the permutation group and the set upon which it acts, equipped with a relational ?footprint? of the group action. The investigation proceeds in the fMR case toward analysis of primitive permutation groups, generic n-transitivity, and other related problems. In parallel, the project considers these same problems, but with countable categoricity in place of finite Morley rank. Whereas groups of fMR generally resemble algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields, countably categorical groups tend toward infinite-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields. Taken together, groups with the properties of finite Morley rank or countable categoricity encompass many familiar examples of infinite permutation groups which appear across mathematics. Advances in the fMR or countably categorical settings can be expected to have broad applicability within model theory and other fields such as number theory, algebraic graph theory and abstract geometry. <br/><br/>The project features international cooperation, with involvement from researchers from the USA, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and elsewhere, and the results would have rapid and wide circulation. Furthermore, implications of this research could easily reach beyond mathematics, since permutation groups are used in the applied study of symmetries of many objects, from crystals to the arithmetic curves that underlie much of modern cryptography. Due to their size, some of these objects are effectively ?infinite?. For example, the world-wide-web, when considered as a set of points (webpages) connected by lines (hyperlinks), forms a nearly impossible system for full-scale analysis. While computationally infinite, such objects are naturally finite. In this case, it may be fruitful to analyze their symmetries using infinite permutation groups with finitary properties, such as the ones featured in this research."

Recent studies have suggested that nitrogen reservoirs in the vadose zone have been potentially underestimated by 3% to 16% globally and 14% to 71% in warm deserts. It has also been conjectured that the accumulation of nitrate in the desert subsoil is the result of infrequent deep-wetting events, and it has been suggested that there is a positive correlation between the amount of nitrate found in the subsoil and the age of the desert. In regard to unusual nitrate deposits found in desert soils, of particular interest is the Atacama Desert in Chile. The origins of the highly concentrated nitrate deposits have been the subject of much debate. This desert is one of the driest environments on earth with an average annual rainfall of 1 to 2 mm per year and it is estimated that it has been this dry for 10 to 15 million years. For this reason it is often used as a model for the environment of Mars. Ongoing desiccation of the nitrate deposits in the area have caused both small and large desiccation polygons to form via shrinking of the porous formation. Over time the fractures left by the large desiccation polygons have become filled with saline-cemented sand, silt and rock debris forming nitrate rich sand dykes.<br/>While several models exist that address the constitutive modeling of both saturated and unsaturated soils undergoing large inelastic deformations, the mathematical tools available either cannot account for the two time scales that result from the fracturing of soils during desiccation, or do not include the evolving scales necessary to model long-term chemical transport. <br/>We will develop a generalized mathematical model to describe flow and transport in saturated/unsaturated cracking soils. In particular, we will use a hybrid mixture theoretic (HMT) approach to model flow and block-transport mechanisms, predict crack formation, and obtain a dynamic description of the hydraulic and transport properties of soils undergoing desiccation. The HMT approach to this problem will improve over previous approaches for elasto-plastic behavior of multi-phase systems, by relaxing some of the restrictive assumptions, such as the use of the standard Darcy?s law to describe flow in the water phase, and identification of appropriate independent variables that permit development of rigorous and meaningful yield functions for analyzing plasticity. This includes modeling the dual time-scale problem where elastic sediment fills the void space of cracks created during the drying process, and the non-local transport through the fractal fracture paths that often result. For the latter part, we will model constituent velocity in fractal fractures using subordinated stochastic ordinary differential equations; upscaling will be accomplished with generalized central limit theorems. Should time and man-power be available, we will apply the theoretical findings to the nitrogen deposits in the Atacama Desert in Chile."

The research goal is to characterize the effect of a passively imposed asymmetric force on a bubble during the boiling process. Such asymmetry is created by the use of a surface with repeated ratchet structures and pyramidal reentrant cavities located on one of its sides. The hypothesis is that with several ratchets, this local asymmetric motion can be translated to a net fluid pumping. Educational activities aim to provide a synergy between research and education, as well as between several universities.<br/>The main objectives of the project are to: (1) Determine, using a suite of non-intrusive imaging methods, time-varying bubble diameters and frequencies, liquid and bubble velocities, and temporally- and spatially- resolved surface temperatures, (2) Refine preliminary models based on information obtained from the above imaging experiments, (3) Validate the model against global measurements of a large-array of ratchets, for which boiling curves will be established, and (4) Integrate research findings into a new module in an existing multi-University Electronics Thermal Management course.<br/>Intellectual Merit: The enhancement technique can be applied to heat transfer from adversely oriented surfaces and in space thermal management. The proposed methods of experimentation present a detailed estimation of flow and temperature field in boiling flows that will be useful to modellers. The proposed analyses will highlight forces of importance by performing experiments under different orientations and subcooling levels, and with two fluids of contrasting properties. Passive methods of heat transfer enhancement are important in a broader context of energy efficiency.<br/>Broader Impact: Educational activities will include integration of the project results in the form of a module into an existing, past-NSF funded Electronics Thermal Management live-internet multi-campus course and will incorporate Oregon State University as a new partner. At the end of year 2, a DC-9 microgravity flight experiment is planned as a part of a concurrent grant from NASA. Several senior undergraduate students will take part in the design and eventual testing of this experiment. An AT&T-Minority-Engineering-Program student at Auburn University will also be working closely with OSU undergraduate students.

The educational research objectives are to develop and disseminate learning modules and materials on program verification and to integrate formal program verification - reasoning based on mathematics - into the undergraduate computer science and engineering curriculum.<br/><br/>The mathematics to achieve this project's educational goals of integrating program verification into the undergraduate curriculum is through the use of sets and functions. An annotation notation incorporating recent advances in specification languages is developed to document programs as functions from input values to output values. The annotation notation supports a spectrum of formality, from informal to fully mathematical, to assist an incremental integration into the curriculum. A functional verification approach, which supports a natural, intuitive, forward reasoning, is extended for modular verification of object-oriented programs, and lightweight tools are developed for teaching and learning functional specification and verification. An incremental integration to the curriculum is achieved by first delivering an experimental course on program verification and then, using this experience as a guide, introducing problem-based learning modules throughout undergraduate courses.

There is clear evidence that such traits are important to individual survival and reproduction, but there is a lack of a general understanding of how selection on performance, and indirectly it's underlying physiology (including hormones), affects the phenotype via the wide-ranging effects of hormones. One key aspect of the symposium at the 2009 Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) meeting in Boston, MA will be to highlight the diverse ways in which hormones may affect various performance traits across a range of animal species. This symposium will encourage a synthetic approach by bringing together, for the first time, an international group of researchers working on hormones and performance in both vertebrates and invertebrates. These researchers span a wide range of career stages and geographic locations that do not normally have the opportunity to interact directly. Nearly one-half of the symposium presenters are from outside the USA, and several of the participants do not regularly attend SICB meetings. One benefit of this symposium is that it will provide an excellent opportunity for students and junior researchers to exchange ideas with more established investigators. This will be accomplished through direct interaction during the symposium, planned social events involving symposium participants and students, and a complementary contributed paper session. Participation by historically underrepresented groups, with nearly one-third of participants being women or minorities, is also being accomplished. Publication of the symposium's proceedings in SICB's journal, Integrative and Comparative Biology, will ensure that the intellectual products of the symposium are broadly disseminated."

In all languages, pitch (as one aspect of speech prosody) can express attitude or emotion. In some languages, like English, pitch patterns, usually called intonation contours, also express distinctions such as that between a question and a statement. In languages like Mandarin Chinese, on the other hand, pitch patterns called tones go still further to signal differences between words that are otherwise identical. Despite significant advances in recent decades, a unified theoretical account of the linguistic phenomena called tone and intonation remains elusive in crucial respects. In fact, there is still no universal agreement even over how best to characterize the formal properties of intonation contours in languages like English. What seems to be missing is a common acoustic or articulatory vocabulary for the expression of the relevant distinctions, a single measurable dimension within which contours can be reliably distinguished regardless of the language under investigation. This project develops a new mathematical approach, based on the notion of Tonal Center of Gravity, to characterizing pitch distinctions in English. This approach reconciles seemingly contradictory results from the experimental literature on the perception of contrasting pitch contours. Our research will concentrate on a small number of intonation contours from English, and will test the applicability of our model in two kinds of experiments. The first involves automatic classification of pitch contours recorded from native speakers in an experimental setting. The second involves direct manipulation through speech synthesis of a number of the physical characteristics of pitch contours that might be involved in conveying speakers' intentions, to see which variables have the greatest effect on listeners' judgments of utterance meaning.<br/><br/>The project lays the groundwork for a unified approach to the production and perception of tonal contrasts in human language, one that expresses how systems differ, while capturing the deeper commonality among languages at the same time. The results of this work will also have a broader impact in the area of speech technology. For example, identifying the perceptually relevant characteristics of distinct intonation patterns will allow for greater realism in speech synthesis systems. In addition, being able to distinguish automatically between similar but perceptually distinct contours will allow automatic pronunciation training systems to give more helpful feedback to second language learners. Finally, this new model will facilitate automatic categorization of intonation contours for speech understanding systems. Progress in this area will ultimately allow such systems to derive meaning not just from the sequence of words in an utterance, but from the subtle meaning differences conveyed by intonation as well."

These signals allow animals to assess their environment and to find food, potential mates, and escape from predators. Understanding how animals recognize and respond to these chemical cues is essential for a better understanding of animal development and behavior. We are studying animal-to-animal communication in a laboratory animal, the roundworm C. elegans. C. elegans emits a complex mixture of chemicals that acts as a crowding signal for other worms. The goal of this project is to explore how C. elegans detects and responds to this crowding signal. Specifically, the goal is to identify the nerve cells and the proteins present in them (receptors) that detect these chemicals, and to investigate how detection of this information alters the development and behavior of these animals. Understanding this critical process will provide key information on chemical communication among animals, as well as between animals and their environment. This project will provide the basis for a doctoral thesis and one to two undergraduate senior honors research theses. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the experimental and theoretical basis of genetics, behavioral studies, genomics and molecular biology, and will be provided the opportunity to present their work at local and national forums. This work will also foster interactions between biologists, physicists and biological chemists."

A life settlement is a financial transaction in which a life insurance policyholder sells the policy to a third party (a life settlement firm) for more than the cash surrender value offered by the life insurance company, thereby the third-party purchaser assumes responsibility for all subsequent premium payments to the life insurance company and becomes the new beneficiary of the life insurance policy at maturation (i.e., the time of the original policyholder's death).<br/><br/>The life settlement industry results from two key features of the primary life insurance market. The first feature is that the premium for life insurance is typically front-loaded in the sense that the premium exceeds the actuarially fair premium in early years, while it is lower than the actuarially fair premium in latter years especially when the policyholder has impaired health. The second feature is that the cash surrender value (CSV) for life insurance contracts is either zero for Term insurance, or at a level that is low and does not depend on the health status of the policyholder. Because the present actuarial value of a life insurance policy is much higher for individuals with impaired health, the fact that the CSV does not respond to the health status provides an opening for the gains of trade between policyholders with impaired health and the life settlement companies.<br/><br/>The emerging secondary market for life insurance has triggered controversies between life insurance companies and the life settlement industry. Life insurers are opposed to life settlements. Given the importance of<br/>life insurance market in the economy, it is important to rigorously study, both theoretically and empirically, how the emerging life settlement may affect the primary life insurance market. <br/><br/>This research has two goals. First, the researcher is using economic theory to analyze the effect of the secondary market for life insurance on primary market insurance contracts and on consumer welfare. Second, he conducts empirical tests of the theoretical predictions about how the primary life insurance market may respond to the threat from the settlement industry. Finally, he uses the results of these tests to ultimately calibrate the models and quantify the welfare effects of the life settlement industry. In particular, to the extent that the answer to the first question, particularly the consumer welfare question, depends on why policyholders lapse, i.e., whether it is due to loss of bequest motives or due to liquidity shocks, he also examines why policyholders lapse.<br/><br/>The research project will provide the intellectual knowledge for more informed government regulation regarding the life settlement industry. Because life insurance is one special type of dynamic contracts, the research can also potentially shed light on the secondary market involving dynamic contracts in general."

It is a study of engineering and urbanization in Rome that focuses on the period 1557 to 1590 during which the physical city of Rome was transformed by numerous engineering projects: the widening and straightening of streets, the reconstruction of two ancient aqueducts, the construction of numerous fountains, the erection of obelisks at key points in the city, the construction of sewers, the building and renovation of numerous palaces and churches, and major efforts to control the flooding of the Tiber River. Maps and other images of Rome also proliferated as the city was surveyed and renovated to better reflect the power and authority of the papacy and the Church.<br/><br/>The period of the focus of this project is well before the emergence of professional engineering. Engineer/architects, magistrates, learned antiquarians, cardinals, and others participated in discussions and wrote many proposals and tracts concerning various projects and solutions to engineering problems. Because the city was governed by two entities, the papacy and the communal government, much archival documentations also exists concerning their communication and conflicts over engineering projects. The 30 year focus does not signal a narrow local study, but rather enables a full archival investigation of the rich documentation available. This makes possible a study of the processes of engineering, its various discussions and solutions, failures as well as successes, the use of labor on work sites, the varied fates of engineers (ranging from imprisonment to high honors), and the deep relationships of engineering in Rome at this time with antiquarian and humanist learning.<br/><br/>This in-depth study of Roman engineering in the late Renaissance has implications for two major areas of general interest. First, it will be of interest to historians of engineering as well as to those concerned with urbanization and the relationships of physical cities and their infrastructures to cultural mores and political power. These topics concern both early modern historians and many others focused on modern urbanization and political culture. Second, this study concerns the culture of knowledge and its implications for the Scientific Revolution. An important focus among historians of science has been the relationship of artisanal and technical practice to learned cultures in the development of the ?new sciences,? which emphasized experiment, observation, and empirical values. This study investigates the numerous relationships of learned men and practitioners within engineering projects in Rome. Such an investigation in the generation before Galileo will contribute a new vantage point to an ongoing discussion."

One of the greatest contrasts between the biological organisms and human technology lies in how they are constructed. Plants and animals grow from the inside out, often from a single cell to an organism containing billions of cells, each of which is built from molecular components that are manufactured with atomic precision within the cell. In contrast, mankind's greatest engineering marvels, such as airplanes and skyscrapers and computers, are put together from the outside in, with components being manufactured in factories and assembled piece by piece. This distinction is often referred to as ""bottom-up"" vs ""top-down"" assembly in the biological ""bottom-up"" approach, the assembly process is guided by the components themselves, while in the engineering ""top-down"" approach, there is an entity conceptually above the object being built that supervises and guides the manufacturing process. Human engineering has mastered top-down methods to create systems of great complexity (but has not extended them to the atomic and molecular scale) and has exploited bottom-up methods for the synthesis of diverse molecular, polymeric and crystalline structures (but has not created information-rich structures of great complexity). <br/>Project Goals. Our goal is to demonstrate how bottom-up techniques can create complex atomically-defined structures, as biology does, by embedding information and computational processes within the molecules themselves. In biological development, a program (the genome) uses biochemistry to guide the growth process and determine the ultimate form of the organism. In the parlance of computer science, a system that can be programmed to accomplish any task that can be accomplished is called a ""universal"" system. A universal computer can be programmed to perform any computation, while a universal constructor can be programmed to carry out any construction task. Recent work has theoretically shown that universal molecular self-assembly is possible and has experimentally demonstrated that the approach shows promise, using DNA as a construction material to create functional molecular devices so-called ""DNA nanotechnology"". In this proposal, we aim to bring DNA nanotechnology to the point where universal bottom-up self-assembly can be achieved well enough that immediate technological applications can be demonstrated. <br/>Specific Aims. We aim to make major advances both in our ability to program complex self-assembly logic and in our ability to interface the DNA structures to chemically-, optically-, and electronically-relevant materials. We will focus on four main goals, which span the range from long-term fundamental work to near-term development: (1) self-assembly of a template for a complex molecular-scale electronic circuit; (2) programming the behavior of molecular walking motors to transport components in nanofabrication tasks; (3) attaching carbon nanotube wires to create small nanoscale electronic circuits; and (4) integrating bottom-up and top-down fabrication by placing and orienting self-assembled components at target locations on silicon wafers with functional electrical contacts. <br/>Uniquely, the aims of this research require simultaneously development of two novel computing systems: the first, inspired by biological self-assembly and development, operates at the level of molecular machines and biochemistry, and will be programmed to construct the second, composed of carbon nanotubes assembled into nanoscale circuits, which operates at the electrical level like conventional computing devices.<br/>Broader Impact. An important aspect of this project will be the training of young scientists (undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs) capable of spanning the interdisciplinary subjects involved in this work."

The result will be timely and accurate assessment of land cover change in areas that typically experience constant cloud cover and therefore make traditional methods of remote sensing impossible. <br/><br/>Professors Moran and Lu from Indiana University, along with international collaborators at the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) contend that the multiple polarizations of ALOS/PALSAR and RADARSAT2, fused with analysis of optical data, will provide better and timelier vegetation classification accuracy, and will improve the temporal and spatial analysis of land use and land cover in areas characterized by persistent cloud cover. Two study areas will be the focus of this study, Altamira and Santarem, both in the Brazilian Amazon state of Para. This will enable the analysis of data collected for several years by this research team using a nested-georeferenced approach including soil analyses, vegetation stand structure and composition, land use histories, institutional analyses, demography and decision-making of hundreds of households, and land cover classification using multi-temporal remote sensing data since the 1970s (MSS, TM/ETM+, and IKONOS/QuickBird,) thereby reducing costs and to achieve results much more quickly. <br/><br/>The PIs have obtained recent images of RADARSAT2 and ALOS/PALSAR for both study areas, as well as IKONOS and Quickbird images. These data will be fused with archived data for the study areas from Landsat MSS, TM and ETM+ (and ASTER) to advance the state of knowledge and methods in land cover assessment applicable across any part of the world where cloud-cover constrains seasonal observations of changes in land cover. Separatibility analysis will be used to examine the capability of the data fused images, which are developed with different data fusion techniques, in distinguishing the land cover classes of interest based on the training sample plots from extensive field work and the intensive use of the IKONOS and Quickbird very high resolution data. The results of this study will solve a major obstacle currently faced by scientists in quantifying land cover change in areas with persistent cloud cover. Much of the humid tropical world is covered by clouds for most of the year, and it can be sometimes years between dates when it is possible to obtain cloud-free images for monitoring changing forest conditions. This prevents timely responses to deforestation events and understanding of land cover changes over time. This project addresses an urgent need for timely analysis of land cover changes in the Brazilian Amazon, and in humid tropical regions more broadly."

The intellectual merit of the project is that these will likely be the only chemical measurements on the brittle ice zone and, therefore, will bridge the gap in the expected continuous records of climate, ice sheet dynamics and biological evolution based on chemical measurements. High resolution sampling and analysis, probably on selected portions and depth intervals in the brittle ice zone, will help with the independent, high-precision dating of the WAIS Divide core and contribute to the achievement of the major objectives of the WAIS Divide project?development of high resolution climate records with which to investigate issues of climate forcing by greenhouse gases and the role of Antarctica and Southern Hemisphere in the global climate system. Planned collaboration with other WAIS Divide investigators will develop the longest and most detailed volcanic record from Antarctica ice cores. The broader impacts of this project include a contribution to enhancing our knowledge of the climate system. Such improvements in understanding of the global climate system and the ability to predict the magnitude and uncertainty of future changes are highly relevant to the global community. The project will support post-doctoral scientists and graduate students, including those from under-represented groups, will contribute to education, an help to train future scientists and promote diversity in research and education.

The students' research experience will be enhanced by a variety of educational activities. They will attend a weekly workshop that will be focused on how to design experiments, how to structure logical oral presentations and written reports as well as how to successfully prepare for graduate school admissions. Journal articles relevant to the field of biological diagnostics will also be presented at this weekly meeting. Each participant will be required to read and present one journal article over the course of the 10-week program. The REU site program will culminate with a final Poster Symposium at which each participant will present a poster that summarizes his or her summer research project.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of this REU program is the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) component. During this program 2 San Francisco Bay Area high school teachers will spend 1-week in the BioChip laboratory at the BNC learning a high-school appropriate microfluidics lab exercise. At the end of the program each high school teacher will receive a stipend and support for supplies to run the microfluidics lab exercise with their students at the high schools.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator (PI) will focus recruitment efforts towards students from members of underrepresented minorities and students from schools where research opportunities are limited. The goal is to have 75% of the participants come from underrepresented groups and 50% of the participants be women. Also, by including the RET component to teach high school teachers a microfluidics lab exercise, the PI hopes to reach a diverse pool of high school students who otherwise might not have considered careers in science or engineering."

The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.<br/><br/>This award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Robert M. Pringle to work with Dr. Fabian Haas at the International Centre for Insect Pathology and Ecology (CIPE), with Dr. Charles Warui at the National Museums of Kenya, and with Dr. M. Kinnaird at the Mpala Research in Kenya.<br/><br/>Recent studies suggest that large mammalian herbivores may be ?strong interactors? whose removal will precipitate major changes in biological communities. This project aims to document and explain the short-term (2-3 year) responses of plant and invertebrate communities to the exclusion of ungulate herbivores in a Kenyan savanna, and also to examine how these responses are contingent upon variability in rainfall. This is being done using a unique experiment with four 1-ha treatments: total exclusion (removal of all herbivores larger than 4-kg hares), exclusion of all herbivores larger than 6-kg dik-diks, exclusion only of megaherbivores (elephants and giraffes), and unfenced control (all animals present). These treatments are each replicated three times at three levels of a natural rainfall gradient. Project personnel are testing four specific hypotheses. I: Herbivore exclusion alters the palatability of individual plants, enhances recruitment, reduces species evenness, and increases structural complexity at the habitat level. II: Via these effects on plants, herbivore exclusion leads to increased total biomass of both herbivorous and carnivorous arthropods. III: Indirect responses of individual arthropod species vary, but depend on (a) diet breadth and host-plant preference, (b) foraging strategy, and (c) predation vulnerability. IV: The strength of both direct and indirect effects is negatively correlated with rainfall. <br/>Humans are reducing large-herbivore populations worldwide, and climate change promises dramatic changes in precipitation patterns. Yet nobody knows how these changes will affect biodiversity and ecological function in iconic landscapes such as African savannas and the Yellowstone ecosystem. Generating this knowledge will reveal fundamental truths about how large mammals influence ecological dynamics and how these influences are modulated by environmental context. It will also provide a basis for predicting the consequences of large-mammal declines and extinctions in a rapidly changing world. To date, measurements of responses to large-mammal removal have been idiosyncratic and opportunistic, and the mechanisms offered to explain underlying the responses are often speculative. Moreover, the few exclusion experiments conducted in species-rich ungulate guilds have mostly been ?all or none,? meaning that the effects of particular species or subgroups cannot be identified, whereas our sequential size-based exclusion approach will isolate these effects. Finally, this experiment is the first to combine large-herbivore exclusion with replication across multiple levels of an environmental gradient, which is consistent with recent calls for ecologists to address the context-dependence of species interactions.<br/> In terms of developing human capital and international collaboration, this project supports five full-time research assistants from local communities in rural Kenya. Their employment provides them with valuable, transferable skills (identification of native Kenyan biodiversity, data entry and computer training, management and teamwork experience). These men are also from different ethnic groups and religions in a region torn (as recently as January, 2008) by ethnic strife; working together cements bonds that overcome ethnic differences. Local people and their children will be taken on guided tours of the experimental facilities, allowing them to interact with biodiversity in an educational setting, which will promote environmental stewardship in the region. This project also involves collaboration among three research institutions in Kenya (as well as three universities in the US and Canada) that have long operated separately; this collaboration will build intra- and international partnerships and capacity that will facilitate future joint endeavors. The project also lays a foundation for future work on the poorly known invertebrates of this region. Lastly, the conservation and management implications of the work will be disseminated in short essays for non-scientific audiences to be published both in local Kenyan media and on the worldwide web."

However, such information is extremely difficult to obtain without stressing, harming, and/or capturing animals. This study develops a new, non-invasive method (blow-sampling) that involves collecting fluid exhaled from the blowhole and will explore the full potential of this biological sample. The individual life histories, reproduction, behavior, genetics, and ecology of more than 1200 Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia have been monitored since 1984. In addition, five adults and their offspring visit a beach (Monkey Mia) daily to receive fish from humans. Blow samples collected daily from these individuals will be used to develop assays of reproductive states, relatedness and diets, which can then be applied to evaluate these variables in the larger population. In a 2008 pilot study 90 blow samples from provisioned and non-provisioned dolphins were collected and mtDNA (maternally inherited) was extracted from their blow. These samples will be used to identify reproductive state through hormones, diet through fatty acids, health through disease presence, and kinship through mtDNA and nuclear DNA, which can then be correlated with age, sex, behavior, reproductive patterns and survival. This innovative and non-invasive project will acquire much-needed data for improving dolphin welfare, and can potentially set a new standard for biological sampling of cetaceans."

The theoretical problems are concerned with spectral properties of large dimensional random matrices. More precisely, four of the main objectives of the program are: 1) further develop new covariance estimation methods; 2) further our understanding of the spectral properties of relevant large random matrices; 3) find and contribute to areas of application where this high-dimensional statistics framework is relevant; 4) train graduate students in high-dimensional statistics and make undergraduate students at least aware of possible pitfalls of classical methods and of better alternatives when available. More specifically, statisticians are now often faced with ""n by p"" data matrices X, for which p, the number of variables recorded per observations, is of the same order of magnitude as n, the number of recorded observations, and p and n are both large. The sample covariance matrix computed from this data is of great importance to a number of applications, as it underlies widely used methods like principal components analysis. However, the theoretical results which underlie the method, classically developed in the ""small p and large n"" setting, fail to apply in the ""large n and large p"" setting just described. Hence, a thorough study of sample covariance matrices in this setting is needed. Eigenvalues of such large dimensional matrices are of particular interest. The investigator plans to launch a multi-pronged effort to get at various kinds of properties of these objects: for instance, he plans to develop theoretical results that will allow inferential work to be done from computation of extreme eigenvalues of sample covariance matrices, develop new methods of estimation of the whole covariance matrix, and also work on the impact of naively plugging-in the sample covariance matrix as a proxy for the population covariance in certain optimization problems which depend on this latter parameter. An effort will be made to try and apply this theoretical work to real-world problems, both to raise awareness in applied communities about the pitfalls associated with high-dimensional covariance matrices, and to shape the models that will be studied to be of most relevance to applied researchers.<br/><br/>Technological progress allows us to store and use massive amounts of data about many aspects of our daily lives. An interesting problem is to use the data to understand how certain traits depend on each other. In the stock market, we might be interested in how the behavior of one stock affects the behavior of another stock; understanding all these interrelationships leads to having a measure of the risk taken by investing in portfolios that use the corresponding stocks. Statisticians have a number of tools to deal with all these interrelationships. We can discover ways to look at the data so that, even if all interrelationships are small or weak, so each trait ""should"" not help us learn too much about any other trait, we might still find combinations of the traits that carry enormous amounts of information. We also know what typical values for these combinations are, so we might be able to detect unusual features in the data set by looking at it the right way. Those statistical techniques have very wide applications in various fields of science, ranging from climatology to genetics, image recognition, finance etc... Thousands of research papers are published each year that use these techniques. However, the theory that underlies these statistical techniques was created in an era where massive datasets just did not exist. This research project is focusing on theories and their applications that are better suited to handle our current massive datasets. The applications should allow us to see structure where the classical tools fail to see any and tell us when there is no structure when the classical tools tell us there is. We also have increasing evidence that our standard tools give us often very inaccurate results about our standard measures of risk or amount of information carried in combination of traits. It seems that risks might be underestimated and amount of information might be overestimated. Part of this research program will be dedicated to measuring how inaccurate the classical results are for large datasets, how much practical predictions are affected, and how a more relevant theory can be used for correcting these inaccuracies."
