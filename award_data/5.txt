The international team, led by Frederick Jelinek at Johns Hopkins, will investigate formal representations of linguistic meaning for use in speech recognition/reconstruction and machine translation (MT) systems. Their goal is to augment current speech recognition systems by applying a variety of formal models for deep syntactic/semantic representation so that output of their refined MT system becomes coherent, grammatical text.<br/><br/>The projects complementary education component involves introducing participating U.S. graduate students to European-developed linguistic formalisms and training them to apply those formalisms to problems in natural language processing.  Students will have language training in Czech or German and will spend at least one semester abroad where they will further their linguistic training in tectogrammatical representation at Charles University or head-driven phrase structure grammar at Saarland University.  In the final stages of their Ph.D. program, each will return to the Czech Republic or Germany to work with European mentors on research that incorporates these state-of-the art language processing techniques.  <br/><br/>Results from the collaborative research, annual workshops and cross-training should advance the field of computational linguistics by integrating formal meaning representations and statistical methods for natural language processing so that modern computer resources can be exploited to more rapidly translate verbal communications from other languages into English.  If successful, this work could revolutionize language modeling for automatic speech recognition so that even spontaneous speech may be translated into fluent, reconstructed text that efficiently captures the intended meaning of the original. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary PIRE in computational linguistics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.   Broader impacts include early career introduction of U.S. graduate students to an international professional network of leading linguists, computational theorists, and experts in human language technology. <br/>"

The SSCI, modeled after the Force Concept Inventory for Newtonian mechanics, consists of 25 multiple choice questions emphasizing conceptual understanding, not rote problem solving. The incorrect answers, or distractors, capture common student misconceptions. A group of faculty member from 12 diverse institutions, referred to as the Development Team, are providing pretest and posttest SSCI scores linked to grades, gender, and race data. These data are being used to examine the construct validity of the instrument and to check for evidence of bias in the results. The Development Team is assessing the content validity of the instrument through expert peer review of the SSCI questions. A test/re-test protocol is being used to calibrate the reliability of the instrument. Student interviews are providing additional data for the validity analysis. The group is preparing a SSCI Instructor Manual that will describe which student misconceptions are captured by each distractor. This manual will also guide the interpretation of results by providing baseline data on student performance and pretest/posttest gains for the SSCI.  Annual meetings of the Development Team are being used to monitor progress toward the project's objectives, each of which has been translated into a set of measurable outcomes and evaluation questions. Journal articles, conference presentations, the signals-and-systems.org website, and workshops at signal processing and engineering education conferences are being used to disseminate the SSCI and the study results."

A single teaspoon of ocean water often contains over 1 million individual microbial cells. Given limited differences in size and shape, distinguishing one species from another under the microscope is difficult. Associating specific functions with individual cells or populations is even more challenging. Marine microbes drive biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and other elements that are critical to the function of the biosphere. Understanding relationships between microbial diversity, microbial metabolism and biogeochemistry is one of the great challenges facing microbial ecologists today. Metaproteomics is a new and untried approach to identify proteins present in microbial communities.  Proteins are the engines that drive all chemical reactions in cells and can be used to identify specific microbes as each contains unique protein profiles.  Thus, identifying proteins in microbial communities will provide information about what microbes are present in a given sample and what they are doing at the time of sampling.  This research will apply metaproteomics to marine microbial communities to: 1) compare the protein expression patterns over geographic and temporal scales; 2) identify proteins of particular interest from specific samples; and 3) link specific microbial functions with individual microbial groups. Proteins extracted from microbial community samples will be resolved based on mass and charge to provide an image of the community protein profile.  Similarities and differences between different samples will be quantified by comparing these images. Sequence information for specific proteins of interest will be gathered and used to identify both the protein and most probable microbial source of the protein. <br/><br/>This project will provide the first in depth metaproteomic study of a dynamic and highly complex marine microbial assemblage.  Metaproteomics is an alternative and complementary approach to metagenomics and environmental transcriptomics.  Although many novel microorganisms have been detected in the ocean, the vast majority of marine microbes still cannot be grown in the laboratory.  As a culture-independent approach, metaproteomics will address what proteins are actually expressed in microbial communities rather than the potential expression measurements provided by metagenomics and transcriptomics. This project will support two graduate students and provide both with highly interdisciplinary training spanning the fields of microbial diversity, biological oceanography, analytical chemistry, and bioinformatics.<br/>"

Lobo<br/><br/>Institution:   University of Delaware<br/><br/>Analysis (rationale for decision):<br/><br/><br/>The project will investigate the self-assembly of organic-silica nanoparticles leading to the formation of zeolite crystals and mesoporous M41S type materials under hydrothermal conditions.  The structural evolution of the nanoparticles will be examined using small-angle scattering methods and optical spectroscopy to clarify the effect of the organic cation on the zeolite precursors.   Colloidal interactions between the particles will also be characterized.  The nanoparticles will be deposited on non-porous and porous supports to form silica films. The proposal is innovative and leading edge because of the focus on discovering the missing links between the molecular level chemistry in the solution state and the structural knowledge in the solid state. This elusive link has been one of the fundamental issues in zeolite synthesis.  The synthesis work will demonstrate how to use the fundamental information obtained either to improve the synthesis of existing materials or to serve as a foundation for the design of new materials with novel properties.  Based on these studies, it should also be possible to predict the particle-surface forces that determine the rate of deposition of silica onto growing silica surfaces.   The research will be highly fundamental with broad and important relevance to catalysis, colloid science, and crystallization. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the project would be focused on elementary and high school student recruitment for science and engineering.  A connection has been made with regional high schools that have a large minority population.  Undergraduate students will also be involved in the research through a University Scholars Program, which involves the completion of a thesis for a Degree with Distinction.  <br/><br/>"

These activities required individuals, groups, private companies, and government agencies to work together. Some had done so before, but many had not, yet they had to organize themselves and to coordinate their efforts under great stress, with changing and conflicting information, and with urgent needs for action. This project will study how they accomplished the evacuation and subsequent boat-lift of supplies: how they formed new relationships or relied on old ones, how they suspended existing procedures and developed new ones, how they gathered and exchanged information, and how they drew on old knowledge and new inspiration to form a rapidly-improvised but effective system for meeting the demands of an extraordinary crisis. The outcome of the study will be a framework for understanding how individuals and groups understand sudden change in their surroundings, how they communicate with others in complex environments, and how they develop new strategies for meeting emergency needs.<br/><br/>Findings from this research will be of use to researchers who are interested in understanding and improving people's ability to respond to crisis situations as well as to emergency management practitioners and to members of the general public, who are increasingly asked to be participants in planning for and responding to disasters in their communities. The study will examine how individuals and groups improvise and make sense of startling events that are outside their experience. Thus the results will add to the knowledge base of how people cope with large-scale disasters. Results will also include recommendations on ways to enhance the ability to respond to disastrous events, not just in government agencies, but also in the private sector where the ability to respond promptly to disaster has strong national economic implications. Findings from the research will also be incorporated directly into the teaching at two universities where substantial disaster management education takes place, so that students will be able to implement the results of the study in professional settings.<br/>"

Additionally, liquid lubricants in nano/micro-scale contacts have been known to disrupt dynamic operation of MEMs devices due to stiction between mating components.   Granular particles, proposed as dry lubricants, have been known to lower friction and separate sliding surfaces in shear cell experiments. While flowing granules have always been considered reminiscent of fluid flows, the granular flow scientific community has not had the same success in modeling these flows. Models have been developed to predict the behavior of flowing granules in hoppers, conveyors, inclines, and shear cells. However, these models have imposed gross assumptions (e.g., uniform particle sizes/shapes, frictionless surfaces, neglected gravity, etc.) and have been solved for the simplest cases and flow geometries. First principle statistical mechanics coupled with continuum approaches have provided modest and oftentimes qualitative-only agreement with experimental data.   Interacting granules at the macro-scale have been modeled using the same Navier-Stokes fluid models applied to liquids. The key difference is that constitutive relationships for mixture properties such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, and density must be derived for colliding granules and account for inelasticity. This suggests that a simplified, novel approach to modeling these discrete particle systems would be of great value. Lattice-based cellular automata (LBCA) modeling is the use of well-defined rules to develop a computer simulation capable of<br/>predicting real discrete, spatial-temporal systems such as these seen in granular flows. Discrete, temporal, particletype systems appear in tribology, biology, and nature as lubricating particulates, molecules monomers, and dry debris flows, respectively. Since the well-defined rules must come from observations of the real systems, experiments from which the rules can be derived must be developed.<br/>   <br/>The proposed SGER period will be rich in intellectual merit. We will develop a new lattice-based modeling<br/>approach for modeling granular lubrication flows, known as cellular automata, which is capable of simulating the interactions of colliding granules in a sliding contact geometry. The LBCA simulation is based on the rule-based mathematics of particle interaction that will be obtained from the granular journal bearing that will be developed in this work. Additionally, results from the CA simulations will be compared to those from existing continuum models.   The granular flow test bearing will be capable of measuring the flow parameters velocity, solid fraction, granular temperature and slip. It will have a transparent encasing to enable digital videography of the particle interactions and for developing the rules of collision. A digital particle tracking velocimetry (DPTV) scheme will be developed from the video, so that the data can be obtained from the granular bearing. This complex mechanical granular system will be the first granular-lubricated journal bearing to date. Fundamental to multi-component tribological flows, an experimental granular bearing capable of measuring tribological parameters would provide valuable insight into the behavior of these extremely complex flows in converging gap geometries. The LBCA modeling approach is capable<br/>of predicting the behavior of discrete, interacting particulate systems that evolve over time and this work will highlight its speed of implementation and flexibility in granular flows.<br/><br/>This work will broadly impact the future granular flow and tribology workforce by developing a web-based module for running LBCA for discrete temporal systems online. The module will be located on a website and a simple demo will be introduced at an urban Pittsburgh public high school. Additionally, the PI and graduate student will conduct presentations at the high school on the importance of developing new experiments and models for multi-component flows and hard to predict physics experiments. Lastly, this work would serve as a catalyst for increasing LBCA approached to predicting multi-component flows, namely granular flows for tribological applications."

CNS-ASU builds the capacity to address the societal implications of NSE by creating a broad institutional network, instituting a coherent research program, promoting innovative educational opportunities, and engaging in meaningful participation and outreach activities, especially with under-represented communities.  Its goal is nothing less than charting a path toward new ways of organizing the production of knowledge and developing and testing new processes of anticipatory governance to meet the emerging promises and challenges of NSE.<br/><br/>CNS-ASU joins Arizona State University with the University of Wisconsin - Madison, the Georgia Institute of Technology, North Carolina State University, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and other universities, individuals, and groups in the academic and private sector, as well as the International Nanotechnology and Society Network (www.nanoandsociety.org) that ASU is developing.  At ASU, the project's two guiding organizations are the Consortium for Science, Policy, and Outcomes (www.cspo.org), which provides an institutional home for science and technology policy scholarship and engagement, and the Biodesign Institute (www.biodesign.org), which provides a substrate of NSE research and a test bed for interdisciplinary collaboration.<br/>  <br/>CNS-ASU will implement a program of research and engagement called ""real-time technology assessment"" (RTTA), which consists of four methods of inquiry: mapping the research dynamics of the NSE enterprise and its anticipated societal outcomes; monitoring the changing values of the public and of researchers regarding NSE; engaging researchers and various publics in deliberative and participatory forums; and reflexively assessing the impact of the information and experiences generated by its activities on the values held and choices made by the NSE researchers in its network.  Through RTTA, CNS-ASU will probe the hypothesis that trajectories of NSE innovation can be steered toward socially desirable goals, and away from undesirable ones, by introducing a greater capacity for reflexiveness - that is, social learning that can expand the range of conscious choice - into knowledge-producing institutions.  It organizes the research around two broad NSE-in-society themes: freedom, privacy, and security; and human identity, enhancement, and biology.<br/><br/>The Center's educational and training plan includes innovations at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral level that encourage interdisciplinary opportunities among NSE students and social science and humanities students.  Partnerships with proven programs, including the Hispanic Research Center (www.asu.edu/clas/hrc) and the Center for Ubiquitous Computing (http://cubic.asu.edu), ensure recruitment and retention of students from under-represented groups.  A collaboration with the Center for Research on Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology (http://cresmet.asu.edu), CNS-ASU generates training modules for high school teachers in NSE-in-society.<br/><br/>Designed as a ""boundary organization"" at the interface of science and society, CNS-ASU provides an operational model for a new way to organize research through improved contextual awareness, which can signal emerging problems, enable anticipatory governance, and guide trajectories of NSE knowledge and innovation toward socially desirable outcomes, and away from undesirable ones. In pursuit of this broadest impact, CNS-ASU trains a cadre of interdisciplinary researchers to engage the complex societal implications of NSE; catalyzes more diverse, comprehensive, and adventurous interactions among a wide variety of publics potentially interested in and affected by NSE; and creates new levels of awareness about NSE-in-society among decision makers ranging from consumers to scientists to high level policy makers.<br/>"

One of the very real possibilities is the deployment of `smart dust', a vast network of radio transceivers, in order to monitor large areas and, possibly, track movements in that area.  Such `smart dust' is of any use only if the various transceivers are very cheap, use very little energy, so that they are around for a long time, and do not cost much to put in place.  In particular, the transceivers cannot be expected to be able to transmit far, and must be placed in essentially random positions.  This leads us to numerous mathematical problems, several of which we hope to attack.<br/><br/>For example, a mathematical model of one of many real-life problems goes as follows.  Suppose we have a large number of points (radio transceivers) in a square or circular disc, distributed at random.  Let N be the network obtained by connecting each point to the k points nearest to it (each transceiver can communicate with the k transceivers nearest to it).  How large should k be in order to make it likely that the network N is connected?  In other words, how large should k be to make it likely that, for any two transceivers x and y, a message can be sent from x to y via a sequence of transceivers, i.e., there are transceivers a, b, ... , u, such that the message can be sent from x to a, from a to b, etc., and finally from u to y.<br/><br/>There are numerous other mathematical problems related to ad hoc wireless networks: for example, in the problem above we may relax the requirement that the entire network be connected, and want only a large set of transceivers that can communicate with each other.  It also makes sense to care about the speed with which a message can be transmitted to faraway transceivers, and we may want to investigate how an efficient route can be identified.  In yet another problem, we should take into account the interference encountered if several nearby transceivers broadcast at the same time.<br/><br/>The problems above belong to the theory of random geometric graphs, an area started by Gilbert about 45 years ago, but, curiously, still not too well developed.  Our aim in this NSF project is to identify a number of problems that are not only of interest from the point of view of pure mathematics, but also have substantial applications to large ad hoc wireless networks."

It is an educational policy used to combat social promotion though there is little rigorous evidence about the causal effects (positive or negative) of retention on student outcomes.  Moreover, little is known about the effects of compensatory policies that many districts now operate in tandem with grade retention policies.  This project will adapt and refine an innovative statistical approach (Classification Trees) for use in causal estimation for observational studies, using it to investigate the effects of grade retention on students' cognitive and behavioral outcomes.  The project also will use an instrumental variables strategy to estimate effects of retention.  Importantly, effects will be allowed to vary depending on the mix of compensatory programs available to children to better understand the implications of the findings within specific school contexts.<br/><br/>Grade retention is an area that is ripe for further investigation given the lack of rigorous causal analyses, the improbability of a randomized experiment to assess its effect, the need to examine the effects of retention in conjunction with other compensatory policies, and the policy importance of the topic.  In addition, refinement of classification tree methods for use in causal inference will be useful for many researchers trying to answer causal questions in the absence of randomized experiments.

The Svalbard archipelago is already the site of numerous optical sensors and auroral imagers, multiple radars including EISCAT and SuperDARN, and is the location of the northernmost stations in the IMAGE array of fluxgate magnetometers.  This extensive array of instrumentation has been installed on Svalbard primarily because it is the only readily accessible site in the northern hemisphere at which the ionospheric footpoint of the magnetospheric cusp is consistently in darkness during the winter solstice.  Magnetic field lines from the cusp region map to the outer boundary of Earth's magnetosphere, where it interacts with the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field.  Because of this, ground stations located under the cusp region can provide information about the first entry of energy and momentum from the solar wind to Earth's ionosphere.  There is currently no search coil magnetometer array on Svalbard, however.  Deployment of a closely-spaced two-dimensional array of search coil instruments, each with accurate GPS timing, will allow the PIs to determine phase differences between signals observed at different sites, and hence determine apparent propagation directions and infer wave source locations.  In addition, the presence of a rich array of other instrumentation at several sites on Svalbard, especially under winter dark conditions, can provide detailed information on ionospheric regions that is not available at any other cusp latitude site. <br/><br/>This study will contribute to our understanding of, and ability to predict, space weather phenomena that can cause power outages and increase pipeline corrosion, produce radiation damage to satellites, and create problems in radio communications, amongst other problems.<br/><br/>"

Despite the importance of such strategies in people's professional, civic, and personal lives, adults as well as adolescents are typically poor at evaluating and interpreting research evidence. The project has three subgoals. The first subgoal is theoretical: To advance our understanding of how students learn to reason scientifically. The second goal is instructional: To study how to teach strategies that people need to evaluate and interpret scientific research. The third subgoal is methodological: To develop techniques for adapting the microgenetic technique, involving small-grained quantitative and qualitative analyses, to classroom settings. The two proposed studies will be conducted in diverse New Jersey middle schools. Study 1 will be an expert-novice study investigating the nature of students' tacit reasoning schemas and how students' schemas differ conceptually from experts'. This study will generate an understanding of the kinds of conceptual changes that are involved in learning reasoning schemas. Study 2 will be a microgenetic study that tracks students in six classes over 4 to 5 months as they learn from instruction that incorporates reasoning seminars. Building on preliminary work with middle school students, the project will develop seminars modeled on graduate research seminars. The research seminars will be implemented by integrating a variety of evidence evaluation activities into the middle-school life-sciences curriculum, including dramatic research scenarios, hands-on inquiry, PDA-based simulations, discussions of media reports of research, and multiple study evaluations. The overall goals of Study 2 are (a) to trace patterns of change in students' argumentation and reasoning and (b) to gain an understanding of the instructional events that engender these changes."

Beamish<br/>'Bio-Safety' or 'Bio-Hazard'? Organizational Pursuit and Community response to a Safety and Preparedness Initiative<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>This study investigates community response to the proposed installation of National Bioncontainment Laboratories (NBL) in three U.S. communities. The NBL have been billed by the federal government as the frontline in providing local, regional, and national protection from the world's most virulent pathogens. In each case, reputable Universities with mature medical facilities and strong reputations in related fields of study responded to a National Institutes of Health RFP to sponsor and manage the NBL for the federal government. Yet, a remarkable range of reactions to the NBL's ostensibly safety enhancing initiative-strong opposition (Davis, CA), growing opposition (Boston, MA), no significant opposition (Galveston, TX)-highlights the importance of understanding variable response to programs intended to minimize risk and increase public security and preparedness. The general questions the project seeks to answer include: (1) What factors help explain variable interpretation by the lay-public of the same initiative as, for some, promoting ""safety"" and for others promoting ""risks?"" And, (2) What role does policy construction and the strategic pursuit of this initiative by the sponsor organizations play in the NBLs acceptance and/or rejection by surrounding communities? These questions will be investigated through case comparison in which each location is the unit of analysis--both the community and associated NBL sponsor organization. The project will rely on a multi-method approach involving in-depth interviews, field study, media analysis, and archival records to draw conclusions. Triangulation of these data will provide the basis for conclusions.<br/><br/>The project research objectives and anticipated contributions are threefold: (1) to improve knowledge and theory concerning the basis for community impressions of ""what is safe"" and ""what is safety enhancing;"" (2) to document how community conceptions of the NBL, as a public health and preparedness initiative, effect(ed) the policy implementation process; and (3) to suggest general administration and policy options that will aid in the creation and implementation of preparedness initiatives that the public more readily accepts and/or that they are less likely to rejected. <br/>"

These activities required individuals, groups, private companies, and government agencies to work together. Some had done so before, but many had not, yet they had to organize themselves and to coordinate their efforts under great stress, with changing and conflicting information, and with urgent needs for action. This project will study how they accomplished the evacuation and subsequent boat-lift of supplies: how they formed new relationships or relied on old ones, how they suspended existing procedures and developed new ones, how they gathered and exchanged information, and how they drew on old knowledge and new inspiration to form a rapidly-improvised but effective system for meeting the demands of an extraordinary crisis. The outcome of the study will be a framework for understanding how individuals and groups understand sudden change in their surroundings, how they communicate with others in complex environments, and how they develop new strategies for meeting emergency needs.<br/><br/>Findings from this research will be of use to researchers who are interested in understanding and improving people's ability to respond to crisis situations as well as to emergency management practitioners and to members of the general public, who are increasingly asked to be participants in planning for and responding to disasters in their communities.

Thus the results will add to the knowledge base of how people cope with large-scale disasters. Results will also include recommendations on ways to enhance the ability to respond to disastrous events, not just in government agencies, but also in the private sector where the ability to respond promptly to disaster has strong national economic implications. Findings from the research will also be incorporated directly into the teaching at two universities where substantial disaster management education takes place, so that students will be able to implement the results of the study in professional settings.<br/>"

The substantive policymaking problem is that local government capacity for, and commitment to, preparedness (planning activities, placement of resources, personnel training, etc.) on natural or technological hazards is often very uneven across the United States.  This is important because effective homeland security necessarily relies on local governments to be proactive in dealing with potential terror incidents as a hazard; if some, or many, local governments are either unwilling or unable to be proactive, then the nation is likely more vulnerable to attack.  A key question to explore is: what exactly explains local government effort in preparing for terrorism as a hazard?  To address the question, this project builds on an earlier pilot study (conducted in March 2004) which gathered information on homeland security preparedness at the local level through a nationwide mail survey of local government officials. This project extends that study by: constructing an expanded sample frame that includes both city and county officials; expanding the survey instrument on several key issues; gathering a more complete set of objective performance indicators; and conducting several case studies of different types of cities to provide greater depth to the explanation of local government preparedness efforts. The significance of the research project is that it addresses what factors determine effective hazards management policy in a federal system where, very often, the policymaking incentives facing national and state and local governments diverge. The expectation for this project is that it will identify a specific set of causal factors that explain hazard management preparedness at the local government generally, and homeland security activities specifically.<br/>"

Hines, Tufts University<br/><br/>Motivation & Scope: Significantly lighter members for structural walls in moderate seismic zones are a viable possibility by using high-strength concrete and incorporating ductile shear failures as a new genre of ductile failure mechanisms. Recent research on the seismic design of hollow piers has provided new insights on the accurate assessment of elastic and inelastic web crushing shear capacity of structural walls with boundary elements. Ductile shear failures, displayed as web crushing failures or yielding of the transverse reinforcement at relatively high levels of displacement ductility, allow for easy repair since damage to the boundary elements can be minimal. The advent of high-strength concrete has generated great interest in the promise that it may provide for cost-effective seismic design. However, its potential cannot be fully realized due to current outdated and prescriptive design criteria. Rational assessment models show that web crushing is linearly related to concrete compressive strength, indicative of new possibilities for increased shear capacities of lighter members with increased concrete strength. This project will verify this promise by establishing the inelastic web crushing limits for structural walls. <br/><br/>Objectives: The goal of this project is to investigate and establish rational performance levels for the development of seismic assessment and design approaches to high-strength-concrete (HSC) structural walls based on ductile shear failure mechanisms. Specifically, the project will: (1) investigate and establish the web-crushing performance limits of HSC structural walls at moderate ductility, (2) investigate the bi-directional seismic performance of structural wall assemblies in the context of hollow piers, (3) develop analytical modeling and analysis procedures for structural walls with boundary elements, and (4) develop simple assessment models for HSC structural walls.<br/><br/>Approach: The research objectives will be achieved through integrated experimental and analytical investigations.  The first part of the experimental investigation will focus on the determination of dependable limits to web crushing failures for ductile shear response in HSC structural walls through 8 quasi-static monotonic and cyclic tests on 1/4-scale walls with concrete strengths of 34, 69, 103, and 137 MPa. Parallel analytical investigations will focus on the development and validation of assessment tools for structural walls loaded in their principal and diagonal directions through 3D nonlinear finite element models and simpler sectional analyses. Using the improved assessment models, two 1/4-scale HSC (137 MPa) wall assemblies analogous to hollow piers will be designed and tested under bidirectional loading. One assembly will be designed to obtain a web crushing failure at low ductility levels to validate the established limits for systems under combined loading. The second unit will be designed to fail in a ductile shear failure mode at high ductility levels. Conventional and advanced non-contact strain measurements will be correlated<br/>with analysis results to fundamentally understand the associated deformation limits. Rational, yet simple, assessment models will be developed to provide designers with practical tools for the design of HSC structural walls with reliable ductile shear failure modes. A website will be developed to disseminate results to researchers, designers, educators and students. Transition to practice will be pursed by active participation of the PIs in technical committees.<br/><br/>NEES Use: The research plan will strategically combine the experimental resources of Michigan State University's Civil Infrastructure Laboratory to conduct the required conventional pseudo-static investigations, and the new capabilities provided by the Multi-Axial Subassemblage Testing (MAST) NEES facility at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities to evaluate the bi-directional performance of structural wall assemblies.<br/><br/>Collaborative Elements: The research team consists of collaboration between Michigan State University and Tufts University, which combines strengths and resources in experimentation, analysis, design practice and education. The research effort will be assisted by an external advisory board with significant project-related experience.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Increased understanding of earthquake design principles has become so robust that seismic<br/>safety is rarely compromised. Rather, advancement in materials science, increased knowledge on structural behavior and the availability to perform complex computational simulations indicate a proper moment to migrate from current conservatism towards improvements in immediate and long-term cost and enhancement of structural elegance without sacrificing safety. The establishment of performance limits for high-strength-concrete structural walls behaving in alternative ductile modes of failure is expected to contribute to the groundwork of the next stage in earthquake engineering design of thin-webbed elements and systems.<br/><br/>Broad Impact: The project will integrate the research efforts to the educational missions of both collaborative institutions by fostering knowledge in earthquake engineering through: (a) training of two graduate students, (b) research experiences for two undergraduates from underrepresented groups, and (c) enhanced teaching curricula. A determined attempt will be made to recruit underrepresented graduate students using university programs. The research will contribute to the groundwork of the next stage in seismic design by migrating from conservative approaches through establishment of rational performance limits for HSC in ductile shear failure modes."

The project aims at making fundamental contributions to the necessarily<br/>multidisciplinary systems required for data utilization in monitoring and control of interconnected<br/>engineering systems. The application that this proposal focuses on is the creation of new data-driven tools for electric power system operation and control. The applications systems include traditional SCADA systems as well as the emerging Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data concentrators. This effort will focus on five specific task areas:  Distributed agent-based system monitoring; Pattern recognition and change detection; Dynamic analysis of signatures for early warning;  Data-driven, low-order modeling for security assessment;  Automated visualization for power system health monitoring. This work will provide a broader impact in several areas. First, the results in data manipulation, visualization, and processing will have application in other domains. Any complex system that relies heavily on measurements for monitoring and control shares the same need to extract key information from massive amounts of data received over wide areas and time scales. Second, several of the investigators work very closely with the electric power industry through the Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSERC), an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center designed to stimulate collaboration among 13 universities and 35 companies.

In particular, research focused on the mechanisms leading to lake-effect convective boundary layer growth and mesoscale circulations, and how they differ from oceanic marine boundary layers, has helped stimulate these improvements.  In addition, results and tools from these earlier research studies have allowed for initial investigations of complex processes associated with ""non-classic"" lake-effect storms, where lake effect systems are modified by synoptic or sub-synoptic phenomena or upwind air masses are modified by neighboring lakes.  As a result of prior NSF supported research, the Principal Investigators reported on investigations of several non-classic lake-effect systems including (1) enhanced snowfall caused by seeding of lake-effect clouds by higher level cloud layers, (2) convective cloud bands that develop over a lake and extend across an intervening land mass to a second downwind lake, and (3) synoptic frontal modifications resulting from the interaction with a large mid-latitude lake. <br/><br/>This research project seeks to build on past research results and address unanswered scientific questions using new observations and numerical models to broaden understanding of non-classic lake-effect systems and environments.  Specific research objectives are to: (1) use unique observations from the Great Lakes Ice Cover-Atmospheric Flux (GLICAF) project to understand and quantify the relationship of surface fluxes to heterogeneous pack ice concentrations, (2) use case-study, climatic, and numerical model simulations to understand the structure of multiple-lake bands and the influence of environmental parameters on their development and evolution, (3) quantify the influence of environmental conditions on cold frontal structure and evolution as synoptic fronts interact with lake-effect systems, (4) use Doppler radar measurements, accompanied by atmospheric and environmental datasets to determine the favorable conditions and the organization of mesoscale snow events associated with lake-effect systems over small mid-latitude lakes, and (5) examine cloud and ice spectrum characteristics, as well as radiative flux profiles, across a range of lake-effect systems.  <br/><br/>Results of this research will give valuable insight into complex processes that often complicate winter forecasting of mesoscale phenomena common to the Great Lakes region.  These results will be communicated to the meteorological community through journal and conference articles and to the operational community through regional workshops and presentations at National Weather Service offices."

QMC is one among the most precise known techniques to study realistic materials in physics and chemistry and provide a significant gain in precision compared traditional density functional theory (DFT) approaches. This will bring electronic structure quantum Monte Carlo methodology to a qualitatively higher level of applicability to complex materials and lead to increased accuracy. The new QMC techniques will be applied to forefront problems in the properties of Earth materials in order to obtain accurate equations of state, phase transitions, and elasticity of solid materials that are of high interest in geophysics. One significant limitation of today's QMC methods is the high computational demand, which currently makes applications to larger systems including solid solutions prohibitively expensive. A substantial portion of the QMC computation is spent on forming and evaluating a Slater determinant, which is constructed from one-particle orbitals. The team plans to develop and apply different localization transformations in order to obtain a sparse determinant. Two linear algebra methods will be developed for their efficient evaluation. First, Krylov's method for the iterative evaluation of a determinant will be incorporated into QMC. Secondly, the trace of the determinant will be calculated with Monte Carlo methods.

This is achieved through realistic video and sound reconstruction of the activities in three-dimensional (3D) space in real time. Several components of these tele-immersive environments need to be in place to achieve seamless immersive experience: (a) set of cameras covering the 360 degree space in which the activity is taking place, hence creating 3D data sets, (b) sound system recovering sound from 360 degrees without echo, (c) broadband networking technology that enables throughput of large data sets across geographically distributed sites (end-to-end) with minimal latency and synchronous delivery, and (d) display technologies to display data from different sites in a consistent fashion. Many components of the tele-immersive environments have been developed, and preliminary small scale experiments with individual and customized components have been performed. <br/><br/>What is missing is a holistic deployment and experimentation with the current existing tele- immersive components. In this one-year project, we aim to (1) integrate current COTS components that are available on the market for tele-immersive environments, such as the current 3D cameras, wireless sound system, Internet2 protocols, and existing plasma and projector-type displays, (2) deploy the integrated COTS components at two geographically distributed sites, UC Berkeley and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and (3) test and execute preliminary experiments with our holistic integrated system, called Tele-immersive Environment for EVErybody (TEEVE). This integration and deployment will present very unique results because they will enable testing of the existing COTS components and their capabilities and limitations to deliver cutting-edge technology to broader audience. We expect also that the integration and deployment will reveal future research challenges since we plan to perform extensive experimental analysis of the TEEVE system. Our experimental analysis will span from network-based measurements where we plan to measure and evaluate accomplished bandwidth across Internet2 when sending large number of audio and video streams, accomplished latency, jitter, loss rate, response time, compression ratio on real-time 3D data, vision-based measurements where we plan to measure the correctness of existing 3D reconstruction algorithms in terms of semantics and real-time behavior, to user-based measurements where we plan to experiment with the tai-chi teacher at the UC Berkeley side and question students at the UIUC side about their experience versus using a standard video tape.<br/><br/>The intellectual Merit rests in (1) the extensive integration of COTS components which will consider and analyze the multiple configurations and synchronization mechanisms possible in our multi-tier system, (2) the deployment and experimentation with the integrated system, measuring the various metrics at different system/user levels, and (3) integration guidelines and setup methodologies how to put together such a holistic tele-immersive infrastructure like TEEVE. Experiences and experimental results will be shared with the research community in the form of documentation, software, and tutorial(s) at conferences such as ACM Multimedia, IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) and others.<br/><br/>Broader impacts will derive from the fact that will be the first holistic deployment of an affordable tele-immersive Internet-based infrastructure. TEEVE is the first step to allow sharing of activities that require full body visual and auditory information across geographically distributed sites. Examples exist in health care such as physical therapy to users in remote locations (e.g., Indians, Eskimos), in training of sport activities such as tai-chi, or in art training such as dancing. <br/><br/>"

Stable isotope analysis traces the flow of nutrients through communities and permits an estimate of the dietary inputs of animals.

Accurate flux parameterizations are particularly important at high wind conditions as demonstrated by recent hurricane prediction model studies. Yet, ther present air-sea flux parameterizations in the operational models are based on simple bulk formulas and are clearly far from satisfactory. Increasing observational evidences suggest that air-sea fluxes strongly depend on sea states. Recently, the lead investigator and his colleagues have developed a new model of the wave boundary layer (the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer that is directly influenced by surface waves) based on the fundamental principles of conservation of energy and momentum across the boundary layer. The model has been coupled with surface wave models to predict the equivalent surface roughness and the drag coefficient over mature, growing, and complex seas. In particular, the model predicts reduced levels of the drag coefficient at very high winds under hurricane conditions, consistent with recent field and laboratory observations. One shortcoming of the present model is that it does not include the effect of surface breaking waves on the wave boundary layer.<br/><br/>The proposed model of the wave boundary layer and the equilibrium wave spectrum will be based on the following hypotheses: (1) Breaking waves significantly modify the  structure of the wave boundary layer and the resulting air-sea momentum flux under strong wind forcing. (2) Breaking wave effects on the air-sea momentum flux can be quantified accurately if the existing wave boundary layer model is extended to incorporate the effect of the form drag due to breaking wave crests and the effect of airflow separation behind breaking wave crests that effectively shelters shorter waves from direct wind forcing (spatial sheltering effect), provided the surface wave spectrum and the breaking wave statistics are known. (3) In the equilibrium range, the surface wave spectrum and the breaking wave statistics may also be predicted together with the air-sea momentum flux. The model will explicitly include the form drag and airflow separation effects and will be used to predict the drag coefficient under high wind conditions. Next, each component of the model will be validated against new laboratory observations carried out at the University of Miami. The experiment is specifically designed for the model validation and provides simultaneous measurements of the total wind stress, the surface viscous stress, the surface wave spectrum, and the breaking wave statistics. The proposed development will be done in close collaboration with Stephen Belcher at the university of Reading, UK. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed study of the wave boundary layer and the equilibrium wave spectrum will be an important and essential step towards our ultimate goal of developing a new set of parameterizations of air-sea fluxes, which will be valid for the whole range of wind speeds and surface wave conditions and can be used as improved boundary conditions for high-resolution numerical models of ocean, atmosphere, and coupled ocean/atmosphere systems, including the tropical cyclone prediction models. Therefore, this research addresses social needs to improve weather forecast (in particular, tropical cyclone forecast) and to reduce natural hazards caused by extreme wind and wave conditions. The project includes the development of a new experimental technique to estimate the breaking wave statistics. Quantifying surface breaking wave events is extremely important for all aspects of the air-sea interaction studies. The project also involves the education and training of one graduate student. The student will learn both laboratory experimental techniques and theoretical/numerical modeling approaches to study breaking wave effects on air-sea interaction processes. Finally, an existing international collaboration will be fostered.<br/><br/>"

The mechanisms of drought are to be worked out by detailed analysis of observations and model simulations of the period of instrumental observations (post 1856). This knowledge will be applied to understanding drought over the last millennium and in the mid-Holocene in an attempt to attribute the paleohydrological variations to changes in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation recorded by tropical Pacific corals. <br/><br/>Tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures will be estimated for periods within the last 1100 years and for the mid-Holocene using fossil coral records and then used to force ensemble integrations of a climate model.

The project is led by Dr. Peter Glynn and builds on a 35-year database of physical and biological studies, and involves a coordinated Latin American/U.S. network of teams working principally in Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador (mainland and Galapagos Islands). <br/><br/>Intellectual merit. The chief objectives of this project are to continue and expand investigation into the causes of coral reef decline (both immediate and long-term), and the responses of reef coral populations, communities and ecosystem function in relation to ENSO disturbances. Key directions are investigations into mechanisms supporting documented rapid recovery, limitations to recovery that provide insight into ecosystem function, and the potential for eastern Pacific reefs to act as model systems to understand future impacts of global change in other reef systems. <br/><br/>Three elements of special significance that justify continuation of this multifaceted study are:<br/>(1) the long-term data base of eastern Pacific coral reef structure and reef-associated community composition pre-dating the first documented coral bleaching events of the 1980s, <br/>(2) the causal relationship between global warming and reef degradation with demonstrable effects on coral community structure, coral growth and reef accretion, and coral framework erosion, and <br/>(3) assessing future response potential and the capacity for acclimatization/adaptation in light of cumulative past responses. <br/><br/>New initiatives in the continuing project include (a) experiments relating coral reproduction and algal symbiont community structure during periods of temperature change, (b) characterization of deep reef thermal conditions vis-a-vis coral refugia, (c) field observations/experiments to compare effects of reef framework loss on metazoan recruitment, species diversity, and feeding rates, (d) coring reef frames to reveal taphonomic signatures of known ENSO events in order to determine the frequency of previous events, (e) relating carbonate chemistry of reef waters, e.g., pH, alkalinity and aragonite saturation states, to coral skeletal growth and density, (f) investigations into trophic structure complexity using N, C and S isotopes, (g) genetic structure of coral host and symbiont populations utilizing molecular and ribosomal DNA and protein electrophoresis to document shifts in thermally-tolerant groups, and (h) modeling of energy flow and ecosystem trophic processes and complexity. <br/><br/>Broader impacts. Peer reviewed publications now number 60, contributing to the disciplines of oceanography, paleoecology/paleoclimatology, geology, disturbance ecology (community recovery, phase shifts), trophodynamics, population dynamics (coral reproduction and recruitment, modeling, genetic structure and connectivity), and symbiont ecology. To date, 107 graduate and undergraduate students from Panama, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Colombia and the USA (plus 9 other countries) have participated in the project, resulting in the completion of 39 Ph.D. dissertations, M.S. theses and Honors reports. Students are trained in field methods for physical and biological sampling, species identifications, underwater and laboratory experiments (including instrumentation, design and data analysis), and train others in their respective countries. <br/><br/>These studies of ecological processes have aided in the establishment and management efforts of marine protected areas in Costa Rica (Cano Island National Park), Panama (Coiba National Park), and Ecuador (Galapagos National Park). In addition to international efforts, collaborator Peggy Fong has mentored 2 to 6 undergraduate researchers per quarter at UCLA over the last 10 years, many of whom are under-represented minorities in the federally supported outreach program. <br/>"

It features a new theoretical basis for three-dimensional, numerical ocean models conjoined with surface wave models. Nevertheless, additional empirical rules such as those extant in turbulence closure schemes and prominent in the modeling of surface boundary layers are needed. The marriage of surface layer (or mixed layer) models and surface wave models poses new questions and requires new thinking and data. It is expected that many of the unknowns can be addressed by detailed measurements only available in a laboratory setting as described below, thence on to available field data. First, a circulation model for mean properties dependent on one horizontal and one vertical dimension (essentially a channel or wave tank flow) will be set up together with a surface wave model. The model will encompass Stokes drift, vertically dependent wave radiation stress terms and other processes and will require a new critical look at means of representing turbulence mixing. There will be a need to distinguish between total momentum input from wind and that portion which contributes to wave buildup or wave decay. Bottom boundary layer - wave interaction will also be a component of the overall model.<br/><br/>The laboratory experiments will be designed to test critical aspects of the model, in particular those processes that involve interactions between wave induced motions and turbulent flow. The existing laboratory tank and measuring equipment is well suited to examine: a) the characteristics of mechanical (paddle) or wind-generated waves; b) turbulent flow in a 2-D slice, usually a plane normal to the cross-tank axis, c) fine scale structure of the turbulence including direct estimates of the rate of kinetic energy dissipation; d) turbulent velocities and pressure above the surface and estimates of the momentum transfer from wind to waves; e) methods of separating the flow variables into their mean, wave-related and turbulent parts.<br/><br/>The anticipated results of this research will be a combined three-dimensional, current-wave-turbulence model which includes sub-models for wind forcing, surface wave breaking, bottom friction and other empirical ingredients supported by data obtained from the proposed experiments and data available in the oceanographic literature. The model will be a precursor to wave dependent air/sea transfer of climate relevant gases.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts : This new model will have many broader impacts within the research community. The Princeton Ocean Model developed by Dr. Mellor and colleagues has been applied worldwide to understand the dynamics of many diverse oceanographic systems. The development of advanced community models such as those proposed here that deal with wave dynamics and the interactions of waves and turbulence, are essential building blocks for fully coupled atmosphere-interface-ocean models. Such models are necessary for understanding and predicting such important environmental processes as: pathways and accumulation of anthropogenic pollutants, climate change and the spread or extinction of marine species. The results from both the modeling and experimental components of this research will be available at a dedicated web site. This will provide the broader community with up-to date information on the progress of the research. Final results will be disseminated through refereed publications as the extensive track record of the investigators demonstrates. Additional impacts of the research will be through graduate student support and the improved capabilities of the Air-Sea Interaction Salt-water Tank (ASIST) facility at the University of Miami. ASIST is an excellent tool for instruction in wind-wave-current interaction at all levels. A laboratory course that demonstrates basic principles of wave theory and boundary layer turbulence has been developed at the University of Miami. The facility has also sponsored summer internships from several institutions including the French Naval Academy and the University of Toulon. Given the success of these projects we expect to continue to provide internship opportunities. Community outreach has been a significant ongoing activity at ASIST. Many campus and community groups will continue to be introduced to wind/wave interaction studies through tours of the facility.<br/><br/>"

Present instrumentation includes meteorological packages, ADCPs, surface and bottom CTDs, fluorometers and PAR sensors. The observatory instrumentation will be used to characterize the seabed response to physical forces acting across a spectrum of time scales. The frequency, intensity, and timing of energetic events will be detected within the water column, and their manifestation within the BBL will be followed. BBL instrumentation will measure thresholds of bed motion and characterize near-bed suspended loads, and will be used to estimate pressure fields and advective fluxes at the interface. In situ geochemical sensors will be used to characterize rates of advection of properties within the sediment and connect those properties to both physical forcing above the interface and biological forcing driven by seasonal and diurnal cues.

Real-time distance education course, Ethics of the Nanoscale, will be transmitted to freshman and sophomore students at Tuskegee University and Auburn University at Montgomery.  Modules on nanotechnology and its ethical, societal, and environmental implications will be taught in three core curriculum courses for freshman/sophomore students from all disciplines. A nanotechnology and ethics module will be included in the Auburn University Summer Bridge Program for incoming minority science, engineering and pre medicine freshmen.  Experts in nanotechnology, the ethical issues of nanotechnology and its applications will present seminars to the previously mentioned classes and give seminars to faculty, graduate students, and upper division undergraduates.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity. It is imperative that future scientists, engineers, social scientists, and ethicists understand the ethical, societal, and environmental implications of emerging scientific and engineering technologies. These issues must be considered and discussed as discoveries are being made and the technology developed. Ethical discussions concerning the impact of the discoveries on society and environment that occur during the discovery process will result in appropriate safeguards being put in place to protect society and the environment. Teaching integrated concepts of both nanoscience and ethics to university freshmen and sophomore presents new opportunities for development of critical thinking and analysis skills among students. This approach will strengthen their cognitive abilities and give them the ability to analyze in ethical terms advances in nanotechnology and other scientific and engineering fields.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity. Through these courses, university students, as part of the electorate, will come to understand that every emerging technology has its associated ethical questions, risks, and issues that must be understood, debated and, ideally, eventually accepted or rejected by the citizenry via electoral and legislative processes. Developing and teaching these courses and assessing and evaluating their impact on students' thinking and ethical views will provide faculty with a solid framework for improving our pedagogy in this area. Dissemination of the results from this project will provide the foundation for the development of new courses that integrate our social and ethical responsibilities with knowledge of emerging scientific and engineering technologies and will strengthen America's undergraduate education.<br/>"

The impact of this convective response upon the ensuing evolution of an externally forced tropical cyclone will also be examined.  In the particular case of a vertically sheared tropical cyclone, convection has been argued to have both positive and negative influences on vortex structure and intensity.  This study will attempt to define the role of convection by examining the impact of vertical shear on a moist-convective vortex within a simplified wave-mean dynamical framework. <br/><br/>The research employs a combined observational and numerical modeling approach.  The observations include airborne dual-Doppler radar measurements within a rapidly intensifying, yet vertically-sheared, hurricane.  A unique three-dimensional documentation of the hurricane structure and evolution, including the eyewall interface and upper-tropospheric vortex circulation, will be used to examine the nature, timing, and location of convection within the vortex core.  These observations will be used to represent convection in a series of idealized numerical simulations.  The idealized simulations are designed to elucidate the role of convection in tropical cyclone resiliency and to determine how and when convection begins to impact the tropical cyclone negatively. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The research will provide new insights into i) the observed three-dimensional mixing between eye and eyewall within a rapidly intensifying hurricane, ii) the observed convective asymmetry within a vertically-sheared hurricane, iii) the role of convection in vertically-sheared hurricane resiliency, and iv) the role of deep cumulus convection in the weakening of a vertically-sheared hurricane.<br/> <br/>Broader Impacts: The research activities will have several broader impacts.  Regarding hurricanes: Presently, there exists a single observational study of the three-dimensional hurricane vorticity dynamics.  The case study to be undertaken will be an important step towards increasing the statistical database of three-dimensional observations, which is crucial if such data are to be meaningfully assimilated into mesoscale numerical forecast models.  Additionally, the mapping of effective stratification based on observed data within the hurricane core may be used by future investigators for idealized numerical modeling.  More generally: The convection-vortex interaction is a general atmospheric problem (e.g., mid-latitude MCVs) and has parallels with the convectively-coupled equatorial wave problem.  This study will draw upon this broader knowledge base, and in return will contribute beyond the scope of hurricanes.  Two graduate students and an undergraduate will be trained in the techniques of radar data editing and analysis, atmospheric dynamics, and numerical modeling.  These students will also be encouraged to interact with scientists at NOAA's Hurricane Research Division through their ongoing cooperation with the universities."

This variability is caused by internal processes and external (to the ACS) influences. Methods from dynamical systems theory will be used to study the internal variability of the ACS and to develop a new dynamical theory of retroflection and ring formation. Output from a high horizontal (1/32) resolution Navy Layered Ocean Model (NLOM) simulation over the years 1979-2002 will be used to evaluate the importance of internal dynamics on the low-frequency variability of the ACS (versus external causes). This study is motivated by recent observations showing the existence of strong low-frequency (interannual-to-decadal) variability of the upper layer transport in the Agulhas Current retroflection region, and suggesting that there is a strong correspondence between maximum transport values and ring shedding events. It is also motivated by recent paleoceanographic proxy analyses indicating that during a glacial period, the Agulhas rings in- flux was significantly reduced. The influx, however, dramatically increased towards the end of the glacial period. It has been suggested that, due to salt anomalies carried by the rings, this increase of influx contributed to the re-start of deep water formation in the Atlantic. Although there are presently separate theories for both retroflection and ring formation, there is no satisfying theory connecting both phenomena as well as explaining their interannual variability. Without answers to these questions, the theory on the behavior of the ACS will stay incomplete. The dynamical systems study of the Agulhas Current fits also a broader attempt to determine systematically the solution structure, in particular the transitions to complex behavior of those solutions, in a hierarchy of ocean models of western boundary currents. <br/>"

In order to accomplish these objectives, three hypotheses will guide the research: 1) that the values embedded in computational models will partially, but not fully, correspond to those found in sociology and science and technology studies literatures, but additional values specific to computational models will also be identified; 2) that the ethical frameworks of the organization and the profession partially, but not fully, determine what values are embedded during the modeling process; and 3) that the embedding of values in computational models is a significant aspect of their development, and thus that the success or failure of a model as a product is partially, but not fully, determined by what values are embedded during the modeling process.  This project emerges at the intersection of the process of modeling and the ethics of modeling. These two threads are inseparably interlinked, since professional and organizational ethics play a role in shaping the process of modeling, while an understanding of the process of modeling is necessary in order to understand how values become embedded in computational models.  To test these hypotheses and achieve these objectives, it is necessary to employ a multiple-methodology approach to data collection and analysis. At the selected field site, a computational modeling laboratory, the researchers will utilize structured questionnaires, interviews, participant observation, and focus groups to study the process of computational modeling.  Data analysis will be both quantitative and qualitative, and will be based on statistical methodologies, behavioral analysis, and content analysis. The purposes of this exploratory study are to demonstrate the validity of the proposed methodology by conducting all four data collection approaches with corresponding data analyses for one field site, while at the same time producing valuable data about the ethical implications of values embedded in computational models.  This project builds on the experience and strengths of both researchers, including prior NSF-sponsored research. One of the PIs has forty years of experience as a computational modeler, including research on the ethics of modeling, while the other PI has an educational background in computer science, anthropology, and science and technology studies. This study, first, aims to contribute to the literature on the ethics of modeling by providing an in-depth case study of the ethics and values of computational modeling. Second, the methodology for conducting in-depth field data collection and analysis will contribute to the literature on professional and organizational culture and ethics. Finally, the study will also contribute by bringing together the literatures on models as products and modeling as a process, which can lead to a better understanding of the effect that embedding specific values during the process of computational modeling can have on the success of the computational model as a product.   The first social contribution of this study will be to improve the practice of computational modeling by demonstrating to modelers how values are embedded in the models that they produce and the ethical implications of these embedded values. A second social contribution of this study will be to make modelers more aware of the constraints of their organizational cultures. Finally, the findings of this and subsequent research can eventually lead to the development of online modules for educating computer science students in the ethics of modeling, which would provide computer science programs with a free resource that they could use to develop ethics courses."

The asymptotic behavior of the Boussinesq approximation of Rayleigh-Benard convection in the regime of large Prandtl number or small Ekman number.  For the large Prandtl number regime, the goal is to derive effective dynamics uniformly valid in time and investigate the validity of such approximation in terms of orbital convergence and convergence in the statistical sense.  Another goal here is to investigate asymptotic behavior at large time and large Rayleigh number of the simplified infinite Prandtl number model.  For the small Ekman number case, the objective is to derive the leading order of the rate of heat transport in the vertical direction.  2. The long time asymptotic behavior of two-dimensional flows under the bombardment of small-scale vortices.  Here the goal is to explain the numerically observed phenomena of emergence of large-scale coherent structures when the flow is forced by random small-scale vortices.  The project will be carried out through a combination of asymptotic expansion, rigorous analysis, and numerical computation.<br/><br/>Thermal convection, that is, heat driven fluid motion, is one of the most widespread and most important type of fluid motions in the universe.  Convection is a major feature of the dynamics of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the interiors of stars and planets.  It is also important in many industrial processes.  Nevertheless, the understanding of convection is fundamentally incomplete due to the extreme complexity of the problem.  Various simplifications are called for in order to make progress.  Here we consider situations that are of great importance in geophysical applications, and we derive and study simplified dynamics of heat convection.  The emergence of large-scale structures, such as the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, is a ubiquitous feature of geophysical fluid problems.  Understanding the mechanism of the emergence and persistence of such structures is one of the most intriguing issues in geophysical fluid dynamics.  Here we plan to study the emergence of large-scale structure in a randomly driven environment.  The expected successful completion of this project will enhance our understanding of these prototype fluid problems and provide insights into more complex fluid problems that we encounter in industrial manufacturing processes, as well as in the meteorology/climate models that are intimately related to the study of global environment change.

Provide participants with first hand accounts of the excitement of scientific discovery. The 2005 Fall GIFT workshop theme "" Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is organized by the AGU in partnership with the VGP section of the AGU. Travel support will only be available to teachers who are from outside the Bay area, i.e. more than 100 miles from the workshop site.

The PI is using CIRL extensively to organize the workshop and to advertise it to teachers. The GIFT workshop will also be beneficial for the presenters as it requires them to focus on the important recent discoveries, which will ultimately allow them to better and more succinctly formulate new research goals. Teachers with a positive belief in their ability to competently present knowledge and guide student learning, tend to select and effectively use instructional activities that involve learners in higher-order thinking skills, and deliver more inquiry-oriented lessons. The proposed activity expands the reach of AGU and encourages more teachers to become involved in AGU activities.<br/><br/>Teachers funded to attend the GIFT workshop will be placed in direct contact with active researchers, thereby shortening the time between discovery and classroom. Participants in the workshop have to be willing, on return to their school districts, to share the information with other district teachers, implement the GIFT workshop observations into the classroom and report on their improved teaching performances, based on the attendance to the workshop. The presenters at the workshop will share their presentations and they will be made available over the World Wide Web as well as on CD-ROM. Studies have shown that students of teachers that participate in these programs perform better in class and in tests, and are more enthusiastic about science.

In 2003 the United States, for example, had more than 57 percent more merchandise trade - imports plus exports - with Canada and Mexico than it did with all of the 15 members of the European Union combined. This was in spite of the fact that the combined GDP of the 15 EU countries was more than 6 times larger than that of Canada plus Mexico. The data show that business cycles in the United States are far more coordinated with business cycles in Canada and Mexico than they are with the business cycles in the European Union. The data also show that fluctuations in the U.S.- Canada real exchange rate and the U.S.-Mexico real exchange rate are more correlated with fluctuations in economic fundamentals than are fluctuations in U.S.-EU bilateral real exchange rates. This proposal lays out a plan for developing models to analyze how the cross-country characteristics of macro aggregates relate to the amount of trade between countries. The proposed research would investigate the implications of modeling the costs of setting up trade relationships in models of international business cycles and real exchange rate fluctuations. Specifically, this project would model firms as facing fixed costs of exporting specific goods to a specific country, for example, in setting up a distribution network in that country. <br/><br/>This project plans to use the models developed for analyzing international business cycles, real exchange rate fluctuations and the effects of international trade and investment policy on aggregate productivity. Models constructed in the early 1990s to analyze the economic impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) did a poor job of predicting the changes in trade patterns that actually occurred following this agreement. The proposed research would help us to develop better models for analyzing the impact of trade and foreign investment liberalization. The models are also intended to help us understand why financial crises produced by a sudden reversal of international capital flows result in severe economic crises. In both Mexico in 1994-1995 and in Argentina in 2001-2002, sudden stops produced severe crises and large drops in productivity. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Providing satisfactory answers to the sorts of questions posed in this proposal is essential for both policy analysis and for raising the level of political debate here and abroad. Currently, the United States is negotiating free trade agreements with a number of countries in Latin America. To build better models to analyze the potential impact of such agreements, economists need to understand why the models built to analyze NAFTA did so poorly. The work on exchange rate fluctuations within and across trade blocs will help produce models to analyze the increased macroeconomic interdependence that follows liberalization. It will also provide measures of the potential gains from increased future trade between the countries of NAFTA and the European Union. This work offers a potential explanation of why the recent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro has not resulted is a large change in trade flows between the United States and Europe. The work on modeling financial crises and trade and foreign investment policy will provide measures of the potential costs and benefits of liberalizing trade and foreign investment policy, especially in developing countries that liberalize their trade and foreign investment policies. It is essential that economists develop a better understanding of events in Mexico and Argentina over the past decade if they are to reassure policy makers and the members of the press and the public who are having second thoughts about such liberalization policies. <br/><br/><br/>"

Conventional microelectronic devices, such as microchips, use electric currents - the motion of electric charge as carried by electrons in metals and semiconductors - to control and manipulate information.  However, in addition to charge, electrons possess an attribute known as ""spin,"" which makes them tiny magnets, and it is the collective alignment of these spins in materials such as iron that leads to the phenomenon of magnetism.  Spin alignment in magnetic materials is the basis of information storage on hard disks and magnetic tapes.  In magnetoelectronics, dynamic control of electron spin allows one to transmit and manipulate information in new ways, and the first generation of ""spintronic"" devices--read heads for computer hard drives, have made possible the huge increase in information storage capacity in recent years and resulted in the explosive growth in computer-based technologies. Advances in this field require nanoscale control of materials properties and device architectures.  This MRSEC brings together scientists and engineers with wide-ranging and complementary expertise to carry out research in several extremely promising areas of nanostructured materials for magnetoelectronics:  (i) magnetic tunnel junctions that have potential for use in dynamic memory devices, (ii) the science of novel ring architectures for magnetoelectronic devices, (iii) organic semiconductor devices that have potential to expand magnetoelectronics into the rapidly developing field of low-cost, printable electronics, and (iv) nanostructures that will enable new approaches for the transport of spin information.<br/>The MRSEC's research activities will have far-reaching impact on a new generation of magnetoelectronics devices.  The Center will foster interactions with relevant industries to leverage the expected scientific advances to realize fully their technological potential.  As an integral part of its research program, the Center will provide interdisciplinary research training and education for post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduates, preparing them for careers at the cutting edge of science and engineering in industry, academia, and national laboratories.  The Center's education outreach programs will encourage young people to pursue scientific careers, provide continuing education and new curricular material for teachers, and introduce the public to the excitement and importance of materials research.  In all of these programs, the MRSEC will promote the participation of women and members of underrepresented groups.<br/>"

At the core of the proposed systems is the adaptive-feedback control of mathematical and computational models based on a posteriori estimates of errors in key quantities of interest, and modern Magnetic Resonance Temperature Imaging (MRTI) and diode laser devices to monitor treatment of tumors in laboratory animals. This approach enables an automated systematic model selection process based on acceptance criteria determined a priori and is valid for models of events occurring at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The proposed project should be of interest to both NIH/NLM and NSF. The methodologies to be implemented involve uncertainty quantification methods designed to provide an innovative, data-driven, patient-specific approach to effective cancer treatment. The general mathematical framework resulting from this research will be applicable to any thermo-therapeutic cancer treatment, but our treatment protocols will be established based on tumors seeded in prostates of canines. The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop treatment strategies by selecting optimal parameter sets (such as laser power, wave length, and fluence rate) based on high fidelity model predictions and data from cellular and in vivo biological measurement, and MRTI thermal distributions.<br/><br/>"

The framework is distinguished by four phases that are performed continually with dynamically-obtained data over the lifetime of the hazardous event. (1) Measurement: Distributed sensors provide dynamic measurements over a specified time horizon that will be used to reconstruct the initial conditions of the event. (2) Inversion: Driven by the sparse measurements, an inverse problem is solved to estimate the initial conditions for the equations governing the evolution of the hazard. (3) Prediction: Statistical analysis of the inversion results permits estimation of the uncertainty in the initial conditions, which is propagated into a prediction of the evolution of the hazard and its uncertainty. (4) Steering: Sensors are steered to new locations based on an effectivity index that incorporates sensitivities of the inversion with respect to sensor location, estimated uncertainty in the prediction, and population density factors.  Continual application of the measure-invert-predict-steer (MIPS) framework described above results in updated predictions of the evolving hazard with built-in uncertainty estimates, as well as revised sensor deployment strategies that refine the predictions to reduce their uncertainty. The methods developed consider two time scales of decision making at which the MIPS framework must execute. The seconds-to-minutes decision-making scale is required by first responders to begin immediate response efforts.  For such time scales, high-fidelity models in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) are too formidable.  Instead, the proposed methods will construct reduced-order models of the PDEs to facilitate realtime execution of the MIPS framework.  The minutes-to-hours decision-making scale permits more careful and measured response by emergency officials using high-fidelity, high-resolution PDE models.  To enable rapid execution of the MIPS cycle for such models, the project will develop fast, scalable, parallel algorithms for inversion and prediction.  To demonstrate, assess, harden, robustify, and the resulting framework, will be validated on a specific application testbed: prediction of the urban/regional dispersion of intentionally- or accidentally-released atmospheric contaminants from sparse measurements."

APG discharges have non-equilibrium thermal and chemical properties similar to classical low-pressure glow discharges, albeit under one-atmosphere and room-temperature conditions. Consequently, continuous processing of delicate/soft materials, particulate materials, and even materials in the liquid form are possible without need for expensive vacuum equipment. We have recently proposed a novel application of these discharges in the processing of biodegradable polymer microparticles. These polymer microparticles are used as vehicles for drug/vaccine delivery into the human body. An important step in the processing of these drug-laden particles is to activate them with a negative charge on their surface. Currently, this is achieved through a wet chemical processes that are inefficient, poorly reproducible, and engender undesirable liquid waste by-products. An APG plasma-based dry, efficient, and high-throughput process for the surface functionalization of bio-degradable polymer microparticles can address many of the problems with the wet-chemical processing approach. Here we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of using APG discharges for anionic surface activation of polymer microparticles. <br/><br/>This exploratory research will comprise the following activities: 1) we will develop a flexible, high-throughput APG plasma-based technique for the processing of biopolymer microparticles. 2) Reactive APG plasmas involving helium working gas and oxygen additives will be used to demonstrate the potential for negative charge activation of the microparticles. 3) Several detailed aspects of the APG plasma-particle processing technique will be explored by employing a host of plasma diagnostic and materials characterization techniques. Plasma diagnostics include electrical characterization by measuring discharge voltage-current waveforms, optical imaging, and optical emission spectroscopy. Materials characterization will be performed by measuring particle zeta potentials, scanning electron microscopy imaging, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for particle surface elemental analysis. <br/><br/>Two important areas of technical impact are envisioned: 1) APG plasma discharge technology will be impacted through realization of an important material processing application for this relatively new class of discharges. Although numerous applications have been proposed ranging from the deposition/etching of materials to plasma flow control, APG discharge technology is yet to witness a successful and widespread application in the industry. 2) The existing technology for the manufacture of biopolymer drug-delivery microparticles will be impacted by the replacement of a crucial ""wet chemistry-based"" process step with an environmentally benign ""dry"" plasma-based process. We hope that successful demonstration of this process will serve as a motivation for additional research into plasma-based dry replacement technologies for biomaterials manufacture (a field that is currently dominated by wet processing approaches). We anticipate that this exploratory research will serve as precursor to a more systematic, long-term fundamental study of the unique aspects of the APG plasma-biopolymer processing technique.<br/><br/>"

The compressive response of most foams is characterized by an elastic regime which terminates into a limit load followed by an extended load plateau. At the end of the load plateau the response hardens again. The load plateau is responsible for their excellent energy absorption.

It also established an informatics platform that disseminates nearly a terabyte of 3D CT datasets and derivative visualizations via the Web (DigiMorph.org) and as CD-ROM supplements to conventional publications. CIPRes and Morphbank provide a phyloinformatics platform into which the new 3D data will be integrated. The collective aim is to transform DigiMorph.org into a more<br/>robust resource that meets the rigorous demands of systematic biology. It will also deploy Magnetic Resonance Microscopy (MRM) to comparative soft tissue analysis in the various vertebrates that lack mineralization.<br/><br/>This proposal includes an improved Digimorph.org with significantly more content, improved search tools, and access to tools for manipulating and viewing data. This web site, averaging 30,000 visitors a month provides over 3000 movies and animations representing nearly 300 species of plants and animals. Organisms range from a 300 million year-old fossil tunicate only a few millimeters in diameter to an African lion, from a tulip flower to one of the earliest known dinosaur fossils. The Texas Memorial Museum, with over 100,000 K-12 visitors expected this year, has devoted a new exhibit to 3-D models and movies derived from Digimorph scans. This type of educational environment provides an unrivaled opportunity for introducing fundamental biological principals to an audience eager to ""see more."" This new digital pipeline from research to the public, via web sites and museums, speeds the dissemination of discovery and assures a novel impact for all visitors to Digimorph. The project will train graduate students and researchers in the mechanical and anatomical study of volumetric data. This will be a large step in extending the field of morphology from an analog to a digital environment, and the emergence of an informatics infrastructure exportable to other communities of engineers, physicians and biologists who use 3D data in their research.<br/>"

Deprotection will afford the free GPI and glycopeptides, while selective coupling prior to deprotection will afford the intact CD52. Solution structures of CD52 glycopeptides and antigens will be analyzed by NMR spectroscopy.<br/><br/>Professor Zhongwu Guo, of the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his synthetic and structural studies of sperm CD52 glycopeptides. Sperm CD52, which belongs to a special group of sugar-containing proteins that are anchored to cell membranes through molecules known as glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), plays a critical role in the human reproduction process. However, the difficulty to obtain pure forms of sperm CD52 has severely hindered further detailed studies about this important compound. This project aims at solving the problem through total synthesis and will advance chemistry by developing new synthetic methods for GPIs, glycopeptides and GPI-anchored glycopeptides. The efficient synthesis of these compounds, including specially labeled ones, will facilitate structural and biological studies. The structural analysis of synthetic CD52 glycopeptides and antigens will expand the knowledge regarding the impacts of GPIs on peptide structures, which combined with biological studies will help understand the structure-activity relationships of sperm CD52. The results may ultimately facilitate the understanding of the human reproduction process."

At the graduate level, under-representation among minority groups is even more striking than at the undergraduate level; for example, African Americans comprised just 8.5 percent of graduate school enrollments and Hispanics comprised just 5.2 percent of graduate school enrollments in 2000. The issue of under-representation may even be more important in California and Texas, which are the two largest states in the country in terms of population and two of the most racially and ethnically diverse states.  The goal of this collaboration - which includes the University of Texas at Austin, Stanford University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Southern California -is to help address the under-representation of Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans in graduate programs in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE) at the four institutions. Specific focus will be to increase the enrollment, retention, and successful completion of under-represented minority students in the SBE sciences at the participating institutions, with the long-term intent to increase representation among under-represented minority groups on university faculties in the SBE sciences. Two principles guide efforts.  Alliance partners will:  1) share ideas, best practices, and resources, and create a network to recruit and retain students for alliance universities; and 2)  build on successful initiatives that have already been developed on each of the campuses so that  efforts can be as cost-effective and successful as possible. <br/><br/>Highly collaborative and innovative methods will be used to improve efforts in recruiting and retaining minority graduate students at the institutions. Support NSF will be used to increase efforts in recruiting, retaining, and developing the careers of under-represented minority students. The Alliance plans to recruit cohorts of under-represented minority students on each campus, thus increasing minority graduate student enrollment in the SBE Sciences at each of our institutions, and to build on current efforts already ongoing at our universities and to build on the best practices that are already ongoing in the collaborative NSF-sponsored effort being undertaken by the three University of California schools<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>The program has the potential to influence the future of higher education in both California and Texas. The future of education in these two critical states in part depends on the ability of universities in these states (and elsewhere) to diversify the race/ethnic mix of faculty.

Grottoli and Pease will investigate the underlying mechanisms influencing coral recovery and mortality during bleaching by studying carbon acquisition, allocation and utilization of the coral host. During bleaching, when corals loose their symbiotic algae and their supply of photosynthetically fixed carbon is dramatically reduced or lost, they must rely on other sources of energy such as stored lipids and carbohydrates, or heterotrophically acquired carbon to sustain their energetic demands. If (1) corals are better able to acquire carbon by increasing heterotrophic feeding, they may be more likely to survive bleaching and fully recover. Alternatively, if (2) corals are able to store larger amounts of excess energy reserves during non-bleaching periods (e.g., as lipids), they may be able to sustain themselves by utilizing these reserves until fully recovered. If (3) corals are more efficient at utilizing these stored energy reserves, they may be more likely to recover from bleaching. All three of these strategies are hypothesized mechanisms used by corals to promote recovery following bleaching.   <br/><br/>In order to evaluate each mechanism, these investigators will perform a series of 13C-pulse labeling experiments designed to track the source of the fixed carbon, its allocation and storage within the host, and its utilization in bleached Montipora capitata and Porites compressa corals over the course of 14 months of recovery (relative to non-bleached controls). The experimental design allows for simultaneously measured variables to be comprehensively interpreted within the overall picture of the coral-algal symbiont-skeleton system relative to a control group.   <br/><br/>The results of this research will contribute to a better understanding in fundamental biology of coral bleaching by experimentally evaluating the physiological and biogeochemical responses of corals to temperature-induced bleaching stressors both during bleaching and recovery.  This work will build the framework for understanding the causes and consequences of bleaching on corals.  <br/><br/>This project involves the training of two PhD students (one with each collaborating investigator), a Postdoc, and two undergraduate students. Both investigators will incorporate research results from this project in their teaching and present the research in public lectures and through established K-12 outreach and teacher in-service training workshops. <br/>"

The MRI system will become housed in a research-dedicated MRI suite within the newly constructed Life Sciences Building at Brown, and it will form the core infrastructure for MRI-related research conducted by more than 100 faculty, research staff, and students in the Brown University community, including its College of Arts and Sciences and Medical School.  Researchers at Brown will use the NSF-fund MRI system primarily to investigate fundamentals of brain structure and function.  In addition to Brown users, researchers from other nearby institutions, such as the University of Rhode Island, Regina Saliva University, and University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth can have access to the 3 Tesla MRI system.  <br/><br/>Non-invasive imaging of the human brain has become a key research tool for life scientists interested in understanding brain mechanisms of sensation, perception, cognition, and voluntary movement.  MRI has becoming a cornerstone of such activities since it can provide structure and functional information at previously unobtainable brain locations without the need for invasive measures.  Structural MRI can provide sub-millimeter resolution of the cellular and fiber tract regions of the brain.  These capabilities now allow precise measurement of local brain volumes and visualization of the source and destination of major axon pathways.  Functional MRI can rapidly measure local changes in blood dynamics in volumes as small as 1 cubic mm.  Blood dynamics reflect changes in local neural activity, and its exploitation has become a key tool in exploring brain mechanisms of a variety of functions that constitute everyday experience.  The NSF funded resource will allow Brown researchers and those from nearby institutions to develop new strategies and knowledge about how the human brain mediates complex behavior.  <br/><br/>Projects currently planned for the 3 Tesla MRI system include research in systems and cognitive neuroscience and biomechanics. A major effort will be to enhance spatial and temporal resolution of structural and functional MR imaging, using special equipment of the new 3 Tesla MRI system.  In particular, the infrastructure will facilitate investigating specialization of the myriad brain areas that process visual stimuli, not only across the brain, but also within each area.  The new MRI system will allow non-invasive imaging of the input and output processing zones of cortical areas.  Several investigators will interrogate the functional MRI signals obtained during single instances of perceptual experience or voluntary movement to predict the conscious experience of the observer or to predict the performed movement(s).  While these 'mind-reading' efforts currently occur off-line, the team plans to implement them in real-time, and ultimately at high spatial resolution.  The addition of the 3 Tesla MRI resource at Brown will boost ongoing educational and research activities and will stimulate novel interactions between students, faculty and researchers working across life, social, physical and applied science disciplines.  The instrumentation will also be used in out-reach programs for under-represented minority high-school students participating in summer programs at Brown. <br/>"

The system is comprised of a multi-level hierarchical simulation of bat flight based on parameterized features of bat morphology and behavior. The simulation operates at multiple levels of physical approximation and computational speed, and is capable of very rapid solutions but requires input from measurements to ensure fidelity and optimality. This input will be provided in an integrated fashion, drawing from a parallel series of experiments in which several discrete data streams will be generated, including kinematic wing data, wake velocity data over a series of two dimensional cutting planes, as well as other data such as bone deformation, experimentally-determined material properties, etc. This data will direct the simulation ensuring accurate solutions, but still with high responsiveness. The data streams will be monitored, synthesized, combined and processed using an advanced immersive visualization environment which will be used to guide the interactions between the measurement and simulation and to organize the disparate streams of data. The simulation environment to be developed is the first such system capable of generating timely solutions of complex flows over highly unsteady and deformable structures. This has multiple scientific and engineering benefits ranging from the ability to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology to the design of bio-mimetic structures that draw from the abilities of bats on the wing. The direction provided by the experiment will guide scientists to the key sensitivities of these complex flying systems and provide insight to the complexities of animal flight mechanics. Lastly, the visualization systems will provide a unique tool for the synthesis and management of dynamic data drawn from a wide and disparate variety of data sources each having different qualities.<br/>"

The choice of technique is based on the idea that many recurrent circulation patterns exhibit coherent, organized behavior for some period of time.  The investigation will determine whether such an analysis can provide insights into what patterns are likely to occur and why, shed light on the nature of transitions between different atmospheric states, and help identify what type of model states should be most amenable to long-range prediction.  The approach will then be used to examine how such properties of the atmosphere react to changes in external forcing.<br/><br/>The two models that will be investigated are a barotropic model and a two-level quasigeostrophic model.  The first part of the project will involve experimenting with ways of successfully finding unstable periodic orbits in such models, building on studies of unstable periodic orbits that have been made in other fields.  Once found, the unstable periodic orbits will be compared with the aperiodic life-cycles of prominent circulation patterns such as the Pacific-North American pattern and the North Atlantic Oscillation.  The project will continue with an attempt to use an expansion in unstable periodic orbits to approximate the response operator that describes the sensitivity of the atmospheric model to small changes in external forcing.  The results will be compared with the approximate response operator derived from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.  Lastly, the predictability of states close to points on the least unstable periodic orbits will be examined with the intent of determining whether such states have anomalous predictability.<br/><br/>If successful, the work may help understand variations in predictability in long-range atmospheric forcing, and provide a better understanding of uncertainty in some types of long-range forecasts."

In particular, the National Design Repository of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) data for consumer and industrial products will be extended to enhance instruction and learning in freshmen-, sophomore-, junior-, and senior-level engineering design courses, including related issues with respect to accessing, storing, searching, and reusing CAD models and data.  The project will be implemented in seven undergraduate engineering design courses at the partner institutions, which include the Pennsylvania State University, the University of Missouri-Rolla, the University at Buffalo, and Drexel University.  The impact on the educational experience, learning, and practical knowledge of the undergraduate students who will interact with the National Design Repository through the resulting CIBER-U will also be assessed as part of the project.  <br/><br/>The results of this research will lead to a novel, multi-university educational experience that is mutually beneficial.  Specifically, the National Design Repository will be frequently populated, updated, and put to use while simultaneously helping advance systematic and coordinated methods to access, store, search, and reuse CAD models and data.  The research pairs two design repository developers with several active users and their students to realize a high-impact application of advanced cyber-infrastructure for allied engineering education.  The diversity and strength of the undergraduate engineering programs represented in the proposal will prepare a new generation of engineers to develop, exploit, and promote the use of digital design repositories to support product design.  These students will be exposed to tools and technologies that are representative of those that will shape the growth of the cyber-infrastructure and are currently preferred by companies in technology-intensive industries such as automotive and aerospace.  In two years, 1700+ undergraduate students will participate in CIBER-U, helping to prepare them to enter the workforce with a more effective understanding of working in a distributed, technology-mediated environment.

This marine impact occurred seaward of the western edge of an extensive, shallow-water carbonate platform bordering western North America, including the present area of eastern Nevada, western Utah, and southeastern California. This research will fill a fundamental gap in our knowledge of the onshore record of the Alamo Event and will serve to help develop a model for identifying and predicting the effects of continental-margin marine impacts, which include earthquakes, megatsunami, and impact-ejecta fallout, and their potential record in adjacent shallow-water and low-lying coastal areas. The main hypothesis to be tested by the research is that (a) widespread evidence of the Alamo Event is preserved in distal, onshore, inner carbonate-platform and peritidal settings surrounding the impact site; and (b) these isochronous, impact-related deposits can be distinguished from other types of superficially similar deposits by integrated biostratigraphic and event-stratigraphic correlation with proven Alamo Event deposits, by sedimentologic analysis, and by identification of diagnostic extraterrestrial impact indicators.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>This interdisciplinary study will focus on the relatively unstudied landward effects of continental-margin marine impact. The work will strive to provide important new data on the distal, onshore evidence of the Alamo impact, which will help to document the full magnitude of the event and will complement other studies on the proximal effects of the Event currently being conducted in south-central Nevada. Data generated by the study will serve not only to help recognize and model other ancient marine impacts, but also to help predict the possible environmental effects and hazards of future event-generated tsunami.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>The undergraduate research assistants will be chosen from a cohort of UNC earth science education students comprising a typically underrepresented group of secondary teaching and interdisciplinary study majors.

The participating countries are Turkey, Greece, Israel, Italy, Bulgaria, Rumania and the U.S. Academic chemical engineers from other Eastern Mediterranean countries will also be invited. The purpose of the Workshop is to update researchers from the participating countries with the state of the art of research in four areas of chemical engineering:  Advanced materials and nanotechnology, Chemical process engineering, Biological engineering, andnTransport phenomena and separation processes, in order to catalyze collaborative research and contacts between investigators from the various countries. These areas were selected since they are critical technology areas in all of the participating countries. The major theme of EMCC-4 will be ""Modes for Enhancing Collaborative Research"" in Chemical Engineering. <br/><br/>This is the fourth conference in this series. The three previous successful conferences were at the Technion, in Haifa, Israel in March 1999 with representatives from Turkey, Israel and the U.S.; in Ankara and Istanbul in May, 2001 with participation by chemical engineers from Greece as well as the other three countries; and in Thessaloniki, Greece in May 2003 with participation by the four participating countries.<br/><br/>Prof. Moti Herskowitz from Ben Gurion University in Israel will be the Chair of the Conference. Three distinguished U.S. chemical engineers will be Plenary Speakers including Prof. Nick Abbott of the University of Wisconsin. In addition, twenty five U.S. speakers will be invited from the four areas, a blend of senior researchers and promising young investigators. There will also be keynote lecturers from the U.S. in each research area. Distinguished invited speakers from the other countries have committed to participate and approximately 20 speakers from each country will be invited to give oral presentations. There will also be poster presentations from these countries, some presented by graduate students. Special travel supplements will also be provided to 5 U.S. participants to visit and lecture in countries other than Israel-Turkey, Greece, Italy, Bulgaria or Rumania -- to develop and/or promote collaboration. Other US participants are expected to attend the conference with approval from the organizers and with support from other financial sources.<br/><br/>The three previous EMCC Conferences have had major impacts in acquainting US, Turkish, Israeli and Greek academics with their research interests and capabilities and in fostering research collaborations.  The proposed fourth conference will provide further opportunities, especially with the many Israeli researchers expected to attend. In addition, by expanding the conference to include Italy, Bulgaria and Rumania we will further expand the opportunities for collaboration between the participating countries.  An added benefit of these conferences is the exposure they have provided for large numbers of graduate students from the Eastern Mediterranean countries to interact directly with both seasoned and young faculty researchers from the US and the other countries. In addition, these conferences have provided excellent forums for fruitful informal discussions on curriculum issues among faculty of the participating countries.<br/><br/>Draft reports summarizing the activities in each research area will be prepared at the meeting by the U.S. leaders in each research area with the help of their counterparts from the other three countries and will then be circulated for editing and to prepare the final report. This report will be posted on a general EMCC Web Site to be developed. In addition, it is expected that about 30 papers from the proposed Conference will be published in Chemical Engineering Communications, as was done for the previous conferences.<br/><br/>"

There is mounting evidence that liverworts (Phylum Marchantiophyta) were the first green plants to diversify on land some 500,000 million years ago and as such they are the oldest living lineage of terrestrial organisms.  This species-rich group of small green plants is remarkably diverse in structure, and includes extremely ancient relictual lineages as well as more recent radiations of closely related species. The antiquity of liverworts and the rich biodiversity at all taxonomic levels provide an unparalleled window into early land plant diversification. This collaborative effort brings together experts from around the world for a multidisciplinary, highly integrated approach that combines anatomical and developmental features with DNA sequence and genome structural characters to resolve phylogenetic relationships across the entire spectrum of liverwort diversity. Three general types of data will be compiled: 1) conservative morphological and genome characters to resolve deep ""backbone"" relationships, 2) anatomical/developmental data to resolve intermediate-depth lineages, and 3) morphological and DNA sequence characters to resolve relationships among a sample of 800 taxa representing all genera of liverworts.  A second major goal of the project is to integrate phylogenetic inferences and bionformatic efforts between this and other on-going NSF-supported projects, including several funded ATOL programs. These integrative activities include contributions to studies of genome structure and evolution across land plants, expansions of novel informatic tools to make methods, results, and implications widely accessible, and continued development of DNA sequence utilities that will benefit a broad range of scientists working on diverse organisms.<br/>        This project relies on the cooperation with and integration among research programs focused on resolving the green plant Tree Of Life. Integrative activities are substantive and consequential, and include expansions to phylogenetic databases and methodological/conceptual aspects of work toward resolving the Tree Of Life.  At least six post-doctoral associates and as many graduate students will be supported by the project, with substantial involvement of undergraduates as well. An effort to involve and retain individuals from underrepresented groups will be orchestrated through established federal programs that focus on such initiatives, including the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and the McNair Scholars Program. A solid mentoring infrastructure will be developed within each research team to provide support and professional experiences that ensure productivity and success of all participants. Outreach efforts include web presentations on the morphology and identification of liverworts for educators at all levels, development of web-based materials and a workshop targeting secondary school teachers, and increasing public awareness through weekend field excursions.<br/><br/>"

In the context of fluid flows, organisms widely adopt the strategy of beating cilia for self-propulsion and to move fluids for particulate transport and feeding.  For the engineering of integrated biochemical devices, solutions are needed for performing fluidic operations such as propulsion, mixing and separation. The investigators will pursue the creation and actuation of sheets of nanorods that serve as synthetic ciliated surfaces, and study their properties with a focus on fluid dynamics and applications in microfluidics. They will develop materials and processing to create controlled patterning of actuating cilia in sheets and within microfluidic systems. They will study the fluid dynamics generated by nanorods through a combination of sophisticated fluid modeling and nanoscale tracking of fluid motion. This project will develop both a new understanding of how biology moves fluids and how, in turn, we can engineer such structures for new compact analytical and medical technology applications. This program will create an educational microscopy and nanotechnology open lab that will allow middle and high school teachers remote access to the AFM to explore biological samples such as cilia and to explore magnetoelastomer compounds for engineered structures.<br/><br/>"

In order to accurately assess these processes, studies require accurate estimates of the air-water CO2 flux. Currently, these efforts are seriously undermined by an inability to satisfactorily model the factors governing air-water gas transfer in physically complex coastal systems.<br/><br/>In this study, researchers at the University of Columbia and Yale University will: (i) determine the spatial and temporal variability of turbulence that governs air-water CO2 exchange in coastal systems; (ii) measure the processes controlling the air-water CO2 exchange rate in river/estuarine systems, and resolve the relative importance that wind, tides, stratification, and bathymetry play in generating near surface turbulence in various estuarine systems; (iii) directly compare the gradient flux and the floating dome techniques; and (iv) determine the relative importance of the air-water CO2 flux versus other terms in the carbon budget in coastal systems.  Field experiments will be conducted in the Hudson River estuary (large tidal river system), the Parker River estuary (smaller macro-tidal river system), and the Long Island Sound (semi-enclosed coastal sea) to study systems with a range of biogeochemical and physical forcing. Measurements of air-water flux of CO2 using the gradient flux and floating dome techniques will be used to determine the gas transfer velocity in these systems. Simultaneously, turbulence at the water surface (e.g., turbulent kinetic energy dissipation) and physical forcing responsible for generating near surface turbulence (e.g., wind speed, tidal currents, stratification, bathymetry) will be quantified. The goal is to understand the processes controlling the CO2 flux in these three distinct coastal systems, so that the amount of CO2 exchange to the atmosphere in a wide range of other coastal systems and the ocean can be predicted.  Because this study relates directly to the cycles of any element with a gaseous phase, including many biogenic gases and industrial pollutants such as N2O, PCBs, Hg0 (g), and PAHs, the results from the project will reduce the large errors in gas exchange estimation.  This will allow the dominant pathways of harmful volatile pollutants to be assessed more carefully.  The project will provide support and training for graduate and undergraduate students, and include the participation of k-12 science teachers.  The results will be available to the public through a number of educational programs.   <br/>"

Clinker dominates the topographic form of many of the basins in which it is found, because it is more resistant to weathering than surrounding unaltered bedrock. It also preserves a record of the spatial-temporal patterns of fluvial incision, lateral backwasting, and plateau formation in these landscapes, because coal only burns when close to the surface, above the water table and ventilated with surface oxygen. Using (U-Th)/He ages of detrital zircons that are reset during clinker formation, we will map the patterns of coal burning and shallow exhumation in detail in several regions of the PRB in Wyoming and Montana, as well as characterize clinker ages over a broader scale throughout the basin. Model predictions of clinker age-patterns in individual drainages and across the landscape suggest that our results will be able to discriminate between at least some of these possible climatological or tectonic mechanisms driving landscape evolution.

In order to accomplish these objectives, three hypotheses will guide the research: 1) that the values embedded in computational models will partially, but not fully, correspond to those found in sociology and science and technology studies literatures, but additional values specific to computational models will also be identified; 2) that the ethical frameworks of the organization and the profession partially, but not fully, determine what values are embedded during the modeling process; and 3) that the embedding of values in computational models is a significant aspect of their development, and thus that the success or failure of a model as a product is partially, but not fully, determined by what values are embedded during the modeling process.  This project emerges at the intersection of the process of modeling and the ethics of modeling. These two threads are inseparably interlinked, since professional and organizational ethics play a role in shaping the process of modeling, while an understanding of the process of modeling is necessary in order to understand how values become embedded in computational models.  To test these hypotheses and achieve these objectives, it is necessary to employ a multiple-methodology approach to data collection and analysis. At the selected field site, a computational modeling laboratory, the researchers will utilize structured questionnaires, interviews, participant observation, and focus groups to study the process of computational modeling.  Data analysis will be both quantitative and qualitative, and will be based on statistical methodologies, behavioral analysis, and content analysis. The purposes of this exploratory study are to demonstrate the validity of the proposed methodology by conducting all four data collection approaches with corresponding data analyses for one field site, while at the same time producing valuable data about the ethical implications of values embedded in computational models.  This project builds on the experience and strengths of both researchers, including prior NSF-sponsored research. One of the PIs has forty years of experience as a computational modeler, including research on the ethics of modeling, while the other PI has an educational background in computer science, anthropology, and science and technology studies. This study, first, aims to contribute to the literature on the ethics of modeling by providing an in-depth case study of the ethics and values of computational modeling. Second, the methodology for conducting in-depth field data collection and analysis will contribute to the literature on professional and organizational culture and ethics. Finally, the study will also contribute by bringing together the literatures on models as products and modeling as a process, which can lead to a better understanding of the effect that embedding specific values during the process of computational modeling can have on the success of the computational model as a product.   The first social contribution of this study will be to improve the practice of computational modeling by demonstrating to modelers how values are embedded in the models that they produce and the ethical implications of these embedded values. A second social contribution of this study will be to make modelers more aware of the constraints of their organizational cultures. Finally, the findings of this and subsequent research can eventually lead to the development of online modules for educating computer science students in the ethics of modeling, which would provide computer science programs with a free resource that they could use to develop ethics courses."

This is a major cause of earthquake damage with costs in the billions of dollars.  A large knowledge gap has been identified in current engineering methods to evaluate bending response of pile foundations to the lateral loading applied by the liquefied sand (limit equilibrium (LE) and p-y methods).  One source of uncertainty is the area over which the lateral pressure must be applied for pile groups, the sum of the areas of the piles alone, or also soil between the piles.  The difference between these two assumptions can produce pile-bending moments varying by a factor of three.  Another source of uncertainty is the importance of soil permeability, not included in current LE methods, but which full scale and centrifuge shaking tests indicate can produce a variation of bending moments by a factor of seven.  Centrifuge and full-scale shaking table tests, as well as insitu testing and preliminary analyses, suggest a complicated response of the liquefied sand in the neighborhood of individual piles and pile groups.  Included is stiffening of the liquefied soil due to excess negative pore water pressures caused by soil-pile interaction; water flowing from the free field with eventual expansion; and, softening of the liquefied soil near the foundation, in a complicated time-dependent manner. <br/><br/>A fundamental and comprehensive approach, made possible by NEES, will be used to tackle the problem using a range of available experimental and analytical tools. The objectives of the research are to understand the phenomenon of sand liquefaction during lateral spreading near pile foundations; to solve the engineering questions of how to design pile foundations against lateral spreading both in simplified terms as well as in terms of providing a basic understanding for appropriate analytical platforms; and, to clarify the correct way to use centrifuge modeling in future research and engineering applications.  This is done through an experimental research plan using the University at Buffalo 1g 2D shaking, 6m-tall laminar box container NEES facility and the RPI NEES centrifuge facility, including use of novel advanced sensors to measure soil accelerations, deformations and pressures during shaking; and micromechanical Discrete Element (DEM) numerical experiments and finite element (FE) analyses at RPI, UC San Diego and Tulane University; all integrated by an appropriate identification and analysis framework including system identification and visualization capabilities.  The DEM numerical experiments, validated by the 1g and centrifuge physical tests, aim at providing for the first time detailed information at the level of individual soil grains and groups of grains, on the response of the liquefied soil close to pile foundations including strain localization, shear banding and flow around the piles, calculated from basic micromechanical principles.  The DEM insights will be used to refine important unsolved aspects of the constitutive relations used in the FE analyses.  A Year 3 Workshop with the participation of a broad range of engineers and researchers from the US, Japan (including Japanese collaborators) and other countries, will evaluate the results of the research. <br/><br/>The project will exercise a new set of research tools and ways to integrate them. The Interactive Web Site of the project will be periodically updated with results and interpretations. Graduate and undergraduate involvement in research, with emphasis on the recruitment of under-represented students, term projects in capstone and similar courses, preparation of 1-2 Educational Modules at the end of the project, and specific efforts toward K-12 students and their teachers, are aimed at intensifying the impact of the project.<br/>"

US.<br/><br/>PI:  Van Dessel Steven<br/>Co-PI:  Achille Messac <br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>In this project, the investigators and their team are studying thin-film Active Building Envelope technologies. Active Building Envelopes (ABE) constitute a novel enclosure technology that integrates photovoltaic and thermoelectric materials. In thin-film ABE systems, a thin-film photovoltaic system is used to power a thin-film thermoelectric system, and both systems are fully integrated into one thin-film surface. When exposed to solar radiation, thin-film ABE systems have the ability to control the magnitude and direction of heat flow across their surface. Such intelligent control is accomplished by controlling the direction of electrical current applied to the thin-film thermoelectric system. This control feature allows for the development of a new class of materials for which the thermal conductivity is no longer determined by the thickness of a material only. Thin-film ABE technologies constitute a new and critical frontier in the area of intelligent heat transfer materials. Promising applications include the development of very thin and transparent thermal coating systems that can be applied to various enclosure materials, such as glazing. <br/><br/>In thin-film ABE systems, solar energy is used directly to control the direction and magnitude of heat transfer across a material. For example, when applied to a glazing system for use in windows, the internal surface of the glass can become cold during the summer and warm during the winter.  Hence, the glass itself will have the ability to control the indoor temperature, making conventional air conditioning equipment obsolete. Furthermore, as thin-film ABE technologies are based on solid state materials, they are completely silent and virtually maintenance free.  Other promising applications include the development of advanced thermal control system for use in future space missions, and use in advanced packaging materials that require thermal control.   An important incentive for developing thin-film ABE systems is that this technology operates entirely on solar energy. Therefore, when used in building applications to control indoor temperature, significant energy savings can be accomplished. This becomes especially relevant considering that a significant portion of the US domestic energy use is used for space conditioning. The successful development of thin-film ABE technology can therefore offer substantial environmental, economic, and strategic benefits to the US.  In conjunction with recent advances in the area of nano-technology, and bio-technology, this research will also open the theoretical path towards the development of future ABE systems that operate at the scale of molecules. <br/>"

They also have tremendous conservation value, housing the world's remaining large grazing animals, particularly in Africa. A fundamental understanding of the factors most important for sustaining savanna grasslands, fire and grazing, is required for their management and conservation. Yet scientists have questioned whether grasslands in different regions function similarly. Convergence in function would mean that ecological understanding and conservation strategies could be generalized worldwide. But contingent factors specific to a region, such as differences in history or the types of grazers present may lead to unique responses in some savanna grasslands. The goal of this research is to compare key ecological processes to fire and grazing in savanna grasslands in North America and South Africa. Scientists will take advantage of three ongoing long-term experiments that manipulate these key factors and compare responses in productivity, biodiversity, and nutrient cycling. <br/><br/>As humans alter fire and grazing regimes worldwide, comparative research elucidating the consequences is needed to develop management strategies that can insure the sustainability of savanna grasslands. This research will provide the basic knowledge necessary to do so, and will afford training and important global and cultural experiences for young scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students.<br/>"

The main goals of this thematic Center are to broaden understanding of the oceans in the context of the earth and solar systems and to help the COSEE network reach rural and inland audiences.  The PIs will pioneer a system of interfaces, tools, and resources to reach underserved and underrepresented groups, and to bring ocean sciences to inland audiences by presenting it in the context of more familiar components of the earth system, including environmental and space sciences.  One goal is to explore the effectiveness of expanding knowledge of the ocean's role beyond being a driver of earth's climate to placing the earth in the context of its unique place in the solar system.  Activities include building and training educator-scientist teams to work towards specific goals, e.g., testing strategies for effective use of ocean data, training in the use of concept mapping, and the identification and evaluation of high-quality resources.  Evaluation of products, models and information is integrated throughout, with continuous self-assessment.  Formal education partners at the University of Maine and University of New Hampshire will test the efficacy of materials with educators whose knowledge of ocean-related content ranges from novice to expert.  Maine will be a test bed for the COSEE network to start reaching inland rural populations.  The team includes scientists and educators with expertise in the hydrosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, and atmosphere.  The team will develop concept maps and case studies that show application of ocean topics to the National Science Education Standards.          <br/>The Center will develop a formal mechanism for scientific review of materials to ensure the products they recommend are of the highest quality and meet rigorous standards, as well as to provide feedback from educators and scientists to product developers.  They will select resources from DLESE, the BRIDGE, NOAA and others and evaluate these for classroom readiness and scientific accuracy using their team of well-trained resource evaluators with first-hand knowledge of earth systems science.  They also will do a ""gap analysis"" of missing resources.   The ""Gap Analysis"" will also inform the science community about avoiding developing materials for well-covered topics.  The review process developed by COSEE-OESS, from initial use of NASA's education product review, will be disseminated nationally as a model for evaluating best practices and assessment and evaluation guidelines for education materials.<br/>    In-service teacher programs will focus on expansion of University of New Hampshire's Coastal Observing Center summer in-service teacher workshops to incorporate OESS content and evaluation of activities (""test bed"" for novel materials and activities).  These workshops have annual themes focusing on ocean observing systems and the integration of buoy, shipboard, and satellite data (GoMOOS).  Pre-service teachers and general science students at the University of Maine will take a new course created by OESS to learn ocean research methods by focusing on using physical principles, concepts and approaches to explain phenomena in aquatic sciences that are aligned to the NSES.  The course will be developed for distribution to teachers after rigorous evaluation.<br/>   <br/>Intellectual Merit of the Center:  This thematic center focuses on creating and evaluating a series of interconnected tools and techniques designed to broaden understanding of the ocean in the context of the earth and solar systems.  Results will be translated into innovative multimedia products that showcase the ocean in the earth-sun system.  Educational resources will be evaluated for science and education impact, and gaps in these resources will be identified and filled.  A new undergraduate course to teach about ocean phenomena will be developed, tested, and disseminated nationally.  The proposed Center will help COSEE reach inland and rural audiences.  <br/>    <br/>Broader impact:  This Center will serve as a ""learning organization"" to deliver excellent products, models, and information that can be applied virtually anywhere.  The final products, publication of ""Best Practices"" (a document that describes the value of system context in terms of learning) and ""Strategies to reach inland audiences"" will be disseminated throughout and beyond the COSEE network.  <br/> <br/>"

The algorithms have been applied to problems that are known to be at the edge of what is computationally feasible and problems of established practical value, such as the design of good error correction codes, solutions to hard combinatorial optimization problems, and the development of decentralized estimation techniques.<br/><br/>All the algorithms can be viewed as forms of message passing: an optimization problem involving many variables is solved by an iterative procedure where the results of calculations involving small subsets of variables become the inputs for subsequent calculations at neighboring sets of variables. Mathematically, the algorithms can be represented by a flow of messages between a large collection of interconnected sites. The mathematical challenge is to understand cases where messages can flow around a big loop, so that a site receives incoming messages derived from messages sent from the same site at earlier stages of the calculation. There is a potential for misleading feedback.<br/><br/>The PIs have already demonstrated that some message-passing problems can be transformed mathematically into problems where tools from statistical physics can be applied. In particular, they have shown that the feedback problem is related to the phenomenon of phase transition in physical systems composed of enormous numbers of interacting particles. The project will build on this insight, drawing ideas from statistics, computer science, engineering, and statistical physics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Development of such a technique is important because in order to optimize the properties of SWNT/polymer composites, the SWNTs must be separated from the bundles.  The approach to meeting this critical goal is to use supercritical CO2 assisted twin-screw extrusion to achieve separation and dispersion of SWNTs.  In order to achieve wetting between the supercritical fluid and the SWNTs, the surface of the SWNT bundles will be chemically altered such that the supercritical fluid will preferentially migrate to the surface of the SWNT bundles.  Upon exiting the extruder/pressure chamber, the supercritical fluid will expand, as it becomes gas.<br/><br/>If successful, the processing method will promote the use of SWNTs and thus increase demand that is necessary to reduce the price.  The process will allow the production of commercial scale quantities and broader scale testing of composite properties.  In addition, this is a solvent free process that is environmentally friendly.  This project will also contribute to the fundamental understanding of the thermodynamics of CO2 solubility in heterogeneous systems, as well as our understanding of the role of aspect ratio and surface area in controlling nanocomposite properties.  Finally, the understanding gained through the analysis of surface modification (interface), miscibility and solubility, and processing conditions will increase our ability to control and create future materials.  As we address the challenge of a commercial scale process that achieves excellent dispersion in a manner that is inexpensive and environmentally friendly, one of the broader societal impacts will be to improve the properties of potential products and enable the manufacture of new products containing SWNTs.<br/>"

Recently, economists and anthropologists have started to use laboratory experiments in the field to measure preferences and decisions under stylized situations. Though valuable, these studies rarely assess whether results from experiments predict practices. This study uses experiments to measure individuals' patience (personal time preference), and assess whether experimental measures correlate with actual behavior. Establishing a link between experimental assessments of human behavior and observed practice would empirically reinforce the usefulness of such experiments, that are often more flexible and less expensive to undertake than are observational studies. The project will assess self-perceptions of individual patience and the influence patience has over behavior; experimentally estimate the patience of men and women in four rural areas in Gabon; experimentally identify ""hyperbolic"" individuals, those who exhibit time preference reversals, specifically exhibiting higher levels of patience for future tradeoffs than for current tradeoffs; and correlate the measures of patience from the experiment with participant's observed savings, investments in schooling, health, and children, use of natural resources, and alcohol use over three years. The project studies rural communities in Gabon because: a) nearly all studies of patience among humans come from mainstream populations of industrial societies and b) the researchers will be able to compare results of this research with a parallel study using the same methods that will be added, at no additional cost, to ongoing work among Tsimane' Amerindians in Bolivia. The researchers include a human ecologist, a cultural anthropologist, a psychologist, and an experimental and development economist who will work in Gabon during 3 years. This research will develop and test new methods for assessing patience and its influence on behavior that combine insights from psychology, economics, and ecology; will add to our understanding of the role of education, health, age, gender, income, wealth, and land tenure security in determining personal time preference; will obtain more accurate estimates of the causes and consequences of patience than are possible with the more common cross-sectional approach because it will obtain repeated measures of patience from the same subjects; will contribute to the debate about the role of time preference in savings, investment in schooling, health and children, drug abuse, crime and natural resource use; will provide the first detailed ethnographic account of the factors that influence patience and the role of patience in mediating savings, investment in schooling and health, drug abuse, crime and natural resource use; and will include the broader impact of training a number of US Ph.D. students in anthropology in multi-disciplinary experimental and observational methods of field enquiry."

Fast, reliable, and intelligent communication networks are required to improve performance and functionality. Future sensing systems will integrate physical characteristics of sensors, communications, and software to achieve the best possible performance. No matter what type of material or technology is used, sensors will certainly have physical limitations in terms of accuracy, resolution, lifetime, etc. Through the joint design of hardware and software components of a sensing system, it is possible to overcome these limitations.  The focus of this research will be on novel image sensing systems with integrated icroactuators.  There is an increasing demand for high-resolution, high-dynamic-range, and low-noise images not only to give the viewer a high-quality picture but also to provide additional detail that may be critical in various applications. Digital cameras, surveillance systems, medical imaging, aerial/satellite imaging, scanning/printing devices, and high-de.nition TV systems are some of the application areas where high-quality images are desired.  Here, we propose a microactuator-based image sensing system to produce high-dynamic-range and high-resolution images. We propose to design a system where image sensor is jittered by embedded microactuators. The jitter amounts are predetermined and controlled; and several images are captured during the whole process. These images are then processed to produce a higherresolution<br/>and higher-dynamic-range image. The main contributions of the proposed research are<br/>as follows:  To design a sensor system demonstrating the possibility that physical limitations can be exceeded by integrating hardware and software components  To have a more realistic model of the imaging process to be used in inverse problems in image processing and computer vision applications<br/> To develop image reconstruction methods that can handle potential changes in illumination conditions<br/>and camera settings  To analyze spectral correlation in color images and to investigate ways of exploiting it in image processing applications                                                                                                                  Broader Impact: The proposed research will have important impact on surveillance and security applications, scienti.c and commercial products, and health industry. Companies that produce image-related products, such as digital cameras, camcorders, high-de.nition TV, biomedical imaging devices, microscale imaging devices may greatly utilize from the proposed research.  The problem of high-resolution and high-dynamic range image reconstruction is also expected to have even broader implications in information fusion and information theory. It is closely related to the information content and the compressibility of video data.<br/>The cross-disciplinary nature of the project will open up new research directions. Although this<br/>is the primary impact, the proposal will have an educational impact as well. The results of this<br/>research will enhance the content of several courses (e.g., Introduction to Computer Vision, Image<br/>Analysis I, Image Analysis II, and Integrated Sensors and Actuators courses that are o.ered by the<br/>PI and the co-PI at LSU.) As part of this research, the PIs plan to create a variety of independent<br/>projects in which undergraduates can enroll and perform research for academic credit. For doctoral<br/>students the major educational component is the dissertation research itself. The research problems<br/>will require that the students become experts in more than one areas, including signal, image, and<br/>video processing, pattern recognition, information theory, optimization, real-time implementations,<br/>and hardware design/manufacture. All of this will be done in the context of well-posed problems<br/>that have practical applications and each will lead to a Ph.D. thesis."

The team will develop algorithms for adaptive data collection during a field experiment,<br/>post-experiment data analysis for modeling behavior, and control of <br/>the movement of the group using the learned models in  field experiments<br/>and environmnet data from satellite imagery. The main motivation and <br/>application of this work is  in the area of free-ranging animal ecology. Groups of animals such as herds are complex self-organized systems that are affected <br/>by many factors including age, group size, landscape topography, plant <br/>phenology, weather, and the environment.<br/><br/>This project combines the most recent advances in computer networking, modeling, and robot motion planning and control. The team will collect physical data for extensive periods of time in the field to define behavior models  for herds of animals, using these models to develop planning and control algorithms for coordinating the location of these herds, and using the location control system to manage the stock density and optimize the use of land. This includes: (1) tracking the motion and activities of individual animals; (2) identifying natural group formation and behavior; (3) planning and controlling the location<br/>of individuals and groups; (4) managing the density of the group; and (5) using animal groups as networked information backbones. Although the models will be grounded in specific field data, the proposed methodology and resulting algorithms will be applicable to other societies of free-ranging animals and synthetic societies of agents.<br/><br/>This work will bring together computer science, robotics, and animal<br/>experts in a project that rests on the synergy between these domains.<br/>The work will be grounded on real data and the resulting models<br/>and algorithms will be used to define detailed plans for field experiments.<br/>The models will lead to a better understanding of animal behavior and <br/>control at the individual and group level, which has the potential to <br/>impact broadly agriculture and the environment.

Undergraduate students are routinely assessed for their science content knowledge. A complementary component of our national effort to improve science education is the ability to effectively assess teachers' pedagogical knowledge of inquiry science teaching.  Currently, such an assessment tool is not available. This project is developing a field-validated, objective assessment tool for testing undergraduate pre-service elementary teachers' pedagogical knowledge of inquiry science teaching (POSIT, the Pedagogy of Science Inquiry Teaching test). The assessment items can be used both in summative evaluation and as a formative tool in undergraduate instruction. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit. <br/>The U.S. Department of Education has recently called for educational revisions to be informed by research and scientifically based evidence. This project helps to meet that standard.  It involves a careful plan for test development followed by two rounds of piloting and revision, concluding with a blinded field-test classroom observation component for studying the validity of POSIT. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its coherent combination of innovative and research-based features in its design -- a design that includes features of authenticity, problem-based learning, epistemology, exemplification, methodology, and summative and formative functions.  The project is focused with a clear goal - one that serves a national need as articulated by NSF, the National Research Council and the AAAS. This project is also interdisciplinary. Participating are ten universities, several geographically and demographically diverse public school districts, and a national panel of experts. The final instrument will conform to The Student Evaluation Standards and the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing <br/><br/>Broader impact. <br/>The ""gold standard"" for pedagogy assessment is what teachers actually do in the classroom. POSIT is being blind-tested against such a standard. Once it has been developed and validated against the criteria by observation of classroom practice, educators at any undergraduate institution could use it to evaluate and improve science teacher education programs. Improving the preparation and quality of teacher graduates will help ameliorate inequalities in schools that serve underrepresented populations, by increasing the number of teachers well qualified to teach science. POSIT will also be of value to researchers in science education seeking to improve the education and practice of science teachers. Professors teaching undergraduate and graduate SMET courses may find POSIT useful. Previous research indicates that science professors can be motivated to improve their own teaching practice as a consequence of considering how science is best taught to young people. <br/><br/>Project Goals<br/>1) Develop criteria for items reflecting the pedagogy of inquiry to guide item development and evaluation. 2) Compose, pilot, and revise a set of problem-based objective items for K-8 science curricula, based on realistic teaching vignettes of elementary science teaching, and meeting inquiry item criteria. 3) Pilot the test items with undergraduate, pre-service teachers reflecting racial and gender diversity. 4) Establish standardized scoring and test administration directions. 5) Establish initial estimates of reliability. 6) Validate the instrument by studying its predictive power with respect to actual teacher practice of inquiry teaching in classrooms. 7) Disseminate assessment items and project reports via the Internet, conference presentations, and journal articles."

Because cnidarians diverged from the rest of the animals prior to the evolution of organs, their overall anatomy is quite simple. Despite this however, cnidarians have attained incredible diversity, comprising over 11,000 species, many of which display elaborate structures and complex life histories. The lack of organs and other anatomical landmarks has made it difficult for scientists to discern their evolutionary relationships. Recent technological and theoretical advances in the sequencing and analysis of DNA provide the opportunity to use the information encoded within an organism's genetic code to elucidate evolutionary relationships. The primary aim of this proposal is to obtain DNA sequence data from 1,800 cnidarian species: this will generate approximately 23 million base pairs of cnidarian DNA sequence, and the specimens from which the sequences are obtained will be retained in natural history museum collections. The information encoded in the DNA will be used to reconstruct cnidarian phylogenies (evolutionary trees), using computer algorithms and supercomputing facilities. Some of the questions this proposal will address are: Was the ancestor to all of cnidarians solitary or colonial? Are jellyfish or hydras more closely related to the corals? How and when did coral skeletons evolve? What are the evolutionary transitions between a simple hydra polyp and a complex Portuguese Man-of-War colony? Reconstructing a cnidarian evolutionary tree is important for our understanding of the patterns and processes that accompanied the early diversification of animal life. <br/><br/><br/><br/>        Formal and informal education will result from this research. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars, including those belonging to groups under-represented in the sciences, will be trained. A symposium on cnidarian evolutionary relationships will be organized by the investigators at a national scientific meeting. A Cnidaria Tree of Life database will be developed to include outreach and learning components such as images, common names, and keys designed to appeal to students at all levels as well as interested users such as divers and aquarists. Museum exhibits will be created based on research results, one at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum, and one, entitled ""Cnidarian Diversity in the Oceans"" that will be part of the new Oceans Hall, due to open at the National Museum of Natural History in 2008. A website and classroom poster (in both English and Spanish) integrated with the latter exhibit will be created in collaboration with a K-12 educator supported through NSF's Research Experience for Teachers program. <br/><br/><br/>"

These two parameters are difficult to predict in large part because biological effects fundamentally impact them over short temporal and spatial scales, and the physical and biological effects rapidly feedback on each other. This study proposes to place real-time remote observing platforms at locations of contrasting benthic physical disturbance that are characterized by strong gradients in benthic ecology, seabed characteristics and suspended particle properties. A combination of acoustic and video imaging of the seabed and lower water column will, in real time, identify changes in biologic activity, deposition, erosion, suspended sediment properties and/or bedform evolution that, in turn, trigger or otherwise indicate changes in bed erodability. Rapid response cruises employing real-time shipboard surveys will track events, directly measuring the short time-scale evolution of erodability, key physical and geochemical properties, and biological activity and assemblages. Open source numerical modeling of bed evolution, erosion and deposition, and water column processes will be coupled to the observing effort and will fundamentally advance predictability of fine sediment transport. The proposed study area, which leverages significant real-time observing efforts underway in the York River estuary and Lower Chesapeake Bay, has key properties in common with energetic, high sediment load shelves around the world which play essential roles in the global sediment and carbon cycles. In such systems, the nature of benthic biological activity, suspended particle properties and associated biological-physical feedbacks are tied to evolving salinity fronts and spatial and temporal gradients in physical disturbance. This is also commonly the case along major estuaries in the US and worldwide. Regardless of the locale, prediction of fine sediment transport relies critically on understanding controls on bed erodability and particle settling. This proposal hypothesizes that the evolution of bed erodability and suspended aggregates of fine sediment is distinctly different under biologically vs. physically dominated conditions. This proposal predicts that with increased biological activity, bed erodability will be greater and decrease less strongly with depth, but suspended aggregates will be larger and stronger due to small-scale biological binding. Under physically dominated conditions, erodability will increase suddenly with deposition, but decrease more quickly with time and depth due to rapid consolidation. Under physical dominance, suspended aggregates/flocs will be smaller and weaker, have smaller fall velocities, and decrease in size with increased stress due to breakup by shear.<br/>"

The findings indicate that advection of EDW injects a wedge of low nutrient water beneath the seasonal thermocline in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. Furthermore, the presence of the nutrient-depleted water mass may dampen the biological response to vertical processes that flux nutrients upwards throughout the subtropical gyre. This raises important questions regarding how and when the EDW is depleted in nutrients and how the signal is exported to the rest of the subtropical gyre: 1) What are the time scales associated with the biological depletion of inorganic nutrients during water mass formation? 2) What is the nutrient concentration of the EDW upon subduction? and 3) How does the formation of EDW impact the downstream nutrient reservoir and vertical nutrient fluxes? <br/><br/>In this project, researchers at Duke University will address these questions with nutrient measurements in the formation region of the EDW. Fortuitously, an NSF-funded field program, CLIvar MOde water Dynamics Experiment (CLIMODE), is currently ramping up for a comprehensive analysis of the formation, maintenance and destruction of EDW. Though CLIMODE's observational program is comprised of a suite of measurements, it currently lacks any biogeochemical component. This project will provide for the addition of nutrient sampling to the CLIMODE observational program in order to test hypotheses concerning the impact of EDW on the subsurface nutrient reservoir. Specifically, the investigators will add nutrient analyses to the planned hydrographic surveys and will mount a nitrate sensor on each of two CLIMODE moorings. The former will create the first cross-section of nutrients during the winter in the formation region, and the latter will provide an unprecedented time series of nitrate within the subtropical gyre.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this proposed work is to further the understanding of the degree to which the horizontal advection of a subtropical mode water impacts the subsurface nutrient reservoir and the corresponding availability of nutrients to primary producers. Such an understanding is crucial since the subtropical gyre's role as a carbon sink depends on the availability of nutrients to fuel the biological pump, remove organic carbon from the surface ocean, and maintain a favorable air-sea gradient in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide necessary for the solubility pump. Furthermore, since water mass production is known to vary on interannual and decadal time scales, establishing the link between subtropical mode waters and nutrient availability advances our understanding of how primary productivity is impacted by climatic variability. <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, it is clear that an improved understanding of how the subsurface nutrient reservoir is replenished and diminished will aid the understanding of how the ocean acts as a carbon sink.  The project will also support the research of a pre-doctoral graduate student.<br/>"

Data from over 40,000 U.S. employees of a single organization allows examination of demographic combinations of staff across units, including large numbers of Whites, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Americans. This research offers a unique opportunity to examine each of these groups in workplaces where they numerically dominate and are in the minority. Dr. Offermann will compare the effects of different supervisor/subordinate racial, ethnic, or gender combinations on individual and organizational outcomes using attitude data, retention and turnover data, organizational performance, and management evaluations. The key hypothesis is that identification with a superordinate social category (the organization) can reduce the effects of demographic differences. Two of the primary methods will be to measure and compare diversity within and across organizational units, and to conduct qualitative examinations of more and less successful diverse workplaces.  These methods are aimed at understanding the factors involved in creating successfully inclusive workplaces.  Using multiple years of data, longitudinal analyses will help to determine whether increasing staff diversification over time or prolonged exposure to working in diverse units affects responses. <br/><br/>The results of this research will contribute significantly to knowledge of intergroup relations, and advance knowledge of the effects of diversity in multiracial, multiethnic work settings. Implications for the successful integration of diverse individuals into positions of equal employment opportunity can help to improve work relationships and organizational performance, as well as result in increased opportunities for all Americans, independent of background.<br/>"

It offers an unprecedented opportunity to collect perishable data that will assist emergency planners and bridge officials in facing similar disasters in the future. The American Association for Wind Engineering (AAWE) is coordinating a documentation effort from research institutions with wind- and surge-related expertise across the United States in an effort to collect perishable data by acknowledged experts. Currently teams from Louisiana, Texas, Florida, South Carolina, Colorado, Iowa and New York are participating in this AAWE coordinated effort. This award supports the data collection effort conducted by a team of faculty and graduate students from Louisiana State University (LSU). The focus of LSU's effort will be on two of the most catastrophic and unique aspects of this storm: (1) the terrible loss of life due to storm surge, and (2) the damage and destruction of numerous short- and medium-span bridges due to surge and waves.  The first task concerns collection of perishable data about flood casualties.  Previous research has documented a strong relationship between fatality rates and depth of flooding, but the effects of other variables are less well understood.  Detailed data will be collected about the conditions surrounding fatalities, including: (1) location (GPS coordinates); (2) depth of water; (3) where the fatality occurred, e.g., building, car, in open space; (4) building type, elevation, number of stories, and damage sustained (if fatality occurred in a building); and (5) demographic data.  The collected data is vital to flood fatality model development and validation.  Such models are valuable to emergency managers and disaster public health officials to aid in disaster planning, design of mitigation measures, search and rescue operations, and recovery operations.<br/>The second task in this award will be concerned with collecting bridge damage data. It will focus on short- and medium-span bridges that have performed poorly during Hurricane Katrina and last year during Hurricane Ivan. Many unanchored, or poorly anchored, simply supported spans were lost due to unseating. These failures will be surveyed to collect data on: (1) failure modes (e.g., anchor failure, pile-to-cap connection, pile failure, other modes); (2) scour; (3) corrosion; (4) high water mark elevations; and (5) bridge railing type (solid/open). The collected bridge data will be used to develop design solutions for new construction of coastal bridges and rehabilitation of existing coastal bridges to avoid the occurrence of similar tragedies.  Collected data from both tasks will be assembled into a report along with results from other AAWE partner investigations, which will be the subject of a one-day workshop held in Washington, DC, with financial and administrative support from the American Society of Civil Engineers' Structural Engineering Institute.  This forum will transfer critical knowledge on infrastructure performance during Hurricane Katrina and provide an informed input to government and industry decision-making bodies.<br/>"

The partitioning of microorganisms from water to air is enhanced by common appurtenances, which are designed to entrain small air bubbles in high velocity water streams, and from systems, which rapidly propel water through air for emergency response and civil engineering applications: fire-fighting, cooling, aeration, dust abatement, and the bulk movement of water over containment barriers. Hurricane Katrina has, and will continue to require, the propulsion of large quantities of flood-impacted waters through air for these purposes. Given that these flood waters contain waterborne pathogens, and that microorganisms will certainly be aerosolized from the flood waters during emergency response and subsequent clean-up operations, a unique airborne health risk likely exists in this area. While this inhalation based exposure risk is of a different nature than that associated with 9/11 (biological rather than inorganic) much like central Manhattan, the onset and magnitude of this event has likely contributed to seriously deteriorating the air quality over a wide area of an environmental complication which has largely been ignored because of immediate survival priorities. Like the area near ground zero on and after 9/11, poor air quality may induce both acute and chronic health effects. Unlike Manhattan however, the bioaerosol exposure risk in the New Orleans flood zone may in fact increase over time, and pose a significant health threat to firefighting, engineering and other reclamation personnel, particularly near appurtenances that purposely introduce flood water streams into air. In response to this condition, the purpose of this study will be to monitor the identity, distribution and abundance of microorganisms in aerosols created near such appurtenances, and compare their ecology to that in the immediate source water using widely accepted microscopic and genetic methods.

A set of software techniques is developed based on peer-to-peer (P2P) algorithms to achieve optimal overall performance and reliability with existing hardware/software resources. The project is carried out jointly at University of California, Riverside and Suffolk University. Researchers from HP Laboratories are involved as senior personnel.<br/><br/>The web server, considered in this project, consists of geographically distributed heterogeneous nodes in a network based on different functionalities and applications of the web service. Clustering techniques are developed to create suitable P2P structures keeping in mind the topological properties of the Internet systems. Inside the cluster, scalable, efficient and high performance overlay network architectures are identified for web services. Efficient cooperative proxy cache placement and management mechanisms are developed in the virtual network following distributed shared memory (DSM) approaches. Proxy servers are combined with P2P clusters consisting of browser (client) caches, and a cooperative caching strategy is designed at the proxy level by embedding tree structures and directory schemes.

The Human Development Reports published annually by the United Nations is just one example of the growing interest in this subject. Broadly speaking, there are two non-exclusive approaches to the understanding of living standards: the approach based on income or consumption and the approach based on 'real indicators' such as nutrition, education, and health, which is also known as the 'functioning' approach. Each of these approaches has its use.  In particular, the functioning approach, which has been put on a sound conceptual foundation by the works of Nobel laureate A. Sen (1985, 1987) and the world-renowned philosopher M. Nussbaum (1988), can be of considerable help in assessing the different dimensions of the quality of life in developed as well as developing countries.  This project is the first step in a multiyear research agenda that aims to measure the standard of living based on the theory of functionings, and to provide policy formulations. We aim to deal with the issues of the quality of life that the region of Southern California is facing and will face in the near future. It is expected that in the next twenty-five years, the inland Southern California region will experience a 112 percent increase in population. This rapid growth will affect the quality of life of its residents because it will impact the supply of quality jobs, educational and health services, the transportation and communication networks, the air and water quality, and the survival of native plant and animal species. While this may be deemed too focused on our local concerns, we would like to stress that the problems that the region is experiencing are universal in nature. Therefore, Southern California emerges as a natural laboratory for the sub-regional analysis we propose.  The project has two main objectives: (i) the development of further methodological insights to the theory of functionings; and (ii) data collection for the environmental dimension of living standards in Southern California. An innovative concept ""Social Value-at-Risk"" is devised as a public policy tool that will inform the decision-making process. To achieve our goals, we will draw on the expertise of a multi-disciplinary group of engineers, social, and natural scientists. <br/>"

Turtles are an evolutionarily ancient group with a fascinating and diverse parasite fauna. It is anticipated that the project will recover representatives of six major parasite groups (phyla) and a substantial majority of the more than 100 parasite species thought to be new to science. Parasites will be collected, cataloged, identified and described as part of the project and deposited to form a public specimen base in both Australia and the United States. Although these parasites have been implicated in host disease almost nothing is known about them outside of North America. <br/><br/>Information and data from these studies will be made available directly to Australian turtle researchers and to the public through the project's WWW site. In addition to uncovering unknown aspects of Australia's biodiversity the project will generate data and specimens necessary to test a variety of hypotheses concerning parasite biodiversity, biogeography and evolution. These hypotheses provide synthetic areas of study ideal for training broadly educated students. Data from the project will inform not only studies of biodiversity, ecology and evolution, but also will be valuable to regulatory agencies involved in turtle conservation. <br/>"

Godoy<br/><br/>Department of Civil Engineering and Surveying, University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, PR 00681-9041<br/><br/>Abstract. <br/><br/>The assessments of the stability of industrial structures and oil storage tanks is mainly carried out at present using computational techniques.  However, their reliability should be validated using information from real events affecting real structures.  Such information is only available when a high consequence disaster occurs, as is the case of hurricane Katrina.  The site visit to the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina should greatly expand our existing inventories and allow a closer examination of more contentious conclusions being formulated. <br/><br/>For the case of buckling of tanks and other storage facilities, we will observe buckling modes in shells, which can be accurately recorded by means of photographs.  With the mode and the level of wind speeds recorded in the area, we will later perform computations using our finite element codes to estimate the wind speed at buckling (buckling loads) and the structural shape at buckling (buckling modes).  Comparisons between observations and predictions will allow having a more complete understanding of the mechanics of failure due to a real hurricane, so that the specific sequence of events can be reconstructed to explain the observed failures.  The observations carried out will provide evidence to confirm the lower bound approach which has been recently proposed by the PI and Prof. J. Croll.  We will also observe and document the performance of tanks founded on soft alluvial soils, which are common in the area affected by hurricane Katrina.  Structural damage due to poor foundation performance, such as differential settlements, will be recorded.<br/><br/>For the case of industrial buildings affected by hurricane Katrina, we expect fatigue modes of failure to be dominant in the majority of cases.  The pull-over rate should be a function of location, both in relations to the panel as part of the system and the system as part of the neighborhood, and those features will be observed during the visits. <br/><br/>The information gathered during the site visits will be classified and interpreted according to the state of the art in the field, and will be made available to the engineering community within two months following the site visit. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The field data collected during our site visit will lead to refinements in the current dynamic protocols, in terms of the minimum size of future specimens, failure modes not well understood at present, and the cyclic load protocol itself.  It may also help strengthen the arguments to adopt rational dynamic system rating standards.  This research will also impact the graduate program in Civil Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez.  UPRM has a growing Ph.D. program in which the topic of behavior of structures subjected to natural hazards is an integral part.  More than 95% of the students at UPRM are Hispanic.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The PI and Prof. J. Croll have recently advanced a lower bound buckling theory for wind loaded structures based on reduced energy/reduced stiffness concepts.  The observations carried out will provide evidence to confirm the lower bound approach. Such definite confirmation can only be achieved now, that the approach is mature and there are specific questions that need to be answered, and it is expected that the reconstruction of the mechanisms of failure in tanks will shed light on the interpretation of the damage observed in the field.<br/> <br/><br/>"

This position is essential for enabling the national geophysics support program planned for this instrument.  The FIB/SEM, with purchase cost greater than $1M, has been purchased for nanomaterials research on the UC Riverside campus.  Provision of this technician will enable shared use of the instrument as a ""partnership"" between UC Riverside and the NSF via the COnsortium for Mineral Properties Research in Earth Sciences (COMPRES) to provide access for members of COMPRES institutions to a FIB/SEM instrument for ""mail-order"" specimen preparation for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). User fees will be charged to all users but the NSF support of this technician will significantly defray costs to users in geology/geophysics.  This concept has been endorsed by COMPRES, which has granted additional funds toward the yearly cost of the program.  Although many advances in geology and geophysics (and in particular in mineral and rock physics) have been achieved through use of TEM since development of the ion-bombardment thinner in the late 1960s, application of TEM has been significantly constrained by the great difficulty and time involved in specimen preparation. Development of the FIB/SEM instrument now allows preparation of TEM specimens (""foils"") from precisely located sites on polished surfaces of essentially any inorganic material and at least some organic materials (polymers). The fundamental problem facing wide-spread use of such instrumentation in all branches of the Earth Sciences that deal with solids has been the very high cost of the instrument, its similarly high annual maintenance costs, and the need for a highly-trained, dedicated technician to operate it.  The partnership being established with the funding of this technician will now circumvent these problems, leading to a much lower cost than current commercial availability.  It is estimated that a price of ~$100/foil will be attainable when the program is  fully operational.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Anderson<br/>Peter Turchin<br/>University of California-Riverside<br/><br/><br/> In the last 200 years international governmental and transnational non-governmental organizations have emerged that constitute the first beginnings of world state formation, and the national states have been partially reconfigured as instruments of an increasingly integrated global elite. World state formation may be desirable because the problems created by human technological and social change are increasingly global in scope. But a world state will need to be legitimated in the eyes of a majority of the human population of the Earth and this means that democracy must be constructed on a global scale. This project allows the PIs to examine several probable future trajectories of global political integration based on models of growth, decline and systemic transformation that are developed by studying patterns of political integration in several regions over the past 3000 years.  The main purpose of the proposed project is to study and model the growth of states in selected regions of the world over the past 3000 years. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries expansion and intensification of intercontinental interactions has been called globalization. But earlier regional systems also exhibited similar waves of ""globalization,"" albeit on a smaller spatial scale, and these waves of network expansion and contraction, punctuated by occasional huge jumps in the scale of networks, eventually led to the formation of the modern global social system. This project will study the spatial nature of interaction networks over time and the relationship between these networks and the growth decline/phases of cities and states. The three-year project will develop, parameterize and test models of social change using newly upgraded estimates of the sizes of cities and states, climate change, trade routes, and warfare.<br/>The project will develop a new theoretical synthesis) model of the dynamics of agrarian state growth and decline, network theory, a population pressure and ecological model, and explanations of the rise and fall of modern hegemons. The PIs will test the hypothesis of ""semiperipheral development"" - the idea that that it has mainly been semiperipheral societies that have expanded networks, made larger states, and innovated and implemented new techniques of power and new productive technologies that have transformed the very logic of social change.<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The products of the project will provide a better understanding of long-run patterns of historical social evolution and their implications for the human future, especially world state formation. The World Historical Systems Time Map will be a spatio-temporal web-enabled data set that will be made available to scholars and students for studying probable trajectories of international political integration.<br/><br/><br/>"

Unlike yeast, many trafficking genes are essential for plants and a large proportion of knockout mutations in components of the endomembrane system are lethal. Analysis of the Arabidopsis endomembrane system has shown that beyond proper delivery of cargoes, it is essential for aspects of plant development and signal transduction. To gain new insights into the sub-cellular interactions of the endomembrane system, it is critical to examine the function(s) of these essential genes. Chemical genomics (i.e. genomics-scale chemical genetics) is the use of small molecules to modify or disrupt the function of specific proteins. By contrast, classical genetics utilizes mutations to disrupt gene function. The concept of chemical genomics is that protein structure or can be altered by chemical binding. Given the immense structural complexities of proteins compared to genes, the number of potential effectors is vast. At the practical level, chemical genomics entails screening diverse chemical libraries for effectors of a process or a gene product of interest. This approach overcomes the limitations of mutant lethality because chemicals can be applied in a spaciotemporal manner, are tunable and their effects are frequently reversible. Chemical genomics provides an alternative to classical genetics, which is often hampered by an inability to identify loss-of-function mutations associated with essential functions such as endomembrane trafficking. A chemical-genomics screen in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana identified a chemical (Sortin 1) that induces secretion of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a protein normally targeted to vacuoles via the N-terminal propeptide (NTPP) pathway. Sortin1 causes reversible defects in vacuole biogenesis and root development in seedlings. It leads to aberrant secretion of a C-terminal propeptide (CTPP) marker protein but not of a protein that is targeted via precursor vesicles that bypass the Golgi.  Experiments to be performed in this project utilize biochemistry, proteomics, cell biology, and combinatorial chemistry to investigate Sortin 1 effects on protein targeting pathway(s). The molecular targets of the compound will be identified via hypersensitive and resistant mutant screens; two will be characterized in detail. An approach applicable to nonmodel organisms will also be pursued in which a tagged triazine library of compounds will be screened for new chemicals that interfere with vacuole targeting. These chemicals can also be immobilized for rapid affinity based target purification. The major goal of this project is to identify and analyze new components of trafficking pathways and their interaction with related signal transduction and developmental networks. It will also provide a suite of new approaches for investigating any essential pathway of interest. The bioactive chemicals to be identified will be useful for probing conserved processes such as endomembrane trafficking in other organisms. Targets identified in Arabidopsis may be used in non-model species to improve agronomic traits and increase crop value. Young scientists involved in this project will have a broad integrated experience within interdisciplinary chemical genomics research and will be well trained and prepared for independent academic careers."

It faces three challenges: to compile sufficient data, to integrate<br/>multiple databases, and to maintain tools that can assemble all the local data records into a geologic time<br/>line. The third challenge amounts to sequencing the fossil record and we propose to address three of the<br/>obstacles it faces: (1) Fossil biotas of the same age may differ as a result of habitat and preservation<br/>effects; (2) Very large data sets must be sequenced in smaller pieces and the results stitched seamlessly<br/>together; (3) Increasing numbers of dated and fingerprinted ash beds need to used more effectively. We<br/>propose a case study of manageable geographic and temporal extent that, nevertheless, raises these same<br/>issues. The Ordovician and Silurian periods span almost 100 million years of early Paleozoic time and are<br/>traditionally subdivided by graptolites and conodonts - two fossil clades with different ecological and<br/>preservational traits that restrict their use to largely mutually exclusive domains.<br/>The Mohawkian (Late Ordovician) of eastern North America presents precisely the type of<br/>challenging geological environment in which to build and test the temporal sequencing and stitching<br/>approaches that we envision. Mohawkian strata are widely exposed in the region and yield a rich fossil<br/>record that includes diverse, but somewhat endemic, conodont faunas. The epicratonic succession is<br/>rimmed along the Appalachian margin by deeper water sediments of the Taconic foreland basin. These<br/>strata contain a suite of inter-continentally distributed graptolite faunas, but few described conodont<br/>assemblages. Numerous altered volcanic ash deposits (K-bentonites) link these facies through a set of<br/>transitional facies along the interior basin margin. Despite these advantages, the prevalence of short<br/>sections, structural complexity, and facies limitation of the faunas impedes precise and reliable correlation<br/>between the cratonic and basinal successions, consequently limiting our ability to compare their disparate<br/>faunas and tectonic histories.<br/>Intellectual Merit: We propose to combine (1) geochemical fingerprinting (tephrochronology) and<br/>U-Pb geochronology of K-bentonites from the Mohawkian and early Cincinnatian with (2) a restudy of<br/>late Mohawkian conodonts and graptolites from eleven regions across eastern North America and (3)<br/>computer assisted sequencing of the global Ordovician conodont and graptolite fossil record. This work<br/>will provide a detailed temporal and paleoecological framework within which to refine the application of<br/>biofacies information to the temporal sequencing of the fossil record via rigorous quantitative techniques.<br/>We will focus in steps 1 and 2 particularly on conodont and graptolite-bearing successions that contain Kbentonites,<br/>and especially on regions where conodonts and graptolites occur in close association.<br/>The results of our work in a time interval that remains troublesome in spite of a wide range of timestratigraphic<br/>information will bear upon fundamental questions in both local and global stratigraphy. In<br/>the course of this study we will test existing alternate correlation models for the mid Upper Ordovician of<br/>central and eastern North America. The results will provide an improved, age-calibrated basis for studies<br/>of faunal turnover and diversity change in the Ordovician and Silurian. Most importantly, the work will<br/>lead to the development of improved techniques for time scale construction and validation.<br/>Broader Impact: The data and tools we develop will be shared immediately through the CHRONOS<br/>project and will investigate technological solutions that are not being addressed by CHRONOS to<br/>sequence events. The project meets the EARTHTIME goal of cross-training stratigraphers and<br/>geochronologists in developing high precision time-scales.

We will integrate the efforts of four institutions, two with large<br/>minority enrolment (UCR, UALR), in a new collaboration that will facilitate the interaction of all the<br/>students and PIs at each institution. Undergraduates will participate as field and lab assistants for the PIs<br/>and for the graduate students, and will be given pieces of the project as senior research projects. Each<br/>student will present aspects of the research at a professional meeting. The project will also include a<br/>secondary school teacher who will work alongside PI Leslie during the summer as part of the Arkansas<br/>STRIVE program.

The requested funds would be highly leveraged because most of the cost of drilling a 5km deep borehole will be borne by industry and the Icelandic government, with participation from the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program.  An Icelandic geothermal power company is providing an existing ~ 3 km deep well for deepening to 5 km depth.

Logic controllers are used for many applications such as manufacturing systems, satellites, autonomous robots, and active databases.  At a low level, a logic controller is simply a set of rules.  However, when hundreds or thousands of these rules are acting together in a complex system, unexpected or undesirable behavior can occur.  This project will develop modular verification technologies that will allow much more complex systems to be verified than are possible with existing centralized techniques.  It will also investigate whether some properties of a system cannot be verified in a modular fashion, thus giving insight into the distinction between global and local properties of logic control systems.<br/><br/>As systems become more complex -- for example, cars with antilock brakes, electronic stability control, and four-wheel steering; or telephones with call waiting, call forwarding, and caller ID - the various new features can interfere with each other.  This feature interference can cause unexpected behaviors to occur in the system, called ""automation surprises.""  Because of the complexity, it is impossible for the designer to imagine all possible combinations of environmental factors and user commands and check that the system behaves as desired.

These initiatives include: (1) Scholars Assisting Scholars which employs exceptional students from underrepresented populations to staff a tutoring program that serves all students, (2) Campus Internships which allows first-year students to investigate engineering early to help maintain their interest as they take foundation courses that can be discouraging, (3) Job Shadowing which provides an opportunity to follow a practicing engineer or scientist as they engage in their regular activities, (4)Hands-On Engineering which offers the opportunity to gain laboratory exposure with a variety of engineering and science instruments before actually taking the course that utilizes them, (5) Turbo Math which is an intensive summer program to allow students to ""catch-up"" in math, and (6) K-State Family Connections  which creates communication linkages with family and friends of students to support their success in engineering and science.  Through these activities and the resulting system to support retention, the investigators intend to obtain a 10% Increase in the total number of BS graduates in STEM fields, a 25% increase in the number of women earning BS degrees in STEM fields, and a 50% increase in the number of students of color earning BS STEM degrees.

While, in the past decade the complete sequences of many plant and animal genomes have been elucidated, the function of many genes and their protein products are not fully understood.  Two approaches to understanding gene function (functional genomics) are (1) proteomics, in which the protein gene products carrying out specific cellular functions are identified and characterized, and (2) metabolomics, in which metabolites, formed by the action of the protein gene products, are identified and quantified.  Two branches of metabolomics are glycomics, which deals with analysis of carbohydrate metabolites, and lipidomics, which deals with lipid metabolite analysis.  The characterization of both protein gene products and most metabolites can be best accomplished by mass spectrometry, a technique in which biomolecules are ionized and identified by the masses of molecular ions and their derivative ions.  The goal of this project is to acquire four mass spectrometers at Kansas State University with which to accomplish this research. These instruments will be utilized for functional genomics by users at Kansas State University and elsewhere.<br/><br/>The users of the requested instrumentation work in two major areas of functional genomics, plant metabolism and signaling systems in animals.  The plant scientists are investigating gene expression and function during plant abiotic and biotic stress and during development.  The animal scientists are utilizing mass spectrometric strategies to understand the interplay and roles of proteins and lipids in lipoprotein complexes, membrane lipid rafts, membrane channel function, and immune responses.  Acquisition of the mass spectrometers will open doors for new ways of determining the functions of biomolecules, enhancing both scientific and technical training.  Formal and informal training on the utility and use of the new instrumentation will be offered to instrument users, including technical staff, undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, and faculty at all levels.  <br/><br/>Acquisition of these mass spectrometers will broaden and improve the training and research capabilities of undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral students, and faculty.  The availability of these instruments will enhance and strengthen the research programs of life scientists in the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Agriculture, Human Ecology, and Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University, and scientists at other institutions in the United States and around the world. Use of the instruments should lead to greater understanding of gene product functions, of the roles of lipids, and of interactions between proteins and lipids in plants and animals. Making mass spectrometry instrumentation available for fundamental research in chemistry and biology will lead to practical applications in industry, medicine, and agriculture.<br/>"

The objectives of the proposed research are to understand the origin of persistent, but enigmatic ~1-5 My-scale sea-level changes which result in the deposition of transgressive-regressive marine sequences tens to about a hundred meters thick. The method used to evaluate the origin of these sequences is to analyze the delta-18 Oxygen values of conodonts (extinct apatitic marine microfossils) from selected Ordovician through Triassic sequences to determine if a systematic relationship exists between del 18-O values and transgressive-regressive facies trends.<br/><br/>If a systematic relationship between del 18-O values and transgressive/regressive facies trends is observed, then this will indicate that My-scale climate changes are responsible for sequence development. If no relationship between del 18-O values and facies changes is observed, then tectonic process(es) unrelated to climate change are responsible. The research will also evaluate the depth habitat of certain Ordovician and Triassic conodonts; this is crucial for reconstructing depth-dependent marine paleotemperatures and isotopic compositions. <br/><br/>This research is primarily focused on understanding the My-scale controls on the infilling of marine basins. If the sea-level changes are, in fact, controlled by climate variations, facies-independent sea-level curves can be constructed and the argument for long-period orbital forcing modulation is supported. This may permit using these sequences for calibrating the Paleozoic-Triassic geological time scale, much like shorter term orbital cycles (~20-100 ky) are being used to calibrate the Cenozoic time scale. <br/><br/>The techniques, data, and results will be utilized to develop hands-on, inquiry-based laboratory exercises for undergraduate Earth History and Sedimentology-Stratigraphy classes at UNM. The techniques and results will also be incorporated into graduate-level lectures in Carbonate Stratigraphy, Paleoclimatology, and Stable Isotope Geology. Results from this research will be presented at conferences (GSA, AGU, AAPG), in appropriate journal publications, and invited university seminars."

To uncover these mechanisms, the study draws on field observations of application procedures, and semi-structured interviews with applicants, their co-nationals in Argentina, Italy, and Spain, and government agents. To reveal the consequences of identification and categorization practices, it also examines public discourse surrounding claims to ancestral homeland state membership in each country (e.g. in legislative debates and media coverage). The author argues that the process by which affinity policies shape national identifications and categorizations is one of searching organizational archives for officially valid documentation to support membership claims. In terms of consequences, ethnic affinity policies have generated greater heterogeneity in national affiliations and allegiances in Argentina, Italy and Spain than would otherwise be the case. The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in (1) its empirical focus on a relatively unexplored yet theoretically revealing case, (2) a substantive attention to national categorization as seen not only in laws and regulations, but also at the level of bureaucratic encounters (where much policy is actually negotiated), and (3) an emphasis on the largely unstudied consequences of multiple national affiliations on all implicated countries. The broader impact of the project includes (1) solidifying and expanding social scientific networks spanning Latin America, the United States and Europe with benefits to the applicant, sponsoring researchers, and participating minority students, (2) broadening the participation of persons underrepresented at research universities, and (3) disseminating findings not only to interested scholars but also to study participants and to a lay audience interested in how nationality operates to include and to exclude in practical ways.

In spite of hurricane warnings and evacuation mandates, thousands of individuals remained in the affected area.  In the aftermath of Katrina, the lack of sufficient aid for the large number of people remaining in the New Orleans area contributed to the scope of the disaster.  This project will explore the geographical, psychological, and social factors related to compliance with mandatory hurricane evacuation orders in southeastern Louisiana prior to hurricane landfall.  Understanding of compliance and noncompliance regarding evacuation under a hazard situation is critical to risk management. Data will be collected through interviews with individuals who previously or currently reside in areas placed under mandatory evacuation orders prior to Katrina's landfall.  Both those who evacuated and those who rejected an evacuation mandate will be included in the study.  A survey conducted by the University of New Orleans (UNO) Survey Research Center that was released by the Southeast Louisiana Hurricane Task Force six weeks prior to Katrina explored some of these same questions and offers benchmark from which to examine actual behavior in relation to self reports of intentions prior to Katrina.<br/><br/>Understanding the geographical, social, and other factors illuminates human motivations and barriers germane to management of hurricane hazards.  Such understanding can help public authorities and agencies dealing with emergency management to design more effective hurricane preparedness and evacuation communication programs.

They also have tremendous conservation value, housing the world's remaining large grazing animals, particularly in Africa. A fundamental understanding of the factors most important for sustaining savanna grasslands, fire and grazing, is required for their management and conservation. Yet scientists have questioned whether grasslands in different regions function similarly. Convergence in function would mean that ecological understanding and conservation strategies could be generalized worldwide. But contingent factors specific to a region, such as differences in history or the types of grazers present may lead to unique responses in some savanna grasslands. The goal of this research is to compare key ecological processes to fire and grazing in savanna grasslands in North America and South Africa. Scientists will take advantage of three ongoing long-term experiments that manipulate these key factors and compare responses in productivity, biodiversity, and nutrient cycling. <br/><br/>As humans alter fire and grazing regimes worldwide, comparative research elucidating the consequences is needed to develop management strategies that can insure the sustainability of savanna grasslands. This research will provide the basic knowledge necessary to do so, and will afford training and important global and cultural experiences for young scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students.<br/>"

Telerobotic systems consist of an operator handling one manipulator (the master) directly controlling a remote manipulator (the slave), which acts on an external object.  Current state of the art force feedback telerobotic systems employ DC motors, hydraulics, or other linear actuators to simulate the resistances encountered when the remote slave touches an external object.  These systems suffer from the following drawbacks: (1) Slave inertias are in general considerably larger than their corresponding master inertias, which leads to the feedback of large signals emanating from impacts between the slave and its external object. (2) Force feedback necessitates larger components (motors, hydraulics, etc.), limiting the systems' use in a number of applications, especially minimally invasive telerobotic surgery. (3) Multi degree of freedom force feedback systems are inherently complex due to the coupling of electromechanical and control issues with a human interface, leading to prohibitive cost. By synergistically combining novel 3-D MR fluid devices with the full 3-D microstructural analysis and control, the PIs will create novel force feedback systems that overcome the limitations of traditional force feedback systems, listed above. <br/><br/>This study will focus on telerobotic systems, mainly telerobotic surgery which consists of a surgeon handling one manipulator (the master) directly controlling a remote robot (the slave), which acts on the patient. Current systems only produce visual feedback.  The goal of this endeavor will be to provide not only visual feedback to the surgeon but tactile feedback as well. Among the many applications of this research will be the ability to enable a surgeon in New York to safely operate on a soldier in Iraq.  The fundamental research contribution is the development of specially designed magnetorheological (MR) fluid devices and the accompanying software to control them. An MR fluid, consisting of micro and nano sized iron particles suspended in oil, greatly changes its ability to flow with the application of a low level applied magnetic field.  These MR fluid devices will have the ability to mimic from afar the resistance encountered by the robot, thereby enabling the surgeon to realistically ""feel"" what the remote robot encounters.  The advances of this research can also be applied to industrial machines, biomedicine, aerospace systems, robotics, video and computer games, and virtual reality devices.  As a part of the effort to promote learning and education in broad levels, the investigators will engage both college undergraduates and middle school students in the research. In reference to outreach, the investigators will spearhead a two-week engineering mini camp for ""at risk"" 8th grade girls. <br/>"

QMC is one among the most precise known techniques to study realistic materials in physics and chemistry and provide a significant gain in precision compared traditional density functional theory (DFT) approaches. This will bring electronic structure quantum Monte Carlo methodology to a qualitatively higher level of applicability to complex materials and lead to increased accuracy. The new QMC techniques will be applied to forefront problems in the properties of Earth materials in order to obtain accurate equations of state, phase transitions, and elasticity of solid materials that are of high interest in geophysics. One significant limitation of today's QMC methods is the high computational demand, which currently makes applications to larger systems including solid solutions prohibitively expensive. A substantial portion of the QMC computation is spent on forming and evaluating a Slater determinant, which is constructed from one-particle orbitals. The team plans to develop and apply different localization transformations in order to obtain a sparse determinant. Two linear algebra methods will be developed for their efficient evaluation. First, Krylov's method for the iterative evaluation of a determinant will be incorporated into QMC. Secondly, the trace of the determinant will be calculated with Monte Carlo methods. Both techniques will further the goal of obtaining an order-N QMC techniques that are more efficient and applicable to a wider range of materials, well beyond the current possibilities.<br/><br/>Computational mineral physics is part of the large effort to use computer simulations to predict and understand properties of the Earth.

This work will also lead to a more precise description of a number of fundamental phase transitions in solid deep Earth. This project is a close collaboration between a mathematician, mathematical physicists, and geophysicists.

Grottoli and Pease will investigate the underlying mechanisms influencing coral recovery and mortality during bleaching by studying carbon acquisition, allocation and utilization of the coral host. During bleaching, when corals loose their symbiotic algae and their supply of photosynthetically fixed carbon is dramatically reduced or lost, they must rely on other sources of energy such as stored lipids and carbohydrates, or heterotrophically acquired carbon to sustain their energetic demands. If (1) corals are better able to acquire carbon by increasing heterotrophic feeding, they may be more likely to survive bleaching and fully recover. Alternatively, if (2) corals are able to store larger amounts of excess energy reserves during non-bleaching periods (e.g., as lipids), they may be able to sustain themselves by utilizing these reserves until fully recovered. If (3) corals are more efficient at utilizing these stored energy reserves, they may be more likely to recover from bleaching. All three of these strategies are hypothesized mechanisms used by corals to promote recovery following bleaching.   <br/><br/>In order to evaluate each mechanism, these investigators will perform a series of 13C-pulse labeling experiments designed to track the source of the fixed carbon, its allocation and storage within the host, and its utilization in bleached Montipora capitata and Porites compressa corals over the course of 14 months of recovery (relative to non-bleached controls). The experimental design allows for simultaneously measured variables to be comprehensively interpreted within the overall picture of the coral-algal symbiont-skeleton system relative to a control group.   <br/><br/>The results of this research will contribute to a better understanding in fundamental biology of coral bleaching by experimentally evaluating the physiological and biogeochemical responses of corals to temperature-induced bleaching stressors both during bleaching and recovery.  This work will build the framework for understanding the causes and consequences of bleaching on corals.  <br/><br/>This project involves the training of two PhD students (one with each collaborating investigator), a Postdoc, and two undergraduate students. Both investigators will incorporate research results from this project in their teaching and present the research in public lectures and through established K-12 outreach and teacher in-service training workshops. <br/><br/><br/>"

In essence these arrays, due to their autonomous features,<br/>adaptability to varying environmental conditions, and their own complex dynamics, will<br/>qualify to be called arti.cial organisms. Empowering them with autonomous control features<br/>will be a necessary task which will be quite di.erent from any of the control design problems<br/>encountered today. This proposal addresses the problem of designing controllers for such<br/>systems. It is argued that pattern formation is the key to controlling these systems. In<br/>contrast to simple electrical engineering circuitry, all organisms seem to be capable of (a)<br/>producing a large number of di.erent patterns, and in addition (b) capable of fast and<br/>graceful transition from one pattern to another. Control methodology sought after here will<br/>be mindful of these requirements. The question of what are appropriate patterns has for the<br/>most part been already addressed by biologists, physicists and mathematicians. However,<br/>there are two associated control challenges; (a) embedding such an equation in the natural<br/>dynamics of a mems or a nano array, and (b) how to design a control system to ensure<br/>quick and graceful transition from one pattern to another.

Most bacteria live by creating habitats on the surface of solid particles such as minerals, which may be located in soil, subsurface, or aquatic environments.  Bacteria perceive the presence of mineral surfaces through force ""cues"", which allow a cell to physically feel another surface.  While inter- and intra-molecular forces dominate the lives of microorganisms, their seemingly infinitesimal magnitude and length-scale have made them difficult to study.  This proposed research will begin to shed light onto this problem though a unique combination of molecular modeling, force measurements, and microscopic images of well-characterized silica minerals and bacteria that have been genetically modified to produce specific cell wall macromolecules.  <br/><br/>First, the natural distribution, density, and acid-base reactivity of functional groups on specific faces of phyllosilicate and silicate crystals (and possibly also on the surface of a bacterium) will be determined with atomic force titration measurements.  These measurements will be interpreted with a new method for predicting acid-base reactivity of individual functional groups that involves ab initio structure calculations.  Second, atomic force microscopy will be used to measure intermolecular forces between wild-type and mutant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and silicate minerals.  These force measurements will be interpreted in light of the previously obtained molecular-scale models of the mineral surface acid-base reactivities.  The intellectual merit of this proposal is that the combination of molecular models with force measurements will allow an unprecedented view of the fundamental forces or cues that exist at the interface between a living bacterium and mineral surface in situ.  This goal will be accomplished through the collective efforts of our interdisciplinary research team that includes scientists specializing in geochemistry, mineralogy and molecular modeling (Bickmore and Lewis), geomicrobiology and nanoscience (Lower and Beveridge), and physical force laws (Dutcher and Israelachvili).  <br/><br/> The microorganism used in these experiments, P. aeruginosa, is a model Gram negative bacterium.  It is ubiquitous in water, soil, and subsurface environments where it lives on the surface of minerals or other particles.  It is also a common bacteria species on plants and animals, where it often functions as an opportunistic pathogen.  The minerals used in these experiments include silicates, which are the most common inorganic phases on Earth.  Probing the interface between P. aeruginosa and silicate minerals will have broader implications and societal benefits that can be applied to issues ranging from the transport of microorganisms in aquifers to the formation of biofilms on solid substrates.  Further, this proposal will impact the lives of a number of graduate students and undergraduates.  These students will be cross trained in biochemistry, microbiology, geochemistry, and mineralogy, and they will also gain experience with state-of-the-art instruments such as scanning probe microscopes, laser scanning microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.  Finally, this proposal will provide funds to support K-6 outreach programs that are designed to expose young students to the interplay between the biological and physical sciences.<br/>"

This segregation is associated with crime and other deleterious conditions for communities with high concentrations of disadvantaged and minority residents, but carries benefits for more advantaged and White localities. These differential outcomes of segregation have been interpreted as evidence that the spatial isolation of minority neighborhoods produces social problems by creating and reinforcing social and structural isolation. However, most crime studies rely on measures that do not take into account the location of segregated areas relative to one another.  As such, they leave unanswered the question of how the inherently spatial nature of segregation is connected with the geographic distribution of criminal activity. This research draws on studies of segregation and its consequences, analyses of geographic variation in crime, and aggregate and multilevel crime research to develop a model that brings space into the analysis of crime. Our broad question is: How does racial, ethnic, and associated economic segregation affect the geographic distribution of crime? Answering this general question entails addressing four specific objectives: (1) developing more refined spatially-based measures of locally segregated (along a variety of dimensions) areas using the best Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data and techniques; (2) identifying what aspects of the physical infrastructure of local communities affect crime; (3) determining how the effects on crime of nearby localities vary across neighborhoods within cities; and (4) evaluating how the effects of local segregation on neighborhood crime varies across cities. Thus, the intellectual merit of the study consists of the light it will shed on the linkages among city-wide segregation, local segregation, and neighborhood crime through meeting these objectives. <br/><br/>The project will analyze data for 10 large U.S. cities for circa 2000: Austin, Boston,<br/>Chicago, Columbus, Fort Worth, Jacksonville, Milwaukee, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, and Portland.  The 10 cities cover a range of Black-White segregation, incorporate regional variation, and have relatively large Hispanic and/or Black populations. National Neighborhood Crime Study (NNCS) data will be combined with GIS-based measures of local segregation and physical and ecological characteristics of areas derived from GIS databases on digital transportation networks and parcel- and building-level land use, and other public sources. State-of-the-art GIS analyses and hierarchical Bayesian spatial statistical modeling techniques will be used to evaluate our theoretical model. The modeling strategy is designed to highlight the substantive spatial effects of different types of local segregation (e.g., by race, Hispanic origin, economic status) on crime, while controlling for residual spatial dependence in crime caused by unmeasured conditions. The hierarchical Bayesian approach also permits the within-city and between-city substantive issues to be explored in an integrated manner that accounts for residual spatial dependence.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Substantively, the study will shed light on how a major social process (i.e., segregation) fosters inequality in the prevalence of crime among diverse groups within cities. Beyond its substantive impact, this work will: (1) integrate thinking in three different fields about the sources of neighborhood crime, laying a foundation for future advances in interdisciplinary work on this important policy topic; (2) develop methodological strategies that will serve as models for research in a variety of fields seeking to integrate multiple types of spatial data and concepts; (3) make available to the scientific community newly refined GIS-based measures of local segregation and neighborhood physical and ecological characteristics as supplements to the NNCS; and, (4) provide an attractive topic and diverse mentors for undergraduate and graduate students of color and from economically disadvantaged backgrounds seeking to enhance their ability to conduct research."

There are many examples in the geological record of calving glaciers that underwent rapid change. The best-known examples of such behavior are the Heinrich events, marking short-lived periods of significantly increased iceberg production from the Laurentide Ice Sheet.  The Principal Investigators will apply a numerical model to describe and explain the observed retreat of Columbia Glacier, Alaska, and of Kangerlussuaq Glacier, Greenland. The lessons learned from studying these glaciers can be applied to other calving glaciers, to explain past changes as well as predict possible future changes.  Columbia Glacier is a tidewater glacier that has been retreating at an increasing rate since the early 1980s. The period prior to, and the subsequent retreat, have been documented by aerial photogrammetry, conducted by the U.S.G.S. for about five times a year since 1976. This data set is the most complete for any calving glacier and covers both seasonal variations and long-term changes in glacier speed and geometry. Kangerlussuaq Glacier is a fast-moving calving glacier that underwent rapid thinning during the 1990s and data has been compiled on surface elevation and glacier speed from the 1930s. While not as extensive as the Columbia Glacier data set, available data are sufficient to constrain numerical models and investigate processes most likely responsible for the behavior of this outlet glacier. The most important question concerning Columbia Glacier and other calving glaciers is what processes may initiate retreat and what feedback mechanisms are important in sustaining retreat. To answer this question, the Principal Investigator proposes to adopt a heuristic approach in which the rate of iceberg production is estimated from a calving criterion. Two different formulations will be incorporated into the model and their predictions tested against the available data. Similarly, by incorporating simple yet realistic sliding relations, the model will be used to test the hypothesis that the speed up during retreat may be associated with glacier thinning and approach to flotation, lowering the effective basal pressure. Finally, he will investigate the role of sediment recycling and the formation of a terminal moraine bank, and whether this process is essential for allowing the terminus to advance down the fjord.<br/><br/>Scientific Merit: The main goal of this project is to identify processes most important in controlling the life cycle of calving glaciers, typified by a prolonged period of slow terminus advance to a relative stable terminus located at the mouth of the fjord, followed by a brief period of rapid retreat and disintegration of the lower reaches. Until now, most studies concerning tidewater glaciers have focused on specific aspects, such as calving, sediment deposition, etc., but few attempts have been made to integrate the various ideas and suggestions into a single model with applications to a well-documented glacier.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: While the proposed work focuses on Columbia Glacier primarily, better<br/>understanding of the dynamics of calving glaciers will have broader applications, in particular reducing uncertainties in future sea-level rise scenarios and the contribution of calving glaciers to this rise. <br/>"

It aims to understand the time that it takes for non-equilibrium spin distributions to disappear once they are created. All semiconductor materials will be considered, but there will be a particular focus on silicon and gallium arsenide, which have the most technological importance. Furthermore, the devices under consideration confine the motion of the electrons in a way that affects the spin decay. This will also be taken into account. There are multiple causes for this spin decay or relaxation. This will necessitate the development of computer programs to handle the complex interaction of different mechanisms.<br/><br/>Broad Impact<br/>Most of the important technological advances in the last 50 years have been closely associated with the progress of electronics, which, in physical terms, is the manipulation of electronic charge.  In computer technology in particular, this manipulation is done in semiconductors. This steady advance has shown signs of slowing in the last decade or so, and the future will depend on the manipulation of electronic spin - the field of spintronics. This proposal aims at increasing our theoretical understanding of the behavior of electron spins in semiconductors. This area is the most promising for technology in the short term, since spintronics in semiconductors would allow rapid integration with current manufacturing techniques.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit<br/>Many basic mechanisms of spin relaxation in semiconductors are reasonably well understood.  However, crucial difficulties remain. The effect of magnetic fields, doping ranges and particularly geometry of devices introduce complications that can change the relaxation in very significant ways. The work proposed here focuses on some novel physical mechanisms that we believe are central to understanding these unresolved issues. The most important of these novel insights is spin transfer between extended and localized states. This is not a spin relaxation in itself, since the transfer conserves spin, but the transfer accelerates spin relaxation. A second point is the unexpectedly large field dependence of the spin-phonon relaxation due to symmetry considerations and the phonon density of states. These insights will be incorporated into computer calculations of spin relaxation from all mechanisms to achieve quantitative understanding of relaxation times. This will be a major advance the theory of spin relaxation in semiconductors.<br/><br/>"

Because cnidarians diverged from the rest of the animals prior to the evolution of organs, their overall anatomy is quite simple. Despite this however, cnidarians have attained incredible diversity, comprising over 11,000 species, many of which display elaborate structures and complex life histories. The lack of organs and other anatomical landmarks has made it difficult for scientists to discern their evolutionary relationships. Recent technological and theoretical advances in the sequencing and analysis of DNA provide the opportunity to use the information encoded within an organism's genetic code to elucidate evolutionary relationships. The primary aim of this proposal is to obtain DNA sequence data from 1,800 cnidarian species: this will generate approximately 23 million base pairs of cnidarian DNA sequence, and the specimens from which the sequences are obtained will be retained in natural history museum collections. The information encoded in the DNA will be used to reconstruct cnidarian phylogenies (evolutionary trees), using computer algorithms and supercomputing facilities. Some of the questions this proposal will address are: Was the ancestor to all of cnidarians solitary or colonial? Are jellyfish or hydras more closely related to the corals? How and when did coral skeletons evolve? What are the evolutionary transitions between a simple hydra polyp and a complex Portuguese Man-of-War colony? Reconstructing a cnidarian evolutionary tree is important for our understanding of the patterns and processes that accompanied the early diversification of animal life. <br/><br/><br/><br/>        Formal and informal education will result from this research. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars, including those belonging to groups under-represented in the sciences, will be trained. A symposium on cnidarian evolutionary relationships will be organized by the investigators at a national scientific meeting. A Cnidaria Tree of Life database will be developed to include outreach and learning components such as images, common names, and keys designed to appeal to students at all levels as well as interested users such as divers and aquarists. Museum exhibits will be created based on research results, one at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum, and one, entitled ""Cnidarian Diversity in the Oceans"" that will be part of the new Oceans Hall, due to open at the National Museum of Natural History in 2008. A website and classroom poster (in both English and Spanish) integrated with the latter exhibit will be created in collaboration with a K-12 educator supported through NSF's Research Experience for Teachers program. <br/><br/><br/>"

The goals include increasing the number of minority students enrolled, the establishment of permanent infrastructure on each campus to support diversity, the establishment of permanent programs on each campus and across the alliance to support diversity and a diverse population of graduate students, and the development of a publishable set of techniques and guidelines that can be used by any university and which we hope will lead to a national forum for the exchange of ideas and best practices for promoting diversity.  The four key elements of the alliance include: 1) alliance-level activities (e.g., an annual student research conference and the creation of common recruiting materials and coordinated recruiting efforts; 2) recruitment through the implementation of an Alliance Visiting Scholars Program and coordination of recruiting efforts at major conferences, fairs and university visits; 3) increased retention of students by recruiting a cadre of social and behavioral professors and scholars who will provide instant, multi-level mentoring network and developing  transition programs; and 4) increased activities and programs targeted at undergraduates in a wider range of universities and colleges to increase the pool of students.  The number of universities in the alliance will allow the alliance to analyze the effectiveness of new strategies for broadening participation and the transference of existing techniques to new settings. <br/><br/>Broader Impact:  The alliance will develop written materials that can be distributed to all universities in the US and could be the basis for a national exchange of ideas about alliances as a strategy to broaden participation in US institutions of higher learning.<br/>"

This framework will be used to study the biocomplexity of transportation fuels : gasoline, ethanol, biodiesel and hydrogen, and to understand the transitional effects of switching between fuels. Motivated by environmental and geopolitical concerns, transportation fuels such as ethanol, biodiesel and hydrogen are often suggested as viable alternatives to existing fossil fuels. However, sensible selection among these options requires an understanding of their technical, economic, environmental and social implications. This is a challenging task due to the complex supply and delivery networks of these materials, the many alternative raw materials and manufacturing pathways, the variety of emissions and their impacts, uncertain data and models, interaction with economic factors and the effect of social preferences.

The project is significant because it will move the field forward in providing a more meaningful, comprehensive, and nuanced understanding of to what degree, how, and why race, ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice are interrelated. Importantly, the intellectual merit of the project will be in expanding our current understanding of the meaning of race and ethnicity in crime and criminal justice, while also embedding knowledge of the observed linkages within the context of the broader positioning (racial/ethnic structure) of groups in society. Two types of activities geared are planned to achieve the specific objectives identified above. First, the PIs will hold a series of workshops and related meetings. The first of these will be held in conjunction with the 2005 annual meeting of the American Society of Criminology in Toronto, Canada. The second will be held during June or July 2006 in Columbus, Ohio. During these meetings, agenda setting activities, including identifying gaps in research beyond those generated in previous workshops and discussing additional outlets for disseminating and setting the agenda items in the context of existing knowledge will be undertaken.  The workshops and meetings will also serve as vehicles for identifying topics and funding sources for collaborative research projects to address major neglected issues in the study of race, ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice. Small groups will then work on developing the design and seeking funding for the projects with feedback from the larger study group. Our second mechanism for expanding understanding of the race/ethnicity-crime/criminal justice link is through holding a summer research and professional development institute for young scholars from underrepresented groups. At the institute, each participant will complete a research project with guided training and mentoring in a ""safe"" and resource enriched environment. At the culmination of the institute, there will be a mini-conference where participants present their work to the broader set of scholars involved in this project. This will provide an additional mechanism for institute participants to gain feedback and develop relationships (network) with other senior and junior scholars in the field. The summer institute will take place in Columbus, Ohio during the summer of 2006.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This project is structured to have several specific broader impacts on scholarship and the academy. First, it will signal to the larger research community the types of research issues, theoretical frameworks, and methodological strategies that are required to improve knowledge in an important area. Second, it will draw on the expertise of scholars who are diverse along a number of dimensions (e.g., race and ethnicity, disciplinary training, and stage of career) to develop significant innovative research projects that take into account the complexity of race/ethnicity and embed analysis in the differential positioning of groups in society. Third, it will broaden participation in crime and justice research by fostering the careers of scholars from underrepresented groups. Together these will have a more general impact in bringing diverse and innovative perspectives to bear on research and curricula, thereby yielding new insights on the role of race and ethnicity in outcomes like crime and criminal justice decisions into the future.<br/>"

This project addresses this question both theoretically and empirically. It first develops a two-phase model of market-oriented institutional transitions. It then focuses on the longitudinal process to move from a relationship-based, personalized transaction structure calling for a network-centered strategy to a rule-based, impersonal exchange regime suggesting a market-centered strategy. The central hypothesis is that as institutional transitions progress, networks and connections, previously thought to be imperative for business success, may become less important. Instead, competitive resources and capabilities are likely to be more significant determinants of firm performance.<br/><br/>Empirically, the project proposes three large-scale, multi-year studies. Study 1 will collect longitudinal case data from two partner organizations with operations in over a dozen cities in China. Study 2 will employ a two-wave survey methodology to collect data from approximately 300-450 firms in China, separated by two years between each survey. Finally, Study 3 will replicate and extend the China studies in two other important emerging economies, Thailand and Russia, using a similar two-wave survey methodology.<br/>The project.s dynamic integration of institutional and strategic choice theories and its longitudinal and multinational empirical design promise especially interesting insights. It synthesizes a diverse but scattered literature on emerging economies to form a coherent contribution. It explains, predicts, and aims to empirically document the mechanisms through which the importance of networks is gradually eclipsed by the importance of capabilities. This project thus highlights the relative decline of networks and connections (albeit still important) vis-a-vis competitive capabilities during institutional transitions.<br/><br/>In terms of its broader impacts, the project advances discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning. The primary educational component includes the development of three .Emerging Markets Field Study. courses, one for MBAs, one for Executive MBAs, and another for undergraduates, that capitalize on the learning from this project.

It facilitates broad dissemination through publications in practitioner-oriented journals and online media as well as briefings to partner organizations and other interdisciplinary outreach activities. Finally, it fosters connections between discoveries and their benefits to the global society. Given the rising importance of emerging economies, our research and teaching activities need to move out of our familiar OECD mindset and pay more attention to emerging economies, if we endeavor to remain globally relevant.

The end result of this association is the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by the symbiont for the benefit of the host. This interaction is highly dependent on the release and recognition of signal molecules produced by each partner. The main goal of this project is to determine how production of one of these signal molecules, the bacterially produced exopolysaccharides, is regulated and coordinated during the symbiotic process. <br/><br/>S. meliloti produces at least two exopolysaccharides (succinoglycan and EPS II) that serve as invasion signals during the bacterial-plant interaction. Previous research has demonstrated that specific low molecular weight forms of these exopolysaccharides need to be generated by the bacterium to enable their role as signal molecules. More recently the researchers discovered and characterized three quorum-sensing systems (Mel, Sin/ExpR and Tra) in S. meliloti and showed that at least one of these (the Sin/ExpR system) plays an important role in exopolysaccharide production and nodulation. This project will explore how the biosynthesis of the symbiotically important exopolysaccharides of S. meliloti and the production of their active low molecular weight forms are regulated and coordinated. It is increasingly evident that the exopolysaccharides produced by S. meliloti play specific roles in the development of the root nodule symbiosis between the bacteria and legumes, particularly at the level of nodule invasion. Several interesting questions remain to be answered, including: under what environmental conditions are the different forms of the symbiotically active exopolysaccharides produced and how the production of these different forms are regulated and coordinated in the symbiont. The answers to these and related questions will lead to a greater understanding of the signaling mechanisms between symbiotic partners and the use of carbohydrates as signals. Further analyses of the functions of exopolysaccharides in the S. meliloti/Medicago sativa symbiosis may also provide insight into the possible uses of oligosaccharides as signaling molecules in other biological systems.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will continue its multiple outreach activities, including among others, a Sinorhizobium project teaching laboratory, a lecture series to minority students and a collaboration project between the Dallas area science museums and the University of Texas at Dallas."

Whereas lead normally constitutes about 0.002 percent of the Earth's crust, in cities, soil lead levels can be from five to 25 times as great.  The heightened presence of lead translates into significantly increased exposure to lead contamination among urban residents, especially children.  The average background lead level of the U.S. population is 2.8 micrograms per deciliter, but in many cities, substantial numbers of children have baseline blood lead levels in excess of 10 micrograms per deciliter.  This research project will develop new methods for exploring spatial dimensions of pediatric lead poisoning.  A multidisciplinary investigative team will study spatial relationships among urban environmental contaminants, the biogeochemical processes of their origin in soils and dust, and the potential for adverse public health risks associated with human exposure to them.  A primary goal of this project is to quantitatively assess the community health risks associated with exposure to soils and interior household dusts that have been contaminated by heavy metals.  A second major goal is to determine the feasibility of carrying out such assessments through the use of non-intrusive, ecological techniques.  To accomplish these goals, the investigators will develop a geography-based lead-exposure assessment model for Syracuse, New York.  Inputs to this model will be the blood lead monitoring results, population and housing census data, heavy-metal measurements for soils and dust, and other georeferenced data.<br/><br/>This research will make a number of contributions to the spatial analysis literature.  For example, it will extend small area estimation techniques to a nesting situation and establish a trade-off curve between effective sample size and accuracy/precision of sample statistics.  It will improve understanding of geographic dimensions of lead dispersal, and it will test new approaches for monitoring contamination.  This project also will have a significant policy impacts for the public health arena.  In particular, it will provide a widely applicable, cost-effective, childhood lead poisoning assessment tool for urban environments; it will foster a geographically explicit interpretive framework for evaluating intervention measures; and it will help contribute to improvements in EPA exposure modeling capabilities.<br/>"

Because cnidarians diverged from the rest of the animals prior to the evolution of organs, their overall anatomy is quite simple. Despite this however, cnidarians have attained incredible diversity, comprising over 11,000 species, many of which display elaborate structures and complex life histories. The lack of organs and other anatomical landmarks has made it difficult for scientists to discern their evolutionary relationships. Recent technological and theoretical advances in the sequencing and analysis of DNA provide the opportunity to use the information encoded within an organism's genetic code to elucidate evolutionary relationships. The primary aim of this proposal is to obtain DNA sequence data from 1,800 cnidarian species: this will generate approximately 23 million base pairs of cnidarian DNA sequence, and the specimens from which the sequences are obtained will be retained in natural history museum collections. The information encoded in the DNA will be used to reconstruct cnidarian phylogenies (evolutionary trees), using computer algorithms and supercomputing facilities. Some of the questions this proposal will address are: Was the ancestor to all of cnidarians solitary or colonial? Are jellyfish or hydras more closely related to the corals? How and when did coral skeletons evolve? What are the evolutionary transitions between a simple hydra polyp and a complex Portuguese Man-of-War colony? Reconstructing a cnidarian evolutionary tree is important for our understanding of the patterns and processes that accompanied the early diversification of animal life. <br/><br/><br/><br/>        Formal and informal education will result from this research. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars, including those belonging to groups under-represented in the sciences, will be trained. A symposium on cnidarian evolutionary relationships will be organized by the investigators at a national scientific meeting. A Cnidaria Tree of Life database will be developed to include outreach and learning components such as images, common names, and keys designed to appeal to students at all levels as well as interested users such as divers and aquarists. Museum exhibits will be created based on research results, one at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum, and one, entitled ""Cnidarian Diversity in the Oceans"" that will be part of the new Oceans Hall, due to open at the National Museum of Natural History in 2008. A website and classroom poster (in both English and Spanish) integrated with the latter exhibit will be created in collaboration with a K-12 educator supported through NSF's Research Experience for Teachers program. <br/><br/><br/>"

Thus, they are Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems that integrate sensing with modeling in an adaptive framework. Keen interest in broad application of wireless sensing of the environment, as in NEON and CLEANER, awaits DDDAS technology that can estimate the value of future data in terms of its contribution to understanding against the costs of deployment, acquisition, transmission, and storage. This balance is especially important for environmental data, because networks will typically be deployed in remote locations without access to infrastructure (e.g., power), and sampling intervals will range from meters and seconds to landscapes and years, depending on the process, the current state of the system, the uncertainty about that state, and the perceived potential for rapid change. Network control must be dynamic and driven by models capable of learning about both the environment and the network.  The focus of this project is the  dynamic sensor network application involving understanding how biodiversity and carbon storage are influenced by global change. Specifically, this project is designed to learn how the growth, survival, and reproduction of forest trees are influenced by changes in climate, CO2 and disturbance, in the context of these and other variables that can fluctuate rapidly. This goal involves models of how tree growth and resource allocation are influenced by variables that can be understood through adaptive sampling across diverse scales in both time and space.  The project will enable a general framework for dynamic data-driven wireless network control that combines environmental modeling and sensor network modeling both in and out of the network. Out of the network, environmental modeling entails full assimilation of all information, with exploitation of computing resources available there. Environmental modeling in the network is based on simplified representations that provide real-time, approximate answers. The in-network control model provides rapid scheduling for new measurements, and it communicates network information to the server, for diagnostics, supervisory control, and data assimilation. Periodically, the in-network model is updated based on this most complete understanding of the environmental variables, parameters, and battery life. Specific goals are (i) to construct a wireless sensing and networking infrastructure that supports a new paradigm of joint in-network and supervisory measurement, modeling, and prediction, (ii) to develop the modeling strategy needed to combine system understanding with costs for efficient wireless sensing of the environment, (iii) to make significant progress in understanding the maintenance of biodiversity and in measuring ecosystem properties, and (iv) to improve collaboration between computer sciences, engineering, statisticians and environmental scientists.<br/><br/>"

The broad goal of the research is to link aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems through element analysis. Acquisition of the combustion element analyzer will allow for analysis of C/N ratios of sediment organic matter, helping to distinguish terrestrial vs. aquatic sources. The element analyzer in combination with the upgraded automated sampler/dilutor will allow for continued work in Minnesota and Manitoba and expansion of this work to include sediments collected in western Mongolia. A second set of projects will focus on integrating the theory on food web structure, nutrient spiraling and ecological stoichiometry in stream ecosystems of northern California. Ecologists have long been interested in the influence of communities of organisms on fluxes of C, N, and P. Ecological stoichiometry theory provides a framework for the study of nutrient fluxes through food webs and the influence of food web structure on transport and retention of multiple nutrients.

This interaction requires an exquisite degree of coordination, often under extremely complex conditions, and we are only just beginning to understand how such coordination is achieved. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Sternad will examine the performance of a perceptual-motor task in which the complex coordination of actor and environment is distilled in a paradigm suitable for research.  The task is the rhythmic bouncing of a ball with a racket. In this task, the actor must continuously coordinate the movements of the racket with the movements of the ball, whose trajectories are in turn determined by the actor. This advantage of this task is that the resulting ball-racket system obeys well-understood physical principles.  Moreover, by virtue of being a definable nonlinear dynamical system, it displays characteristic features such as stability and bifurcations. By manipulating the racket, the actor becomes part of this dynamical system and can exploit its properties. Some regimes of the system offer rhythmic solutions with ""passive stability"", where perturbations converge back onto the attractor without requiring corrective control. Other regimes require active control on the part of actor. Establishing, maintaining, and tuning the regimes of active control rely upon multiple sources of perceptual information. One of the primary aims of this research is to better understand these two general regimes of coordination. The research will also establish national and international collaborations in which both senior investigators and graduate students will participate.<br/>"

This is achieved through realistic video and sound reconstruction of the activities in three-dimensional (3D) space in real time. Several components of these tele-immersive environments need to be in place to achieve seamless immersive experience: (a) set of cameras covering the 360 degree space in which the activity is taking place, hence creating 3D data sets, (b) sound system recovering sound from 360 degrees without echo, (c) broadband networking technology that enables throughput of large data sets across geographically distributed sites (end-to-end) with minimal latency and synchronous delivery, and (d) display technologies to display data from different sites in a consistent fashion. Many components of the tele-immersive environments have been developed, and preliminary small scale experiments with individual and customized components have been performed. <br/><br/>What is missing is a holistic deployment and experimentation with the current existing tele- immersive components. In this one-year project, we aim to (1) integrate current COTS components that are available on the market for tele-immersive environments, such as the current 3D cameras, wireless sound system, Internet2 protocols, and existing plasma and projector-type displays, (2) deploy the integrated COTS components at two geographically distributed sites, UC Berkeley and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and (3) test and execute preliminary experiments with our holistic integrated system, called Tele-immersive Environment for EVErybody (TEEVE). This integration and deployment will present very unique results because they will enable testing of the existing COTS components and their capabilities and limitations to deliver cutting-edge technology to broader audience. We expect also that the integration and deployment will reveal future research challenges since we plan to perform extensive experimental analysis of the TEEVE system. Our experimental analysis will span from network-based measurements where we plan to measure and evaluate accomplished bandwidth across Internet2 when sending large number of audio and video streams, accomplished latency, jitter, loss rate, response time, compression ratio on real-time 3D data, vision-based measurements where we plan to measure the correctness of existing 3D reconstruction algorithms in terms of semantics and real-time behavior, to user-based measurements where we plan to experiment with the tai-chi teacher at the UC Berkeley side and question students at the UIUC side about their experience versus using a standard video tape.<br/><br/>The intellectual Merit rests in (1) the extensive integration of COTS components which will consider and analyze the multiple configurations and synchronization mechanisms possible in our multi-tier system, (2) the deployment and experimentation with the integrated system, measuring the various metrics at different system/user levels, and (3) integration guidelines and setup methodologies how to put together such a holistic tele-immersive infrastructure like TEEVE. Experiences and experimental results will be shared with the research community in the form of documentation, software, and tutorial(s) at conferences such as ACM Multimedia, IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) and others.<br/><br/>Broader impacts will derive from the fact that will be the first holistic deployment of an affordable tele-immersive Internet-based infrastructure. TEEVE is the first step to allow sharing of activities that require full body visual and auditory information across geographically distributed sites.

In this project we explore how to directly support this partnership through the cyberinfrastructure. There are challenges: scientists and developers each have their own technical languages; they use hard-to-capture computational artifacts such as data and program; they have differing notions of the value of tool reuse; and collaboration is often triggered by crisis rather than opportunity. The cyberinfrastructure can radically improve interdisciplinary collaboration, limiting the need for individuals to invest in extensive cross-training and curbing ad-hoc, error-prone solutions. In this project we are synthesizing and evaluating a demonstration cyberinfrastructure endowed with a core set of collaborative supports designed to engender impromptu, highly productive exchanges that result in well-informed, high-quality, reusable computational tools.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. A particularly promising approach for supporting collaboration between scientists and software developers is ""participatory programming,"" a variant of participatory design in which developers iteratively refine their solutions with direct input from scientists. We are exploring a new form of embedded participatory programming that moves the participatory experience directly into the cyberinfrastructure. This approach involves the ability to manipulate domain-specific computational artifacts, tight integration with existing research and communications tools, and the reliable persistence of both finished and intermediate artifacts. <br/><br/>To test and refine our approach, we are simulating scientific explorations in the field of bioscience that are supported by a demonstration cyberinfrastructure featuring embedded participatory programming. We are employing a hothouse approach that compresses typical time scales for emergent collaboration by simulating critical periods in a scientific exploration over the course of a few weeks. To focus our energies on issues of collaboration instead of high-fidelity tool building, simulation participants are graduate students and advanced high school students studying biology and computer science.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The expected impact of this proposed work is the demonstration of a compelling vision of the collaborative culture needed to unlock the full potential of the cyberinfrastructure. We anticipate that our work will yield validated design principles for collaboration supports that will inform the appropriate development of the cyberinfrastructure and the suitable training of scientists and developers who will use it. The University of Colorado Science Discovery program  (a network of 32,000 students and 1,600 teachers statewide) and the Shodor Foundation plan to adopt the curriculum and tools from our simulated scientific explorations for future summer programs and teacher professional development.<br/>"

Ecologists have also examined the effects of hurricanes on aquatic systems (Valiela et al., 1996; Paerl et al., 2003), but no previous studies have focused on bacterial dynamics that may occur in response to hurricanes. This proposal focuses on bacterial dynamics for basic ecological reasons, but also because of human health concerns. There are already signs that the bacterial responses are important and large in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Especially there is a threat from infectious disease also includes the virulent pathogen, Vibrio vulnificans. This pathogen is endemic in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Kelly, 1982), and appears responsible for several fatalities in areas effected by Hurricane Katrina.<br/><br/>In this study, we propose to sample the waters overlying and adjoining New Orleans, to quantify the effects of Hurricane Katrina on this critical system. We will analyze bacterial community structure by analysis of terminal restriction fragment polymorphisms   (TRFLP) of PCR-amplified ribosomal genes. The TRFLPs we generate will allow us to identify the dominant bacteria in this system and quantify the relative contribution of feces to the microbiota.

The CI-Team plans an ambitious use of cyber-collaboration and education technologies to prototype a set of core courses in a curriculum for ""Engineering Informatics"" that spans our institutions and unites computer and information sciences with traditional engineering domains.<br/><br/>The team is a highly inter-disciplinary group from four universities consisting of computer scientists and engineers with the complimentary expertise needed to create both the shared model and the educational deliverables.  The scientific challenge to the team is to produce an engineering model that integrates semantic descriptions of robotic components, behavioral and simulation software, software for snake robot control and navigation, as well as the tools needed to perform analysis, component surrogation and mission assessment.  The educational challenge is to develop course materials that are both multi-disciplinary and scientifically rich.  The goal is to educate students so they can span and integrate disciplines: semantics, engineering modeling, and computational tools.  This project will deeply connect different sub-fields of engineering and computer science, enabling the new inter-disciplinary trained engineers to rapidly create new snake-inspired robot designs. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: This project contributes to the transformation of engineering into an ""informatics"" discipline and broadens the interface between computer science and engineering.

Even though these same resources are available on the Internet, 21st century science has not yet found its way into the high school science classroom.  In order to prepare the next generation of scientists, engineers and mathematicians and a science-literate workforce, it is imperative that we begin to empower teachers to take advantage of cyberinfrastructure resources to enable 21st century research techniques and collaborative science in their classrooms.  The Strategic Technology Astronomy Research Team (START) Collaboratory is a Web-based national astronomy research collaboratory that is being created under a three-year NSF-STI grant (PN #0334168) to provide high school students with integrated access to national astronomy databases, tools and resources available on the cyberinfrastructure. The two-year CI-TEAM demonstration project will show how the START Collaboratory can be used to bring 21st century research techniques made possible by the cyberinfrastructure into high school classrooms through a face-to-face and an online teacher professional development program that includes follow-up online mentoring and support for teachers and their students. The Adler Planetarium joins the START Collaboratory team - Hands On Universe at the University of California at Berkeley, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at Johns Hopkins University, and the Northwestern University Collaboratory Project - to create and offer the professional development programs. Teachers will learn to engage and support their students in 21st century astronomy research by first exploring these new research techniques themselves while being mentored online and collaborating with other participants and remote experts in the START Collaboratory.  The first year will focus on experienced high school teachers who are already working with their students on astronomy research.  Year two will bring in Chicago-area high school science teachers half of whom will be drawn from the Chicago Public Schools with a focus on increasing minority participation. These teachers may have an interest in astronomy, but little research experience or specific astronomy content knowledge.  At the conclusion of this two-year demonstration project, the Adler Planetarium and Hands On Universe will integrate the face-to-face and online workshops into their programs.  The workshops and START Collaboratory will be available to other organizations to adopt.

If this can be done, UHECR detection will be possible over much larger detection areas, facilitating the collection of many more events, and be more cost efficient. These rarely occurring, mysterious high-energy particles have been detected, but no one is able to explain their nature and origin, and have been identified as a high priority area of national research. The quest for the detection and understanding of the nature and origin of UHECR may lead to a deeper understanding of how the Universe works. MARIACHI is revolutionary not only for being on the forefront of cosmic ray detection techniques, but also for its incorporation of a diverse group of scientists, educators, and students in a large cyberinfrastructure collaboration for the support of its cutting-edge research.  MARIACHI intrinsically promotes and advances physics research and information technology education, since a major component of the project is scientifically dependent upon detectors built and operated by high schools and community colleges to confirm the observation of UHECR signals.  Widespread detection sites, tied together by modern cyberinfrastructure, i.e. grid computing, allow for MARIACHI's data collection, and expose a broad range of individuals and organizations to exciting physics research and modern scientific and computing tools, thus providing an opportunity that they would otherwise be unable to experience.  MARIACHI enables participants to build, deploy, utilize, and apply the most current information technologies through collaborative efforts with scientists active in this forefront research, and consequently it encourages and prepares a strong future workforce in cyberinfrastructure and research fields. The present grant will be used to implement a pilot program that can eventually be implemented nationwide due to the scalability of its design. Progress and results of this project will be showcased in a publicly accessible website. <br/>"

As a cornerstone of this effort, a Grid-enabled application, CH3D-GTM, which applies the robust shallow water estuarine model CH3D to the Guana<br/>Tolomato Matanzas (GTM) National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR), is used to demonstrate and teach CI concepts to a diverse audience. At the GTM Environmental Education Center, personnel and student fellows are trained, and educational programs are developed to reach K-20 students, teachers and the general public.  At the State of Florida's St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD), scientists and engineers are trained on how to deploy models using the CH3D-GTM application as a tutorial. At the University of Florida in Gainesville (UF), faculty and students develop curriculum content based on Grid middleware to teach students how to use, support, deploy, develop and design the CH3D-GTM application and similar simulation models. <br/><br/>This project focuses on workforce development for current scientists and engineers, as well as for future practitioners. In the short term, NERR educators and student fellows and SJRWMD engineers and researchers are being trained, and at least three graduate engineering courses at UF are being enhanced. The long-term goal is to make a significant contribution towards a national CI for science, government and public use. The improved simulation capabilities could then translate into improved ecosystem-based water quality and resource management, emergency preparedness and response, and planned development for these heavily populated and vulnerable regions.  <br/><br/>While focused on the CES community, the training methods, materials and software are conceived such that they can be generalized to other application domains and reused in other regions of the country.  Outreach activities further broaden the scope of this project by bringing basic CES and CI concepts to K-20 teachers and students that routinely visit the GTM in field trips.

There are two types of IRC systems: routing overlays and intelligent multihoming. First, IRC systems perform load-sensitive routing, allowing dynamic path changes based on the measured performance of candidate paths. Second, with IRC systems it becomes possible to route different classes of traffic to the same destination through different paths. Third, IRC systems give edge networks the flexibility to choose their path to common destinations.<br/><br/>This project investigates IRC systems from a critical perspective, examining both their potential to improve network routing and application performance, but also the risk that such systems may introduce in the Internet in the form of instability and conflicting routing incentives. The project's main research tasks are to: investigate both routing overlays and intelligent multihoming and compare the pros and cons of the two architectures; identify the key issues in the design and operation of IRC systems; design algorithms and mechanisms for the stable and efficient operation of IRC Systems; evaluate the previous results through realistic simulations and wide-scale experiments over Planetlab and other testbeds.<br/><br/>The final outcome of this project will be a coherent set of designs and algorithms for IRC systems, considering both performance and stability, and focusing not only on the incentives of individual players but also on the global utility of the Internet as a whole. The project can have a significant impact on the design and deployment of IRC systems. The project's results will be disseminated through research publications, and through direct communication with manufacturers of IRC systems and network operators.<br/>"

One mass spectrometer will be dedicated to measurements of natural isotopic variations in krypton and xenon, which should reveal the thickness of past ""convective zones"" in polar firn, as well as improving temperature change estimates made from trapped air in ice. The second mass spectrometer will be specially designed to measure neon isotopes and neon/xenon ratios in dual-collector mode which will enable monitoring of this ratio in the atmosphere, which should rise due to current ocean warming and consequent outgassing.  Past variations in atmospheric Kr/N2 and Xe/N2 from ice core gases will also provide an average-ocean-temperature estimate over the past million years due to the solubility differences in these gases. Neon isotopes will shed light on fractionation processes during bubble close-off in polar ice, as well as the mechanism of supersaturation in seawater and groundwater. Neon/argon ratios in seawater as a tracer of sea ice formation by brine rejection will also be explored.  .  The broader impacts of the proposed acquisition are that education and training will be enhanced since graduate students will be among the primary users of the equipment. Outreach activities involving polar ice cores and climate change will be enhanced. These facilities will be available widely to others at the Institution for collaborative projects and will enhance the capabilities of Scripps and position it for a leadership role in environmental noble gas geochemistry."

Teams of experts have made significant discoveries over the past 20 years as a result of rapidly deployed reconnaissance activities that have ensured that perishable data was appropriately collected and archived.  The resulting information has also formed the basis for numerous detailed ""follow-on"" investigations. <br/><br/>Conducting reconnaissance at post-disaster sites is not with challenge.  Whether the disaster is a natural event (e.g. earthquake, tsunami, tornado, fire, hurricane) or a man-induced one (e.g. terrorist attack), individuals conducting reconnaissance are often placed in situations of elevated hazard due to follow-on events (after-shocks), delayed collapse (structures weakened during initial event), health issues (loss of sanitation) or simply breakdown of law and order.  As a result, there is an increased potential for data quality and quantity to be compromised as individuals work under more challenging conditions.  One factor that can minimize the impact of these adverse conditions is to have a robust integrated data collection system that supports the reconnaissance team.  In this manner, individuals participating in field studies can record information more rapidly. By capturing the data directly in digital format, field team members can also share it more effectively with other team members located at remote low hazard environments.  Against this backdrop of technology assisted field data collection, this project will deploy a multi-disciplinary team using state of the art handheld technology to collect damage assessment data at various locations along the Gulf Coast following the recent Hurricane Katrina event.  The primary reconnaissance objective that underpins this project is field studies to develop a baseline condition model for a major port facility subjected to a catastrophic event.  Additional objectives focus on evaluating multi-scale geographic variations in infrastructure damage as a result of hurricane storm surge and wind. <br/><br/>Data that documents physical damage to the port infrastructure will be correlated with the reduced operational capacity of the port.  Discussions with port officials will identify the key operational data and performance metrics that define port functionality.  This may include, for example, numbers of ships processed at different berths, total tonnage unloaded and loaded, total cargo value unloaded and loaded, number of containers unloaded, loaded and stored, gate inbound and outbound movements, and yard handling movements.  As necessary, statistical techniques will be used to extract value from data that only provides partial information.  The project team will also collect information on the impact that other factors (e.g. the welfare and safety of the labor force, damage to the local housing stock, direct and indirect effects of emergency response management, and coordination with government entities at local, state and federal levels) have on the operational capacity of the port.  This information will include mapping who is involved in port operations decision-making, and eliciting stakeholders' characterizations of port management and operations before and after hurricane Katrina.  Questions will include the tenure and turnover of port staff, who is involved in making specific day-to-day and strategic decisions in the port, how communications are being managed, and the status of public-private collaborations.  Findings will inform models of disaster response, public-private partnerships, and stakeholder roles in decision making.<br/><br/>A multi-disciplinary team with significant prior experience in post-disaster reconnaissance including Loma Prieta, Northridge, Kocaeli, Bhuj, WTC, Chi-Chi, Indonesia and Africa has been convened.  Team leaders will work with multi-disciplinary groups of individuals with expertise targeted to the project tasks.  The schedule for the various reconnaissance activities will be mandated by the degree to which the desired data is perishable (very high - high) and the ability to gain access to critical locations.  It is anticipated that all phases of the reconnaissance work will be completed within about 6 weeks.  The primary project deliverable will be a comprehensive multi-scale geo-referenced database of hurricane damage.  The budget includes travel and per diem costs principally.  The intellectual merit of the activity is that it merges the broader objective of enhancing field data collection through the use of integrated digital technology systems with a set of focused technical objectives including port facility condition, storm surge and wind damage, and distributed infrastructure damage, each of which depend on the timely collection of perishable data.  The broader impacts of the activity are embedded in both the study plan and the personnel that will execute it in that a racially and gender diverse multi-disciplinary team that will include both senior and junior faculty and students who will seek to secure rich data sets that can have significant implications for studies, not only into future hurricane preparedness, but also into the consequences of other catastrophic natural events such earthquakes and tsunamis, as well as man-induced (terrorist) disasters. <br/>"

The Nano Bionix has a broad sensitivity that allows it characterize the material properties of large fibers such as alpaca hair, as well as thin fibers such as spider silk, and even some nanoscale electrospun fibers. Furthermore, the Nano Bionix offers the novel capability of Continuous Dynamic Analysis, which measures changes in how fibers store and release energy as they are stretched. Finally, the Nano Bionix system offers the ability to manipulate both temperature and humidity during testing. While a few tensile testers offer thermal control, this is the first system to allow for simultaneous testing of both hydro and thermal effects on the material properties of fibers. Together, these features make the described Nano Bionix system a highly integrated package that will greatly expand the research capacity of The University of Akron and the surrounding research communities.<br/>  Acquisition of this test system will have a variety of broader impacts upon research and education at the University of Akron and surrounding institutions. Tensile testing is a critical tool for biological materials research, engineering, physics, polymer chemistry, and textiles. Thus, this system has the potential to foster a variety of interdisciplinary research programs at The University of Akron. In particular, understanding the mechanical performance and molecular structure of spider silks is of great interest to members of both the Departments of Biology and of Polymer Science. Thus, the Nano Bionix will create a foundation for collaborative research on these biological super fibers. The unique combination of capabilities offered by the Nano Bionix system will also benefit a variety of researchers from surrounding institutions for projects including nanocomposite fibers, natural and synthetic textiles, and biological materials. Thus, the system will serve to strengthen collaborative relationships among institutions in a part of the United State that has historically played an important role in the development and production of a variety of manmade polymer materials. <br/> The Nano Bionix operates with an exceptionally easy user interface. This makes the system a very practical tool for use by undergraduate and graduate students. Thus, the Nano Bionix will help to train students in biomechanics and materials science, preparing them for a variety of careers in research and industry. It will also facilitate the development of an inquiry based laboratory exercise for introductory biology students that focuses upon spider silk biomechanics. Many of the proposed research projects that would utilize the Nano Bionix have close ties to industry or technology such that students involved in those projects will gain first hand exposure to the essential relationship that basic scientific research has with human progress. More than half of these students, within the Department of Biology, are women and over 30% are underrepresented minorities. Thus, this Nano Bionix test system will foster the twin goals of providing a unique enhancement to northeastern Ohio's research infrastructure and of educating students in a dynamic, interdisciplinary environment.  <br/>"

The network will be located on the two adjacent campuses of the University of Cincinnati, which are situated between two major interstate highways and surrounded by local roads. Several stationary sources of air pollutants also are located in the vicinity of the network site. The targeted pollutants are NOx and ozone. Wireless sensors for these constituents will be constructed by integrating gas detectors with signal converters and transmitters linked to data aggregators that will pass the data to a central controller. Issues of sampling frequency, sensor maintenance, data processing, transfer, querying, and scalability will be studied to ensure effective functioning of the network and the production of meaningful data. This research has the potential to positively influence the further development of air quality monitoring networks and promote the use of mobile sensors in new application areas. The proposed sensor network will serve as a model for networks in heavily impacted urban areas and provide useful information for designing and deploying other types of environmental observing networks.

This requires dynamic integration of time-varying measurements of flow, pressure and contaminant concentration with analytical modules including models to simulate the state of the system, statistical methods for adaptive sampling, and optimization methods to search for efficient control strategies. For realistic distribution systems, the analytical modules are highly compute-intensive, requiring multi-level parallel processing via computer clusters. While data often drive the analytical modules, data needs for improving the accuracy and certainty of the solutions generated by these modules dynamically change when a contamination event unfolds. Since such time-sensitive threat events require real-time responses, the computational needs must also be adaptively matched with available resources. Thus, a software system is needed to facilitate this integration via a high-performance computing architecture (e.g., the TeraGrid) such that the measurement system, the analytical modules and the computing resources can mutually adapt and steer each other. The goal of this multi-disciplinary research is to develop a cyberinfrastructure system that will both adapt to and control changing needs in data, models, computer resources and management choices facilitated by a dynamic workflow design. Using virtual simulation and a field study, this cyberinfrastructure will be tested on illustrative scenarios for adaptive management of contamination events in water distribution systems.<br/><br/>Urban water distribution systems are vulnerable to accidental and intentional contamination incidents that could result in adverse human health and safety impacts.  The pipe network in a typical municipal distribution system includes redundant flow paths to ensure service when parts of the network are unavailable, and is designed with significant storage to deliver water during daily peak demand periods.   Thus, a typical network is highly interconnected and experiences significant and frequent fluctuations in flows and transport paths.  These design features unintentionally enable contamination at a single point in the system to spread rapidly via different pathways through the network, unbeknown to consumers and operators. When a contamination event is detected via the first line of defense, e.g., data from a water quality surveillance sensor network and reports from consumers, the municipal authorities are faced with several critical questions as the contamination event unfolds: Where is the source of contamination? When and for how long did this contamination occur? Where additional hydraulic or water quality measurements should be taken to pinpoint the source more accurately? What is the current and near future extent of contamination? What response action, such as shutting down portions of the network, implementing hydraulic control strategies, or introducing decontaminants, should be taken to minimize the impact of the contamination event? What would be the impact on consumers by these actions? Real-time answers to such complex questions will present significant computational challenges.  This project will address these challenges by developing an adaptive cyberinfrastucture that will enable real-time processing and control through dynamic integration of computational components and real-time sensor data. This system will be evaluated using contamination scenarios based on field-scale data from a large metropolitan area.<br/>"

Risks associated with debris can potentially impact both social and technological systems and must therefore be managed as part of debris removal operations. When debris-inducing disasters occur in a built environment, there may be challenges related to the placement and use of debris removal equipment and personnel. Communications and computing technology is now widely deployed to support response personnel during cleanup operations. Yet despite ongoing improvements in CCT, disasters continue to present response personnel with unique problems, at times requiring them to take on new or expanded roles and to develop new plans under tight time pressure. To enable effective use of available communications and computing technology in such circumstances, it is advisable to have heuristics that can support response personnel in deciding which technologies are most appropriate for supporting response activities. <br/><br/>To this end, this study will observe and develop recommendations on the use of communications and computing technology (CCT) in support of debris removal operations following a large-scale disaster. The study's main intellectual merit is in testing the adequacy of task-technology fit theory, which specifies the types of technologies that are best suited to supporting various types of tasks. Theory testing will be accomplished through observational study of CCT use during debris removal operations associated with Hurricane Katrina, and through a comparison of the results of this study to a similar one on debris removal operations at Ground Zero following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. The broader impacts of this work include the development of theoretically-grounded recommendations on how CCT might better support debris removal operations following large-scale disasters. The data collection methodology is also expected to result in documentation of a number of innovations from the field, thus contributing to engineering practice. The resulting understanding should lead to advances in how CCT may be used to support organizations in preparing for, managing and learning from large-scale debris removal operations.<br/><br/><br/>"

The project is motivated by recent theoretical advances that revealed a number of new effects and regimes in porous media combustion, such as low-velocity (subsonic) detonation, deflagration to detonation transitions, and various types of instabilities.  This work studies a model for combustion in porous media consisting of three degenerate parabolic equations for temperature, concentration of the deficient reactant, and pressure.  The project investigates the long-time behavior of the combustion fronts, their stability, and bounds on propagation velocity.  Stability will be explored by a combination of numerical and analytical tools.  The project also studies the so-called high activation energy limit, as well as the transition from slowly propagating deflagration to detonation.  <br/><br/>Premixed gas combustion is the combustion of gaseous reactants that are perfectly mixed prior to ignition.  The most distinctive feature of premixed combustion is its ability to assume a self-sustained reaction front propagating subsonically or supersonically at a well-defined speed.  Combustion fronts constitute a truly fascinating dynamical system, displaying an amazingly rich variety of phenomena, such as non-uniqueness of possible propagation regimes, their birth (ignition) and destruction (extinction), chaotic self-motion and fractal-like growth, and various hysteretic transitions.  The current project is concerned with the mathematical analysis of combustion front dynamics in a porous medium, involving evaluation of the propagation velocity, its limits, stability, and the transition from deflagrative to detonative combustion.  The results of the work have potential application to engineering design of propulsion systems.<br/>"

The fauna of the Southern Ocean has evolved under stable, cold temperatures for approximately 14 million years. These conditions have led to the evolution of unusual physiological and biochemical characteristics, many of which may reflect adaptations to relatively low oxygen availability and high larval oxygen demands. The goal of the proposed projects is to understand latitudinal variation in the function of invertebrate egg masses in relation to oxygen availability and temperature. This relationship is critical to larval survival in the low-temperature, high-oxygen conditions found at high latitudes. In particular, the investigators will: (1) use first principles to model the diffusion of oxygen into egg and embryo masses of Antarctic organisms at environmentally relevant temperatures; (2) test model assumptions by measuring the temperature-dependence of embryonic metabolism and oxygen diffusivity through natural and artificial gels; (3) test model predictions by using oxygen microelectrodes to measure oxygen gradients in both artificial and natural egg masses, and by measuring developmental rates of embryos at different positions in masses; and (4) compare the structure and function of egg masses from the Southern Ocean to those from temperate waters.  These components of the study constitute an integrated examination of the evolutionary physiology of egg mass structure and function. Studies of masses endemic to polar conditions will increase the understanding of egg mass evolution across equator-to-pole gradients in temperature and across gradients in oxygen partial pressure. The proposal will support graduate students and will involve several undergraduates in research. The PIs will also design and implement units on polar biology for undergraduate classes at their respective institutions. These educational units will focus on the PIs' photographs, video footage, experiments, and data from this project. The PIs will use web-linked video and instructional technologies to design and co-teach a new class on polar ecological physiology, will work with local grade school institutions to involve high school students in research, and will develop high school course modules about polar biology."

The transfer of dissolved gases across the air/water interface of freshwater lakes is critical to numerous ecosystems.  Protection of these ecosystems requires an understanding of this interfacial gas exchange problem.  While there is a large body of research on gas exchange across air/water interfaces at the high wind speed conditions typical of oceans, little has been done to study the low wind speed conditions that are common on lakes.  The proposed research seeks to address this critical need, focusing on the transport of dissolved gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, under low wind speed conditions where both forced convection and natural convection play a role; a transport regime referred to as mixed convection.  This research will also focus on how gas transfer is affected by the single molecule thick organic films called 'surfactant monolayers', which are ubiquitous on lakes.  The research will consist of a set of laboratory experiments utilizing a wind/water tunnel where the transfer of dissolved gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide will be measured as a function of wind speed and air-water temperature difference.  The effect of surfactant contamination on transport will be quantified by introducing these surfactants on the water surface in a controlled fashion.  The fluid flow structures responsible for the observed gas exchange phenomena will be investigated using flow visualization techniques, including infrared imaging of the water surface and laser induced fluorescence imaging of the subsurface flow.

Boyce for partial support of the acquisition of an element analyzer for carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur (C, H, N and S). This instrument, with associated equipment for sample preparation, will be used for research in a number of areas in both biology and chemistry.  These include the analysis of C and N in tree foliage for projects conducted in Colorado and Kentucky; the quantity of C and N in potential food resources eaten by tadpoles and the amount they assimilate from the food they eat; the C, N and S content of water and sediment samples from diatom studies being conducted on the Ohio River and from lakes in equatorial South America; the design of fullerene-transition metal dyads and new linear multimetallic chains; and the Bergman cyclization of arenediynes and the incorporation of arenediyenes into novel push-pull annulenes.  <br/><br/>This instrument will be used to train a number of undergraduate students each year.  As Northern Kentucky University is primarily an undergraduate institution, and none of the PIs are in departments with graduate programs, all of these studies involve and train undergraduates.  The speed and safety of the element analyzer will allow the PIs to involve even more undergraduates in research.  It is anticipated that this instrument will be used in the chemistry and biology upper-division courses. <br/><br/>Acquisition of this instrument will allow Northern Kentucky University to involve more women and members of under-represented groups in research.  The majority of biology and chemistry majors at Northern Kentucky University are first-generation university students.  More than half of the biology and chemistry majors are involved in research; this instrument will allow the university to train even more of these under-represented groups in research, thus building the research infrastructure of the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region.  Acquisition of this equipment will also allow the PIs to carry out aspects of their research that cannot be done at present, as current instrumentation does not analyze C and is too slow for the volume of samples generated by these studies.  <br/>"

Health inequalities are particularly important in rapidly growing cities of the developing world, where some people enjoy significant health improvements because of access to environmental technologies and health services. Conversely, health outcomes and health risks for the residents of urban slums may be similar to, or worse than, those for residents of poor rural areas, as they are exposed to environmental risks both at home and due to neighborhood pollution. Air pollution exposure in urban areas may be caused by smoke from household energy use for cooking and heating, and by ambient air pollution from transportation and industrial activities and infrastructure.<br/><br/>We will measure the distribution of exposure to air pollution, and estimate the resulting impacts on health outcomes in Accra, a growing urban center where biomass fuel use is still common. Accra provides a unique setting for understanding of how energy technology and infrastructure influence urban environmental and health inequalities. The population of Accra Metropolitan Area increased from 600,000 in 1970 to 1.7 million in 2000. There is substantial variation in socioeconomic status, housing, and urban infrastructure between the high-income areas, the crowded slums, and the older inner core areas. Nearly 60% of Accra's population relies on charcoal or firewood as the primary source of household energy. Persisting high levels of household exposure to environmental risks associated with poverty are coupled with increases in exposures associated with urban ambient pollution sources, such as old imported vehicles, and industrial activity in micro-enterprises within the city and in up-wind industrial sites outside the city. <br/><br/>This research will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team of investigators from health, physical, and social sciences and engineering. We will use the techniques and methods of multiple disciplines to measure air pollution exposure in subgroups of the city's population, at a level of detail which is rare in previous studies. We will integrate these measurements with methods from epidemiology and econometrics to understand the resulting effects of air pollution exposure on health inequalities. We will apply the specific findings locally to help design programs and policies for better management of air pollution in Accra. In addition, both the methodology and the results can be applied to other cities, to understand the air pollution and health inequality consequences of urban infrastructure and energy policy in a broader context. <br/><br/>Beyond the scientific benefits and applications to more effective management of technologies for reducing air pollution and health inequalities, the project will contribute to the development of educational opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, as well as those seeking professional training. The educational component will focus both on methodology and on the scientific and policy applications of the findings of the study. The project will also establish strong links between faculty and students from Harvard University and the University of Ghana, creating learning and research opportunities.<br/><br/>This project is supported by an award made in  the FY 2005 competition in the Human and Social Dynamics priority area. All NSF directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards."

The program builds on a successful partnership between Harvard's Teacher Education Program (TEP) and the Boston Public Schools.  TEP is an eleven-month graduate program that leads to a Master's in Education and initial teacher certification. College graduates who have majored in STEM disciplines are being actively recruited for Noyce scholarships by offering a rigorous and supportive pre-service teacher education program.  Noyce Scholars are being trained to teach a standards-based math and science curriculum. TEP is awarding 14 Noyce scholarships each year for three years. As part of their training, Noyce Scholars complete a yearlong, mentored internship in a Boston middle or high school. During their first year of teaching after graduating from TEP, the Scholars return to Harvard for monthly seminars led by experts in mathematics and science. The intellectual merit associated with this project reflects a growing body of research suggesting that the crisis of math and science teacher shortages in urban districts cannot be addressed through recruitment incentives alone. In addition to recruiting, this program is also addressing the quality and context of preservice preparation, classroom based support through mentoring, and opportunities for teachers to further their interests through connections with experts in science and mathematics. This project has a broad impact on advancing discovery and understanding in math and science by providing rigorous preparation and support to middle and high school teaching candidates who possess significant expertise in their disciplines. The project is ensuring that students from linguistically and racially diverse low-income communities, who comprise the vast majority of the student body in Boston's public schools and who are critically underrepresented in the fields of math and science, have access to qualified teachers."

Despite the profound impacts these transformations can have on the population's well-being, our knowledge on how to anticipate problems is limited. The existing economic literature on economic growth is mostly conducted at the macro level, which hides significant differential impacts across regions and individuals. Besides, most economic literature focuses on income, thus equating economic well-being with overall well-being. However, recent empirical studies show little relationship between income growth and measures of subjective well-being.  More importantly, most existing studies are single-disciplined, which inhibits the examination of the complex and dynamic relationships among various economic, social and cultural forces that act independently and interactively to impact on the well-being of individuals. This interdisciplinary research project will examine rural to urban migration in China as an agent of change and how that affects a set of complex and dynamic relationships among many economic, social and cultural factors and their effects on the well-being of individuals.  The research uses an integrative framework, with economic theory as a foundation to integrate relevant concepts and findings from other disciplines. This approach takes advantage of the analytical rigor and tractability of economic models plus the contributions of anthropology, sociology and psychology that help us to understand human behavior and social/individual interactions.  An integrated conceptual framework allows for hypotheses-driven data collection and empirical testing, rather than ad hoc statistical associations. Methodologically, a major innovation is the integration of ethnographic studies and household surveys. The investigators will collect data through three methods: pre-survey ethnographic studies to inform the study on hypothesis formulation and design of culturally and socially sensitive survey instruments; household surveys to collect quantitative data; and post-survey ethnography to more fully explore survey findings and provide rich qualitative information for interpreting survey results. In addition, the study design takes advantage of the ""natural experiment"" created by China's entry into WTO (World Trade Organization) and the differential effect it has on various types of agricultural products and the regions that specialize in them. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. The project will contribute to the training of a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers through the involvement of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the planning, implementation, and data analysis phases. The longitudinal data collected as part of the study will also be made available for students, junior researchers and the larger public to conduct research on a number of dynamic relationships among economic, social, cultural changes in rural China and their consequences, and relationships with health and well-being.<br/><br/><br/>"

Haldane), at least an inordinate fondness for the study of this species-rich and life-history diverse lineage of insects. A team led by Dr. Brian Farrell at Harvard University, Dr. Michael Whiting at Brigham Young University, and Dr. David Maddison at the University of Arizona, with colleagues from around the world, will conduct an extensive study of beetle (insect order Coleoptera) phylogeny to provide the first broad scale view of beetle diversification. With ca. 350,000 described species, beetles comprise a huge fraction of the world's biota and are dominant in every terrestrial ecosystem. Beetles represent the most diverse and rapid radiation of any terrestrial organismal group, yet we have only a rudimentary knowledge of their deeper level phylogeny, and still do not understand even their most basic patterns of diversity. Collectively, beetles represent nearly every feeding habit among insects including herbivory and fungivory (feeding upon fungi), saprophagy (feeding upon decaying matter), predation and parasitism, and a thorough study of their evolutionary history would provide insight into the role of feeding habits in species diversity. The team of 40 leading beetle researchers worldwide, with expertise in nearly every beetle lineage, proposes to construct a framework phylogeny (genealogical tree) for all beetles, utilizing a 3-tier approach. Tier 1: 54 exemplar species, representing all major beetle lineages, will be sampled extensively for character data (morphology plus 23kb of DNA sequence data including complete mitochondrial genomes) to provide a robust outline of the relationships among the major (superfamily) groups of beetles.  Tier 2: 300 additional species will sampled for morphology and 12kb of sequence data to establish relationships among beetle families.  Tier 3: 3000 additional species will be sequenced for 1.5 kb of DNA sequence data, with morphology added for a subset of these, to better characterize the grand diversity of beetle phylogeny at the subfamilial level. <br/>Novel bioinformatics tools will be developed to streamline data processing for the molecular and morphological data, and will allow for greater efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility of the data and associated results, while providing an online framework for collaboration by participants throughout the world. This represents the first time that coleopterists have collaborated on such a large-scale phylogenetic project, and the work should result in a robust estimate of beetle phylogeny that will provide a predictive basis for classification and integration of information on this ecologically and economically important group of insects.  Information on all aspects of beetles will be disseminated through the Tree-of-Life website hosted at the University of Arizona, a traveling Spanish-language / English-language museum exhibit, and through publications and symposia.  This research will provide training for graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students, including 10 female researchers and an undergraduate student with disabilities. <br/>"

This project aims to provide empirical evidence on several dimensions of the potential socio-economic and physical consequences of early marriage for women using data from rural Bangladesh. In particular, the PI will explore the commonly cited hypotheses that girls attain less schooling, experience more reproductive health complications, have higher fertility and experience lower levels of gender equality in marriage as a result of marrying young. A novel identification strategy will allow the PI to estimate the causal effect of marriage timing on these outcomes by exploiting variation in the timing of menarche as an instrumental variable for age of first marriage.  Because girls in Bangladesh are typically withheld from the marriage market until the onset of puberty, natural variation in the timing of first menstruation generates quasi-random differences in the earliest age at which girls are at risk of marriage.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. This approach would contribute significantly to the existing literature on marriage institutions in developing countries by generating the first estimates of the causal effect of early marriage on adult outcomes. While statistics indicate that women in early marriages fare worse, it is difficult to assess the extent to which these outcomes are driven by the timing of marriage as opposed to common factors related to poverty and traditional gender views that also hinder female advancement. Hence, although many  theoretical predictions related to marriage age and female welfare are ambiguous, competing hypotheses have not been adequately investigated with empirical tests. For instance, it is unclear whether parents would increase investment in girls' schooling if opportunities for marriage at young ages fall. Similarly, given even partial ability to limit childbearing with contraception, it is ambiguous whether fertility levels would fall significantly with a modest rise in age at marriage. Finally, while researchers have posited that marrying young directly reduces women's bargaining power in marriage, the theoretical predictions are again ambiguous. <br/>Broader Impact. The most important broader impact of estimating the causal influence of marriage timing would be to evaluate and direct policy measures aimed at eradicating child marriage practices, including determining how best to target such policies, and at what minimum age should these policies be enforced. On account of the strong correlations between age of marriage and female welfare, there is presently a great deal of policy focus on instituting effective laws banning adolescent marriage, although the difficulty in enforcing such laws suggests that upholding them would be costly. Meanwhile, the direct effect of early marriage on adult outcomes and hence the expected benefits of enforcing consent laws is not well understood. Only where early marriage is causally related to female outcomes in adulthood is a strong policy focus justified. Furthermore, it is impossible for policy makers to assess which subpopulations lie in the margin of influence for changing marriage practices. Results of the proposed research would shed light on several features of marriage markets in Bangladesh relevant for optimally targeting policy efforts towards ages, family structures and socio-economic groups. Perhaps most importantly, it is likely that most of the benefits<br/>to marriage delay come from postponing marriages below the current age of consent laws. Hence,<br/>legal bans on marriage below 15 or 16 may be comparable in effectiveness and more feasible policy measures in settings in which adolescent marriage is costly to prevent. Similarly, uncovering the<br/>relative burden of particular consequences of marrying young is critical for determining which<br/>complimentary policy measures are needed most in settings in which the practice continues. Through<br/>collaborative efforts with ICDDR,B Centre for Health & Population Research, research findings will<br/>be disseminated directly to local program officials in order to better direct future policy formulation."

In the first study, they will provide samples of new and complex products such as PDA's to a randomly selected group of students. They will use various treatments including print and online advertising to obtain valid instruments for estimating interaction channels. By measuring both initial and final valuations as well as subjects' knowledge about the functionality of each product the research design can separate social learning, whether it be learning from information (strong social learning) or learning from observing friends' valuations (weak social learning), from social influence which changes preferences directly. <br/><br/>In the second learning project the PIs will generate private signals about the quality of four imaginary companies and then observe how subjects aggregate this information in the social network. By using the same subject pool we can further refine our model of social learning.<br/><br/>The last part of this project is a study of trust that will use field experiment techniques in Peru. We measure trust through a new microfinance program where borrowers can obtain low-interest rate loans by finding a sponsor from a predetermined set group of people in the community who are willing to cosign the loan. <br/><br/><br/>This research will help us to better understand how people learn from the experiences of others.  The research design will allow the PIs to break this kind of ""social learning"" into two different pieces by measuring both outcomes and information transmission.

Countries that are not democracies or that are in transition face global pressures to build moderate states via independent, competent judiciaries, to permit the opening of civil society, and to institute and protect core rights against state oppression. These elements of political liberalism are also relevant for mature democracies as they confront the growth of the administrative state, threats to their security, and potential erosion of well-entrenched civil rights.   This project seeks to understand the impact of the legal complex (configurations of lawyers, judges, legal academics) on advances towards or retreats from political liberalism over recent decades. It does so in several ways: by examining their salience to contemporary political transitions; by broadening the scope of countries to East Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America; by juxtaposing mature democracies with new democracies, transitional regimes, and illiberal regimes; and by drawing the dynamics of lawyers, judges, and legal academics into the same explanatory frame.  The research enterprise brings together approximately twenty specialists on law and politics for particular countries to produce case studies of the legal complex and liberalism. The project is a collective effort where participants will deliberate intensively in two conferences to compare and contrast cases and to develop jointly new concepts and theory that can embrace the diversity of cases.  The project will produce one or more books and some articles that are tightly integrated around the theoretical framework that is developed collectively, and is intended as a stepping-stone more extensive and systematic inquiry, including quantitative analysis, worldwide."

Why has there been such a rapid rise in criminal counter-violence, counter-violence that tends to be brutally disproportionate to the felonies it seeks to punish? Why, too, does it attract great popular support among people who refuse to participate in community policing programs under the aegis of the state? What does this retributive violence mean to the people who perpetrate it? Why do they do it, and what does it do for them? This project seeks to answer these broad questions. It also sets out to map and typify the various types of alternative law enforcement and popular justice that have emerged in South Africa; to establish how much legitimacy, public support, and active participation they actually enjoy among different sectors of the population; to account for both the substance and the form of these populist activities; to ascertain the extent to which they undermine state control over the means of violence; and to explain why efforts on the part of the government and the South African Police Services to create legitimate community policing structures have tended to fail badly, while informal community enforcement draws enthusiastic, broad-based participation. Finally, the project will place South Africa in comparative perspective, thus to determine whether the kinds, causes, and effects of alternative policing and popular justice here are the same as or different from those elsewhere.  <br/><br/>The study begins with an assertion and two working theses. The assertion is that while the mass resort to informal policing, in its various forms, is widely understood and portrayed as a pragmatic response to the realities of social disorder, it is also the product of an increasingly taken-for-granted ideological formation, one that hides itself in technical necessity. This suggests our first, very general working thesis: that the dramatic rise of alternative policing, retributive violence, and community justice in South Africa -- as well as their form and their content -- is a response to processes of executive devolution and moral deregulation that have accompanied the growth of neoliberal economic development and, in particular, its impact on the sovereign power of the state. The second thesis asserts that the more-or-less visible sociological dynamic at the core of alternative policing, retributive violence, and popular justice in South Africa is a generational antagonism, an antagonism fueled by conditions in which black male youth are caught up in a violent struggle with people of property.<br/><br/>Ethnographic and documentary research will be centered in two locales within South Africa: (a) the rural and semi-rural Northwest, Limpopo and Mpumalanga Provinces, where alternative policing is at its most variously developed and where a basis has been laid for the investigative work; and (b) the urban precincts of Cape Town, in which a wide range of popular forms of justice are in evidence. Archival research will be centered in Pretoria and Cape Town. The product of this research will be a series of essays and a book.<br/>"

Seamounts, submerged isolated mountains in the oceans, are amongst the most diverse and still most poorly understood marine biological environments. They are formed by a range of geological processes and may be found at any ocean latitude, depth and environment. Most seamounts are volcanoes that eventually may grow to become ocean islands or reefs. Seamounts travel with tectonic plates away from their site of origin, often by thousands of miles, and then subside as the plate cools with age. This makes seamounts the oldest intact mountains on Earth.  They remain in isolation for up to 150 million of years, each one of them an experiment in benthic life evolution within distinct geological boundary conditions. Seamounts offer access of benthic life to a range of mid-water conditions, from deep nutrient rich currents to shallow water.  Initial biological studies reveal that seamounts display extreme biodiversity.  This offers unique opportunities to identify and explore novel microorganisms, and to study their physiology, biochemistry and genomics in well constrained settings.<br/><br/>Seamount research involves many scientific disciplines (e.g. oceanography and volcanology) that only rarely communicate with each other, but biology has much to gain from interfacing with the whole spectrum. Overcoming these challenges of interdisciplinary integration are important to successful biological exploration of the interface between the hydrosphere, lithosphere and biosphere.  The goal of the SBN is to bring together all the diverse scientific disciplines involved in seamount research, to communicate about and discuss seamount science, and to ease or share the logistical burden of field expeditions. Key components of this network include regular workshops, and the development of a community website and a database that integrates a wide range of seamount data.<br/>"

It has received much less<br/>attention in oceanography probably because it is generally thought to occur only for  anticyclonically (clockwise) sheared parallel flows or anticyclones of strengths not typically observed in the ocean. However, there are many observations of anticyclonic currents in the ocean that are marginally stable, and this suggests that inertial instability may be the primary mechanism by which anticyclonic shear and anticyclonic vortices are maintained at stable or marginally stable values. <br/><br/>The criterion for inertial instability is often quoted as Rossby number  less than minus one, where a negative Rossby number implies anticyclonic flow  However this criterion applies only to flows in homogeneous fluids  like the mixed layer  with no vertical shear  In stratified flow that is vertically sheared  as is commonly the case  inertial instability can also occur with Rossby numbers between -1 and 0.  Furthermore,  even cyclonically sheared flows or cyclonic vortices for which Ro is greater than zero can be inertially unstable if the vertical shear is strong enough.  It is also interesting that this instability can occur when the Richardson number is well above a quarter that is, in flows that are stable to the Kelvin Helmholtz instability, a controlling factor in oceanic flows. In other words, flows that are stable with regard to the well known Richardson number criterion can, in fact, be unstable because of inertial instability. It is therefore possible that inertial instability is frequently a controlling factor in oceanic flows without having been recognized as such. This renewal proposal will continue studies of inertial instability with the object of providing a fundamental basis for understanding the role that inertial instability plays in the worlds oceans. Under prior NSF funding, the investigators have performed a systematic numerical study of the effect of varying basic parameters on the inertial instability of idealized model vortices with no vertical shear and with weak vertical shear. In addition, the resulting analytical model, based on plane parallel horizontally sheared flow, is able to explain and predict much of the fundamental results of the numerical studies. From these investigations, there are now guidelines for exploring further. The previous studies will be extended to much more realistic models of oceanic vortices. Through a series of numerical simulations the effects of inertial instability will be studied in a variety of model vortices over a wide range of the essential parameters.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: By undertaking our investigation of inertial instability, we hope to improve our understanding of the role that inertial instability plays in stabilization and maintenance of oceanic currents and eddies.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: As a broader impact, these studies should provide guidance for those attempting to develop parameterizations for ocean models and criteria for determining likely locations for intense internal wave generation and inertial instability. Because of the intrinsically small vertical scales of inertial instability, it is usually not resolved by ocean models. Thus, the simulated flows can become and stay inertially unstable. This unphysical behavior must be corrected to maintain currents in the models at physically realizable levels, but a proper parameterization of the effects of the instability can be obtained only through increased understanding. This collaborative research project will foster an international collaboration with professor Orlandi at the University of Rome and one of his graduate students.<br/><br/>"

All five universities are among the nation's leaders in awarding PhDs in the SBE fields to underrepresented minority students. The plan for the AC-SBE Alliance includes elements designed to help students at each step as they move from undergraduate school into graduate programs and onto the professoriate. The consortium has four objectives: (1) Recruit and prepare undergraduates to pursue a PhD in SBE fields, (2) Assist students in the transition from undergraduate to graduate study, (3) Retain PhD students and increase degree completion rates, and (4) Prepare future SBE faculty for success. Although each of the five schools in the AC-SBE alliance has unique features, the AC-SBE Alliance will include a number of overarching activities that will involve all five universities. For one example, the Alliance will build upon Howard University's Summer Institute that prepares future faculty in the STEM disciplines to launch a parallel SBE component. Also, entering AC-SBE students will be invited to participate in a one-week course Introduction to Data Analysis for the Social Sciences at the Odum Institute for Research in the Social Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Odum Institute will also offer a number of videoconference short courses for AC-SBE students.

A time series is simply a collection of data arriving in time order. They arise in fields ranging from physics to finance or medicine or music. Often the data comes from sensors, that are becoming deployed in rapidly increasing number of applications and whose data rates are continuing to increase sharply. Fast (online) response is desirable in many applications (e.g., remote aiming of a telescope to a fast-moving object of interest). The faster the volumes of the time series data grow, the more important it is to derive summary statistics about the data.

MAC also will be able to estimate solar absorption by clouds and to measure the dependence of that absorption on the amount of absorbing aerosols.  One of the fundamental challenges of observing how aerosols modulate cloud microphysics and cloud albedo is the need to observe the same cloud element simultaneously from below, above, and inside the cloud; i.e., to measure how much aerosol is being transported to the cloud from below and from above; to measure how the cloud drop number density as a function of drop radius is changing in response to the injection of aerosols; and, finally, to observe how the cloud albedo, in-cloud solar absorption, and the transmission of solar radiation through the cloud to the cloud base is responding to the change in cloud microphysical properties. The PIs will undertake such a research mission with three identical lightweight Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (AUAVs) outfitted with miniaturized instruments for measuring aerosols, cloud microphysics, and radiation. They will conduct a pilot demonstration mission from the Maldives Islands for a period of six weeks during the dry and polluted season through February and March, 2006.

The potential educational and training that would result from the fieldwork and analyses phases of MAC adds an important broader impacts component to the project.

A mechanism that augments mixing is apparently missing. One possible mechanism involves penetration of the thermocline by eddy motions from the mixed layer. Another is enhanced shear and/or overturns due to internal waves (which may themselves be generated either locally or elsewhere). In either case, it appears important to include the compliance of the thermocline in models of wind-driven mixing; i.e., to study the interaction of the actively forced Langmuir circulations with high-frequency internal waves.<br/><br/>In order to answer these questions, this project will analyze high resolution data collected as part of the Hawaiian Ocean Mixing Experiment (HOME). The instrumentation includes a multi-beam surface-sidescan Doppler sonar system that is designed to define the length and time scales of the mixed layer motion (e.g. Langmuir circulation), directional surface waves, and surface strain fields associated with high-frequency internal waves, a rapid-profiling CTDs that provides density profiles with resolution in both time and depth sufficient to estimate mixing via overturns (Thorpe scales). an 8-beam coded pulse Doppler sonar system that samples flows and shears over the water column (upward and downward from 400m). and wind speed and direction instruments. The central question addressed by this project is ""Do internal waves affect the mixed layer motions, and hence alter entrainment and mixing in the uppermost pycnocline?"" To test the hypothesis that they do, the investigators will look at effects of high-frequency internal waves on the form and dynamics of the surface velocity structures like those seen in the data. An integral component of this proposal is employing a post-doc drawn from the Langmuir circulation modeling community, incorporating internal wave physics of incrementally increasing complexity, and re-sampling the output to mimic the data. The focus is on in-depth data/model comparisons, rather than on model development per se: the strategy involves re-sampling and statistical comparisons. The anticipated results include improved understanding and models of oceanic surface layer mixing. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit. The project focuses on a link in the air/ocean system that is vitally important yet incompletely understood: net mixing through the surface layer of the sea. The mixed layer and uppermost pycnocline forms a crucial barrier between the atmosphere and deep ocean, controlling the net fluxes of heat, momentum, nutrients and greenhouse gases. This uppermost layer is also vital to marine life, setting the scene where light and nutrients meet, and where pollutants and contaminants are dispersed.<br/><br/>Broader impacts. The results will help improve air-sea exchange estimates, and hence climate effects, thereby helping improve the information by which policy decisions are made. The data sets, interpretations, and results will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific understanding and facilitate further re-examination and interpretation. Summaries accessible to the public and policy makers will be made available. The proposed activity will provide training and teaching opportunities for a post-doc.

Animated agents are anthropomorphic software objects in the user interface that, in their most advanced implementations, produce gestures, display facial expressions, and move their eyes in coordination with their speech.  They have been shown to improve user performance in some task domains (e.g. tutoring).  When might this technology help or hurt survey data quality and respondents' satisfaction?  How sophisticated must the agents be in order to provide benefit--or harm?  In a web survey, an agent might motivate respondents to participate and complete the task, much like human interviewers do, and help respondents understand the survey questions as intended while allowing respondents to participate at their convenience, as in ordinary web surveys.  On the other hand, the presence of an agent might discourage honest responding to questions about sensitive topics, much as human interviewers have been shown to do.  In this project a series of laboratory experiments examine more and less human-like agents that ask questions about respondents' sensitive and non-sensitive behaviors.  The studies contrast data quality and user satisfaction in non-agent web surveys to those with interface agents that vary in their dialogue capability, the degree to which they provide visual and spoken cues about their internal states, and the degree of intentionality in their speech.  The agents are simulated with software that converts a video image of a live interviewer into an animation in real time; respondents thus believe they are interacting with a computer-generated agent even though there is actually a human behind the ""agent.""  In the experiments about non-sensitive behaviors, respondents answer on the basis of fictional scenarios so that the accuracy of their answers can be determined.  One possible outcome is that agents with greater dialogue capability will promote interactions that lead to more accurate understanding and thus more accurate answers.  In the experiments about sensitive behaviors, respondents answer about their own lives; more reports of sensitive behaviors indicate greater respondent candor.  One possible outcome is that agents with more movement (lips, eyes, and eyebrows) will lead respondents to feel less private and therefore to answer less candidly than with agents whose movement is limited.  Respondents' satisfaction is measured with a post-interview questionnaire; the impact of different agent features on how respondents communicate with the survey system is measured by detailed turn-by-turn coding of all dialogue.<br/><br/>The practical impact of this work will be more informed decisions by survey researchers in adopting agent technology.  Knowing when agents help and what features help the most can focus decisions about what interfaces to develop and which ones not to develop.  For example, if dialogue capability is more important to data quality and user satisfaction than other agent features, this could focus future development efforts on conversational competence of agents more than on visual realism.  The theoretical impact of the proposed work will be in two areas.  First, it will deepen our understanding of how verbal and non-verbal communication are interconnected, for example how verbal interaction is affected by the fidelity of the agents' facial display.  Second, by comparing human-computer and human-human interaction the project will advance knowledge of how attributions of intentionality and human agency affect interaction more generally.  This research is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology. <br/>"

The project targets students pursuing careers in diverse fields such as environmental and health policy and law, genetics counseling, science journalism, and K-12 science education.  The adapted teaching methodologies, Integrated Lecture and Lab and ChemConnections, incorporate active-learning methods such as contextual learning, discussions, inquiry-based experiments, problem-solving, and group activities. It is a premise of the project that both methodologies are ideally suited for the student body, which needs to understand the chemistry in context, be engaged in activities that sustain their interest, and which include them in the learning process. While the targeted students are motivated to learn science, many do not have particularly strong science and math backgrounds or the inclination to enroll in traditional chemistry classes.  The curriculum being developed consists of four new courses:  Chemistry Around Us I and II  for the introductory level; and two intermediate level courses, Chemistry of Environment and Nanotechnology, which alternate every year.  The courses incorporate experiments and active-learning activities that make use of instrumentation and materials selected for that purpose.  The project is expected to accomplish several objectives: (1) to create a model multi-year chemistry curriculum for students pursuing careers that require strong scientific and quantitative understanding but are not traditional science or engineering disciplines; (2) evaluation of the success of the curriculum through use of a careful evaluation and assessment component; and (3) dissemination of the project's accomplishments to the broader community.  <br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The project adapts methodologies based on teaching methods supported by<br/>research as being successful in engaging students and involving them in the learning process, and enhancing conceptual and scientific thinking. This project involves a student body with diverse interests in science, and interested in career paths that are not traditional science and engineering careers. It is therefore expected that results of this project will contribute to the body of knowledge of how to effectively educate non-science majors in understanding fundamental science concepts towards appreciating the role of science in today's society.<br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>As reports and studies have pointed out, the education of all undergraduates would benefit from a level of scientific understanding of issues facing today's society. The curriculum being developed aims to achieve this, and a successful implementation of this project can serve as a model for a way of achieving this goal.  With a student body at Eugene Lang College comprising about 70% women and 11% underrepresented minorities, the project will involve a diverse group of undergraduates.<br/>"

Preliminary data from the Bishop Tuff have yielded high quality<br/>paleointensity results with a high success ratio (75%). In addition, the well documented presence<br/>of fine-grained cubic Fe-oxides spanning the superparamagnetic (SP) to single domain (SD) size<br/>range in silicic glasses from tuffs should be well suited for paleointensity determinations. These<br/>fine grained magnetic minerals in a glassy matrix may also be effectively armored during the<br/>multiple laboratory heatings necessary for a paleofield determination. Finally, ash flow tuffs are<br/>typically well suited for high precision 40Ar/39Ar dating that can provide an accurate age<br/>framework for any paleointensity results.<br/>This project is a pilot study of the Pleistocene Bishop Tuff aimed at evaluating the suitability of ash<br/>flow tuffs for absolute paleointensity studies. Because only portions of a particular ignimbrite will <br/>ultimately prove suitable for paleointensity work, a goal of the study will be to develop a strategy <br/>to identify the most likely materials for reliable paleointensities.<br/>The variability in magnetic mineralogy and cooling history in ash flows will also allow the testing of<br/>several additional aspects of paleointensity determinations, including the effects of cooling rate,<br/>magnetic mineralogy and the influence of chemical remanence on paleointensity results. These<br/>are important controls on paleointensity in all recording media and so these tests will yield<br/>valuable information for interpreting other paleointensity results.<br/>The main goal of this proposal is to evaluate whether reliable paleointensities<br/>can be determined from ignimbrites. If absolute paleointensities can be determined from ash flows, it may<br/>be possible to compile a much more comprehensive database of past field intensity fluctuations<br/>of the geomagnetic field. All data generated during the present project will be archived in the<br/>paleomagnetic data base (http://www.earthref.org/MAGIC/index.html) and the results will be<br/>presented at international conferences and in published papers.<br/>"

While few instances of adversarial exploits along these lines have been identified recently---namely, the PIs work on Reduction of Quality (RoQ) attacks on admission controllers of end-hosts and on TCP adaptation in networks---little is known about the significance, prevalence, and other-than-adversarial motives of such exploits, not to mention effective defenses. <br/><br/>INTELLECTUAL MERITS: The work to be pursued as part of this proposal flows along three dimensions: (1) vulnerability assessment, (2) attack synthesis, and (3) hardening and countermeasures. Along the first dimension, and in order to assess the vulnerability of system components, the PIs intend to adopt a control-theoretic approach to model the   transient operation of common adaptive system and network components -- from schedulers, load balancers, and admission controllers to network traffic engineering and routing protocols. These models will be used to analytically characterize the vulnerabilities of such components to various exploits, whether the motive of such exploits is adversarial in nature (e.g., reducing a system's fidelity or effective capacity) or simply unfriendly (e.g., causing the system to preferentially treat a particular class of requests or flows). Along the second dimension, the PIs will investigate how a determined adversary could infer the vulnerabilities of a given system component through simple observations (from the outside), and thereupon design an exploit of low intensity but of high impact on the component's availability or service quality. Along the third dimension, the PIs intend to develop mechanisms that harden a component's susceptibility to exploits by non-clairvoyant adversaries, and also enable the identification (e.g., trace-back) of perpetrators.<br/><br/>The PIs will focus their attention on two specific types of systems that are particularly vulnerable to exploits of adaptation dynamics, and with which they have had quite a bit of experience, namely (A) network management and engineering, and (B) scalable web services, virtual hosting environments, and firewalls. These systems are particularly vulnerable due to their open nature, necessitating the use of dynamic resource management policies, which are exploitable by adversaries.<br/><br/>Expected outcomes from this effort include:<br/>- The development of metrics and techniques that are capable of quantifying the vulnerabilities of computing systems to exploits that target their dynamics.  <br/>- The development of design principles that elucidate the tradeoffs between various design goals. For example, by relating a system's adaptation speed to its susceptibility to exploits, a system designer would be able to discern the risks and rewards involved in choosing one adaptation strategy versus another. <br/><br/>- The development of novel adaptation strategies and protocols that would be tolerant to specific exploits. While the PIs' focus will be on adaptation techniques that are prevalent in Internet systems, the new approaches and principles they develop will be applicable to a much wider range of systems, including operating systems, embedded systems, sensor networks, ad-hoc and distributed systems, among others.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACT: The proposed work will also result in important tangible contributions to education and training through the development of various artifacts, including:<br/>- The creation of a repository that would act as a knowledge base of known vulnerabilities and defenses in various adaptive systems. The mere availability of such a repository would be quite instrumental in hardening newly developed systems by enabling practitioners access to what amounts to benchmarks for testing their designs.<br/>- The development of artifacts (e.g., tutorials, laboratory modules, software tools, and Web-based demonstrations) that could be integrated into standard systems and networking curricula. <br/><br/>In addition, the pursuit of the proposed work will result in important intangible broader impacts, including:<br/>- Heightening the research community's appreciation of the importance of system dynamics, which will undoubtedly lead to concrete advancement in basic research with the expected outcomes of scientific publications and student training.<br/>- Leveraging the efforts of the PIs in extending their proven service record to the systems and networking research community, as well as their outreach to minority and under-represented groups.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the pursuit of the research outlined in this proposal will promote the design of information systems, which are worthy of (and to which we can entrust) our society.<br/><br/>"

The partnership will build on the success of URI's distinctive undergraduate International Engineering Program (IEP) and the Dual Degree Master's Program to create a new International Ph.D. This international education and research partnership will work collaboratively to: 1) develop sustainable, multidisciplinary international research opportunities from the undergraduate through Ph.D. level, 2) capitalize on complementary research strengths to create innovative discoveries, 3) create international internship opportunities for graduate students, and 4) provide graduate students with a rich international research experience to increase their ability to compete in the global marketplace.<br/>  The proposed research will be directed towards developing microfluidic technology for two diverse applications. The first is to develop a prototype lab-on-a chip for detecting disease biomarkers. The technology could play an integral role in responding to bioterrorism by providing a tool for early detection of infection prior to developing disease symptoms. The second application will lead to a better understanding of the triggering of landslide tsunamis.

This species-rich group of small green plants is remarkably diverse in structure, and includes extremely ancient relictual lineages as well as more recent radiations of closely related species. The antiquity of liverworts and the rich biodiversity at all taxonomic levels provide an unparalleled window into early land plant diversification. This collaborative effort brings together experts from around the world for a multidisciplinary, highly integrated approach that combines anatomical and developmental features with DNA sequence and genome structural characters to resolve phylogenetic relationships across the entire spectrum of liverwort diversity. Three general types of data will be compiled: 1) conservative morphological and genome characters to resolve deep ""backbone"" relationships, 2) anatomical/developmental data to resolve intermediate-depth lineages, and 3) morphological and DNA sequence characters to resolve relationships among a sample of 800 taxa representing all genera of liverworts.  A second major goal of the project is to integrate phylogenetic inferences and bionformatic efforts between this and other on-going NSF-supported projects, including several funded ATOL programs. These integrative activities include contributions to studies of genome structure and evolution across land plants, expansions of novel informatic tools to make methods, results, and implications widely accessible, and continued development of DNA sequence utilities that will benefit a broad range of scientists working on diverse organisms.<br/>        This project relies on the cooperation with and integration among research programs focused on resolving the green plant Tree Of Life.

Three general types of data will be compiled: 1) conservative morphological and genome characters to resolve deep ""backbone"" relationships, 2) anatomical/developmental data to resolve intermediate-depth lineages, and 3) morphological and DNA sequence characters to resolve relationships among a sample of 800 taxa representing all genera of liverworts.  A second major goal of the project is to integrate phylogenetic inferences and bionformatic efforts between this and other on-going NSF-supported projects, including several funded ATOL programs. These integrative activities include contributions to studies of genome structure and evolution across land plants, expansions of novel informatic tools to make methods, results, and implications widely accessible, and continued development of DNA sequence utilities that will benefit a broad range of scientists working on diverse organisms.<br/>        This project relies on the cooperation with and integration among research programs focused on resolving the green plant Tree Of Life. Integrative activities are substantive and consequential, and include expansions to phylogenetic databases and methodological/conceptual aspects of work toward resolving the Tree Of Life.  At least six post-doctoral associates and as many graduate students will be supported by the project, with substantial involvement of undergraduates as well. An effort to involve and retain individuals from underrepresented groups will be orchestrated through established federal programs that focus on such initiatives, including the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and the McNair Scholars Program. A solid mentoring infrastructure will be developed within each research team to provide support and professional experiences that ensure productivity and success of all participants. Outreach efforts include web presentations on the morphology and identification of liverworts for educators at all levels, development of web-based materials and a workshop targeting secondary school teachers, and increasing public awareness through weekend field excursions.<br/><br/>"

Damping can be achieved through various mechanical means, and for each of these, one seeks ways to distribute material properties to optimally stifle vibrations.  Yet optimality can be characterized in several ways, such as the total energy caused by a worst-case vibration, total energy averaged over all vibrations, and the asymptotic rate of energy decay.  Each of these different metrics requires different mathematical tools and computational techniques.  To address these problems, this project will draw upon, and augment, tools from mechanics, functional analysis, and numerical analysis.  The task of finding the best damping is a spectral optimization problem, which is particularly challenging because the mathematical models for these vibrating bodies are non-self-adjoint and have variable coefficients.  As such, they are representative of a broad class of important problems in application areas such as fluid dynamics, and thus insights gained from this work may suggest advances on a broad class of problems.  In addition to design optimization, this project will also develop techniques for characterizing the material properties of a body based on measurements of vibration.  Of particular interest are models comprising several one-dimensional entities vibrating together.  At the macroscopic level, such models describe violin strings composed of an elastic core enclosed in a dissipative sheath below an outer elastic winding, while at the microscopic level, similar models have been proposed to model DNA as two intertwined rods glued together elastically."

Craig Venter Institute has so far collected samples from over 70 oceanic sites between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Australia as part of the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS).  A""metagenome"" analysis of the plankton community will be performed on samples from the seven northernmost sites, constituting surface waters of the Western North Atlantic Ocean near Halifax, Nova Scotia for this NSF-funded project.  A metagenome is the combined genetic information of an entire microbial community.  The significance of a metagenomic analysis is that most bacteria cannot be cultured, thus we currently know very little about the identities and properties of natural microbial populations.  In contrast with some other regions of the ocean, nutrient gradients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) in the Western North Atlantic are typically moderate except during periods of deep vertical mixing.  Marine microbial community biodiversity will be quantitatively characterized using high throughput DNA sequencing and whole genome shotgun assembly techniques.   Through this ""whole environment"" shotgun genomics approach, microorganisms will be inventoried to determine overall species diversity, discover and characterize new prokaryotic species and genes, and evaluate the ecological roles that microbes play in the Western North Atlantic biome.  Results will be compared to those from previous metagenomic work at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series (BATS) site as well as to other sites along the GOS.  Very preliminary analysis of sequences from each of the seven Western North Atlantic sites has indicated that they are distinct from all other samples collected thus far on the GOS expedition.  This underscores the importance of obtaining far deeper sequence data since genes and organisms detected in these samples do not seem to be similar to those at other locations on the GOS.  <br/><br/>Genomics is a rapidly developing field that is creating changes in medicine, business, and agriculture on a scale analogous to the industrial revolution, but it's impact in environmental microbiology will likely be even greater than in these other areas. By having deeper DNA sequence coverage of the Western North Atlantic samples, a comparative genomic analysis of uncultured organisms will be undertaken at an unprecedented level of interrogation.  All results of the genomic analysis will be made rapidly and readily available to the global scientific community. Students and teachers who have an understanding of genomics can appreciate the impact it is making on society and make informed decisions about the issues it raises.  Therefore, a critical step in this project is to include training and outreach for K - 12 students, through mobile laboratories, as well as to graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and established faculty members through a two-day workshop on the analysis and availability of the Western North Atlantic metagenomic data. <br/>"

Thus, little information is available regarding the impact of such natural disasters on buried infrastructure systems.  In the aftermath of the 1997 Red River flood, which resulted in the flooding of Grand Forks and portions of the city of Winnipeg, Canada, it was suggested that the effect of surcharge on the internal pressure loading in vitrified clay gravity pipes resulted in extensive cracking.  When the water receded, loss of bedding support also was suspected to occur.  However, when attempts to collect data were undertaken more than a year after the water receded, the actual impacts of the flood on the deterioration of the sewer collection system were difficult to clearly identify. Hurricane Katrina brought the most severe flooding in modern US history, including the submergence of the City of New Orleans, a one million strong major metropolitan area. At present, there are no proven tools for assessing the damage sustained by buried infrastructure networks in the 90,000 sq. mile hurricane-struck area.<br/><br/>This award will focus on collecting time-sensitive data in areas where the water has receded such as Slidell, Louisiana and Biloxi, Mississippi.  Data to be collected includes visual inspection of the current condition of underground piping systems using closed-circuit television (CCTV), damage to surrounding above ground structures and infrastructure, maximum height and velocity of the wave front, the depth and the length of time the water flooded the impacted area, and the condition of vertical buried structures such as manholes.  Other data to be collected include the type, diameter, material and age of the pipeline networks that will be inspected and information regarding recent rehabilitation activities such as pipe lining.  The award seeks to identify damage mechanisms due to non-traditional loading associated with hurricane flood waves and long term flooding.  Studied areas will be carefully chosen to include areas recently CCTVed (or subjected to other condition assessment survey methods) to allow the condition before and after the hurricane to be quantified.  While physical inspection will be limited to sanitary and storm sewer collection systems, data will be also collected on the water and natural gas distribution systems in the studied areas.<br/><br/>The time-sensitive data collected in this study and the knowledge gained regarding the failure mechanisms associated with hurricane-related loading will serve as a basis for enhancement of current design and construction practices.  Quantitative data on the damage suffered by selected underground systems will allow for better assessment of the damage to the wider hurricane-struck area.  Thus, the information gathered and the knowledge gained under this study will contribute to the reconstruction efforts of buried infrastructure systems in the Gulf Coast area and to the prevention of flood-related failures in the future.<br/><br/>"

To date, attempts to develop custom hardware devices for wireless neural sensing have led to systems with varied advantages and drawbacks as the result of trade-offs between power consumption, noise and cost. The use of commercial off the shelf technology requires a much smaller and faster development effort than required for custom efforts, while simultaneously providing state-of-the-art data-processing, networking, and communication technology. But such systems are typically bulky and power intensive. This effort supported by this award represents a compromise between the use of custom designed sub-systems and the use of off-the-shelf components. The PI expects to achieve a balance between low-noise and low-power signal transmission, data communication, and networking performance, while providing unprecedented local digital signal processing and bi-directional communications capabilities. Specifically, the objective is the development of a wireless neural sensing, stimulation, and communication platform capable of 1) transmitting multiple channels of neural signals from, and 2) applying pre-defined or feedback stimuli to any number of freely behaving and interacting rodents in their natural environment. Efforts will be focused on 1) completing a comprehensive web-based two-channel wireless EEG recording system, 2) enabling programmed event-based remote stimulation, and 3) implementing ultra low-power multi-channel single-unit recording capabilities for chronic experiments. The proposed wireless neural recording and stimulation system will serve as a foundation for novel, comprehensive, and minimally invasive devices permitting study of brain function in an unprecedented manner. The approach used in this research proposal could potentially serve as a model for future research endeavors in that it initially leverages a new and revolutionary technology for near-term goals, and proceeds to enhance this underlying technology to meet longer-term goals. Students at all postsecondary levels will be involved in the project, through both hands-on research training and participation in a class dealing with micro electro-mechanical systems."

0455926	Collaborative Research: The Impact of Legitimacy by Endorsement on Coalition Formation in Power Structures	SES	SOCIOLOGY	09/01/2005	09/01/2005	Henry Walker	AZ	University of Arizona	Standard Grant	Patricia White	02/29/2008	"$19,776.00"		hawalker@u.arizona.edu	888 N Euclid Ave	Tucson	AZ	857194824	5206266000	SBE	1331	"0000, OTHR"	$0.00	"SES-0456064<br/>David Willer<br/>University of South Carolina<br/><br/>SES-0455926<br/>Henry Walker<br/>University of Arizona<br/><br/>This research integrates two major sociological theoretical research perspectives-Network Exchange Theory and Legitimacy Theory-to study the effects of legitimacy by endorsement on coalition formation in strong power structures. From Network Exchange Theory (NET), experiments have been completed to show that high-power central actors reap maximal benefits at exchange and low-power peripherals get minimal rewards. At issue for this research is whether low power actors will act to form coalitions and oppose the power exercised over them and, if so, with what effectiveness. Legitimacy Theory (LT) argues that group members are more likely to take actions that are collectively legitimized. When applied to exchange network processes, LT implies that low power actors are more likely to initiate coalition activity, to actually form coalitions, and to act effectively in them when coalition formation has been legitimized. The current experiments will study the effects of legitimacy by endorsement. In LT, endorsement refers to the approval or support that low power actors give to various elements of social situations including actors, positions or roles, behaviors and the rules that link actors, roles and behaviors. In this experimental study, subjects will complete a series of negotiations and exchanges in two-part. In Part 1, subjects negotiate exchanges independently. No one is given the opportunity to form a coalition. Joint application of NET and LT implies that subjects are most likely to initiate coalition formation and to actually form coalitions in the High Endorsement treatment and least likely to do so in the Low Endorsement condition with the control condition falling between. Coalitions are expected to be more stable (i.e., members are less likely to defect) and more effective in the High Endorsement condition and least stable and least effective in the Low Endorsement condition. A coalition's effectiveness is measured by the extent of its success in countervailing power. The two-structure design permits observation of size effects on coalition formation, stability and effectiveness, and permits tests of more than 20 additional theoretical predictions.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACT<br/>The theory of collective action offers a quite gloomy picture for the prospects of acting collectively. Nevertheless, collective actions do succeed and, when they do, often that theory is silent. Do they succeed at times because of the effects of legitimacy? This research will answer that question. The research will enhance sociology's infrastructure by adding its coalition designs to the Web-Lab housed at the University of South Carolina (weblab.moore.sc.edu). Like all Web-Lab designs, researchers at any location in the U.S. or elsewhere will be able to access these. The USC laboratory contributes to research-based learning, offering undergraduate and graduate classes using the Web-Lab. Designs used in this research will importantly enhance that course work. The USC laboratory also enhances diversity among student researchers. Currently, the majority of student researchers are women and, in a typical year, 20% of student researchers are African-American."

The project will provide significant research training experience for students, especially undergraduates.  The multi-institutional team includes researchers in the Biology Departments at the University of Puerto Rico-Humacao and UPR-Mayaguez, and the University of Connecticut. They will undertake a multidisciplinary research effort to study the geological contributions of microorganisms in the Cabo Rojo salterns.  Two different microbial mat systems in the salterns will be used to compare how microbial metabolism alters the geochemical characteristics of sediments and ultimately defines the microscale mineralogy.  The production of biogenic gases by these different microbial communities will also be studied.  As the salterns are characterized by extreme seasonal changes, their metabolic and community composition is continuously altered leading to differential patterns of gene and protein expression.  Knowledge of the molecular aspects that control the precipitation and dissolution of key minerals such as calcium carbonate has important implications with respect to sediment formation, construction of oceanic reefs and deterioration of stone monuments.  By the identification of genes and proteins crucial for the regulation of these processes, it may be possible to control and possibly even manipulate them at the molecular level.  Besides the scientific contributions, the most valuable products of this project are a generation of Puerto Rican students trained with state-of-the-art techniques.  Students will benefit with a series of workshops and conferences, a summer exchange program with students at the University of Connecticut, and a pioneer program providing information about the field of geomicrobiology to K-12 students.  Students will also construct a weather station that will be publicly accessible to monitor the conditions atthe observatory via the internet."

Molted seal skin and hair occur along 300 km of coastline, more than 1000 km from any extant colony. The last record of a seal at a former colony site is at ~A.D. 1600. Because abandonment occurred prior to subantarctic sealing, disappearance of the VLC colony probably was due to environmental factors, possibly cooling and encroachment of land-fast, perennial sea ice that made access to haul-out sites difficult. The record of seal inhabitation along the VLC, therefore, has potential as a proxy for climate change. Elephant seals are a predominantly subantarctic species with circumpolar distribution. Genetic studies have revealed significant differentiation among populations, particularly with regard to that at Macquarie I., which is the extant population nearest to the abandoned VLC colony. Not only is the Macquarie population unique genetically, but it is has undergone unexplained decline of 2%/yr over the last 50 years3. In a pilot study, genetic analyses showed a close relationship between the VLC seals and those at Macquarie I. An understanding of the relationship between the two populations, as well as of the environmental pressures that led to the demise of the VLC colonies, will provide a better understanding of present-day population genetic structure, the effect of environmental change on seal populations, and possibly the reasons underlying the modern decline at Macquarie Island.<br/>This project addresses several key research problems: (1) Why did elephant seals colonize and then abandon the VLC? (2) What does the elephant seal record reveal about Holocene climate change and sea-ice conditions? (3) What were the foraging strategies of the seals and did these strategies change over time as climate varied? (4) How does the genetic structure of the VLC seals relate to extant populations? (5) How did genetic diversity change over time and with colony decline? (6) Using ancient samples to estimate mtDNA mutation rates, what can be learned about VLC population dynamics over time? (7) What was the ecological relationship between elephant seals and Adelie penguins that occupied the same sites, but apparently at different times? The proposed work includes the professional training of young researchers and incorporation of data into graduate and undergraduate courses."

(CUAHSI). CUAHSI has prepared a science agenda that identifies the interfaces among traditional boundaries among the atmosphere, land surface, groundwater and surface-water subdisciplines as the most promising areas for research. Substantive progress will only be achieved with multidisciplinary approaches applied at larger spatial scales to obtain coherent data sets than have typically been done in the past. CUAHSI envisages four mutually supportive infrastructure elements to meet this goal: 1) a network of hydrologic observatories, 2) an information system, 3) a measurement technologies program, and 4) a hydrologic synthesis facility. This project requests funds to provide a core support for the development and management of these facilities as well as to initiate the observatories and synthesis facility.<br/>Because this scale of coordinated research has not been previously attempted by the hydrologic science community, we propose to begin with a 'paper prototype' of a single river basin (a hydrologic observatory) designed to address a small set of specific hypotheses carefully chosen to yield a data set that will provide a robust characterization of the basin. Thus a data set sufficient to answer important questions and broad enough to be useful for many studies will emerge. The prototype will identify both the scientific and economic synergies from coordinating research in a single river basin. The Neuse River has been chosen as the site for this prototype.<br/>The second proposed activity is to initiate a hydrologic synthesis facility, envisioned as a place where hydrologic scientists from various disciplines can come together conveniently and at low marginal cost to tackle central problems in the field. A workshop to design the facility and funding for an initial synthesis project, including a competition for its selection, are proposed.<br/>This project will permit hydrologic science to make fundamental advances by providing facilities with capabilities currently unavailable to the community. These activities have been chosen to provide the greatest return on investment to move hydrologic science to a new plane of understanding. The benefits to society of improved hydrologic understanding are manifold, including more reliable forecasting of conditions and wiser management of water resources."

This project will synthesize and test other nitrosipine derivatives and determine the efficacy of Ga67 uptake in animal models using these complexing agents.<br/><br/>The commercial application of this technology is in the area of diagnostic imaging. The use of Ga67 in tumor imaging is currently very limited due to poor selectivity of the agent for tumor cells.

Twin studies are the most common type of study used to tease apart the impact of environmental and genetic factors on language development. Because identical twins share 100% of their alleles and fraternal twins share only 50% of their alleles, if identical twin pairs' linguistic abilities are more similar than fraternal twin pairs', this suggests that genetic factors play a role in language. Furthermore, the rate of language impairments and delays is twice as high for twins as singletons, probably reflecting pre- and postnatal environmental hazards associated with twinning. Thus, twin studies can be used to investigate how specific environmental factors affect language development. <br/><br/>This project will use longitudinal data from 450 twin pairs to investigate how genetic and prenatal and postnatal environmental factors affect linguistic and nonlinguistic development. The project will address the following key questions:<br/>1. How great a role do genetic factors play in the linguistic and nonlinguistic development of linguistically normal and language-impaired children?<br/>2. How specific to language (or subcomponents of language) are these genetic factors?<br/>3. To what extent do prenatal and early postnatal environmental factors affect linguistic and nonlinguistic development?<br/>4.

How do interactions among environmental and genetic factors affect normal and language-impaired children's linguistic and non-linguistic development?<br/>The direct and indirect costs of language-related learning disabilities are enormous to the impaired child, their family and society. This study may help uncover which environmental factors protect children from impairments and which increase their risk. This study may also provide needed insight into the ways in which genetic factors and environmental factors interact to raise or lower the risk of linguistic and nonlinguistic impairment.

Traxler will conduct three years of linguistic research examining how readers access and use stored grammatical knowledge while comprehending sentences. The project will use a highly accurate eye-tracker to monitor readers' eye movements as they process sentences of various grammatical types. The experiments will assess the degree to which processing of one sentence facilitates the processing of a following sentence with a similar syntactic structure or overlapping lexical (word-related) information. Because eye-movements are highly sensitive to small changes in processing demands, the readers' patterns of eye-movements will indicate whether reading one sentence speeds the processing of a subsequent sentence. The goals of this research are to (a) determine whether building a ""context-free"" syntactic structure for one sentence can speed processing of a following sentence, (b) determine whether argument-structure information that is tied to specific words that appear in two consecutive sentences provides the only means to speed processing of the second sentence, and (c) to determine whether facilitated processing occurs across a range of sentence types or is limited to only those sentences that normally cause substantial processing difficulty. <br/>The results of this research will be important for understanding how grammatical knowledge is stored and used to determine how words in sentences are related to one another. Further, the results will inform ongoing discussion of the extent to which readers discover the syntactic structure of a sentence by using an autonomous parsing module versus accessing and applying a wide range of probabilistic cues, including lexically stored frequencies. A fully articulated model of normative language processing, particularly those processes used to parse sentences, may be useful to practitioners working with aphasic populations and computer scientists developing computer-based language understanding systems."

This is one of the first order problems identified by the ""Geochemical Earth Reference Model"" (GERM) initiative, and by the ""subduction factory"" focus of the NSF ""MARGINS"" initiative. One way to study this problem is to examine outcrops of lithospheric mantle that underlie crust known to have formed by magmatism above a subduction zone. This mantle represents, in part, the source from which the overlying crust was extracted, and its mineralogy and composition reflect the processes that have affected it through time, including melt extraction, fluid phase enrichment, and subsequent interactions with melt derived from lower in the mantle. The primary advantage of this approach is that large tracts of supra-subduction lithosphere are commonly exposed at the base of many ophiolites, allowing us to examine their composition directly and on larger length scales than is currently possible in any active system. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the geochemical flux preserved in lithospheric mantle above the proto-Franciscan subduction zone, as represented by harzburgite and dunite tectonites that underlie the Coast Range ophiolite of California. The goal is constrain the nature and extent of these fluxes, as documented by whole rock major element and trace element analyses, by mineral analyses using electron and ion beam techniques, and by isotopic analyses of ultra-pure, hand-picked mineral separates. Major questions we will pose include the cumulative extent of melt extraction and the nature of the melt extracted, the nature, source, and extent of fluid flux to the mantle in the SSZ wedge, and the nature and extent of mantle-melt interactions subsequent to melt extraction (e.g., addition of melt from sub-lithospheric sources, or reaction of this melt with the previously depleted peridotites). <br/><br/>The geochemical evolution of the source region for island arc volcanics is an important problem with implications not only for the chemical budget of the Earth, but also for the origin of ore deposits that are commonly associated with island arc volcanism, the transfer of volatile elements from inside the Earth into the atmosphere, and the time scales over which these processes occur. While volcanoes are found on many terrestrial planets, plate tectonics and arc volcanism are unique to Earth and represent an important component of planetary evolution."

This next-generation matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) ion trap mass spectrometer will be designed to overcome the high m/z (mass/charge) barrier. The project incorporates a cross-disciplinary collaborative effort by chemists, physicists and biologists both in academia and industry and should greatly impact the mass analysis of mega-Dalton biomolecules.<br/><br/>The proposed heavy-ion mass spectrometer will have ultra-high sensitivity by interfacing three innovative MS components: i.) a unique MALDI source, ii.) a mega-Dalton mass range ion trap and iii.) a detector with 100% detection efficiency at high mass. The goal is to analyze large molecules or complexes with m/z ranging from 10,000 to 15,000,000 at the attomole level. The development of this new instrument should provide breakthrough performance for the direct mass analysis of mega-Dalton biomolecules, bio-structures, non-covalent and covalent multi-protein complexes, protein/adducts, DNA and viruses. This project is directed at a long-term research goal of single cell proteomics. <br/><br/>The development and dissemination of a next-generation mass spectrometer for analysis of macromolecules will impact many fields. For the biological sciences, the proposed instrument should significantly advance research in proteomics, where the challenge is to identify all proteins and characterize all protein-protein interactions in a biological system. In addition, the instrument's capabilities should benefit the field of nanotechnology, which currently lacks a good method to characterize large molecules. To educate students and scientists about the heavy-ion mass spectrometer, presentations about this development will target both small colleges and major universities. The mega-Dalton mass spectrometer will be used to teach undergraduates, graduate students and post doctorial students about MS instrumentation development both in these presentations and in courses taught at Carnegie Mellon (Chem 09-543: Mass Spectrometry and Chem 09-445: Undergraduate Research). Undergraduate research positions will be offered to students from under-represented groups.

The Institute has an evolving Science Agenda identifying particular areas for research that have been defined by the scientific community of the Americas. The Science Agenda is complementary to the research priorities of the US Climate Change Science Program. <br/><br/>This grant will support the second round of the IAI Collaborative Research Program (CRN II). The program supports 10-12 regional research networks addressing global change issues of regional relevance that advance the understanding of global change phenomena and their socio-economic impacts. All projects are highly interdisciplinary. Each network involves Principal Investigators and Co-Investigators from institutions in at least four IAI member countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Ecuador, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, USA and Venezuela). The networks were selected on the basis of submitted proposals evaluated for technical merit using a peer-review system. Results from this research will be available to the US scientific community, as a condition of US funding, through an electronic data and information system. The IAI receives additional support for its activities from the other Parties. This additional support takes the form of direct contributions to the IAI Budget, in-kind contributions, or in-kind contribution pledges made at the time of proposal submission in the form of investigator salaries, ship-time, computer time, logistical support, etc.<br/><br/>The program is integrative, involving the natural and the social sciences in a collaborative way and seeking to provide sound scientific understanding of global change issues in support of sustainable development in the region. CRN II promotes applied science with a focus on emerging issues and themes that have not been dealt with under previous IAI programs or that are not yet (fully) explored. The CRN program brings together multinational and multidisciplinary teams of researchers to carry out regional-level research projects that no one country or institution could carry out individually. The collective research capacity of the participating institutions is huge, making possible an entirely new structure for participation in multinational and multidisciplinary projects focused on global change.<br/><br/>The outcomes of the individual projects contribute to the development and strengthening of regional capacity to deal with global change. The program provides a scientific basis for documenting, understanding and projecting changes in the Earth system, and specifically to facilitate the full use of scientific information in policy and decision making. CRN II includes a strong capacity building component in terms of graduate and post-graduate education and enhancement of institutional infrastructure, and also promotes the participation of scientists from countries with less developed global change research communities. The first round of CRN showed that the multinational component of the projects provides an excellent opportunity for dialogue and exchanges among top researchers, students, decision makers and institutions from across the Americas, which in many cases led to partnerships that lasted and evolved far beyond the end of the individual CRN I projects. CRN II also promotes partnerships with other regional and/or international projects and programs, for example those of the Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP). Under the first round of CRN, those linkages were very effective not only in terms of coordination of associated efforts, but also as a medium to distribute the results of CRN science to a very broad audience. The synthesis of CRN II will be done through a technical synthesis for the scientific community and a non-technical synthesis for policy and decisions makers. This second synthesis is part of the IAI's strategy of communicating scientific information, models, and conclusions to and among researchers, educators, students, resource and industrial managers, policy makers and the public."

Perhaps most unusual are symbiotic partnerships that have allowed organisms to exploit ephemeral, recalcitrant, and sometimes toxic aquatic environments. Exploitation of energy in these environments often requires metabolic and physiological capabilities that cannot be accomplished by animals alone. One such symbiosis includes a unique partnership between a newly discovered group of polychaete worm Osedax (Latin = bone-devouring) and a microbe related to aerobic, hydrocarbon-degrading members of the group Oceanospirillales. This unusual association is the only known symbiosis capable of using the decaying bones of sunken marine mammals as a sole source of nutrition. The symbiotic microbe provides a nutritional bridge between high-energy compounds and the worm host, yet very little is known about the specific mechanisms that enable this novel ecological strategy. The goal of this project is to understand the specific nutritional integration between Osedax worms and their endosymbionts, including the metabolic capabilities of the novel symbiont and the pathways for converting carbon substrates into energy. This will be investigated using culture techniques to isolate the symbionts, along with molecular and biochemical methods, including functional gene amplification and measures of enzyme activity in both partners. These worms and their microbial symbionts likely play substantial roles in the cycling of organic compounds in marine communities. Remineralization of organic carbon, facilitated almost entirely by Osedax and its symbiont, is approximately 2000 years faster than the typical avenue of carbon delivery to the deep seafloor, a habitat representing approximately 50% of the Earth's surface. This project includes the goal of expanding interest in bacterial/animal interactions to the general public. Symbiosis, or the living together of different organisms, has dramatically affected life on Earth.

Funds are provided only to facilitate the coordination outlined below, maintain shared scientific equipment, and operate the machine shop to meet the needs of the science projects and the station. No funds are provided for activities that are covered by the individual investigator grants. The SCOARA, comprised of principal investigators involved in cosmology and astrophysics projects at the station, will enable the scientists to work together for: (a) providing community organization, coordination, and expert sharing of scientific support for approved South Pole Dark Sector science projects, (b) outfitting and staffing the shared Dark Sector machine shop, (c) keeping the shared scientific equipment at the Pole in good working order, (d) providing expert science winterover support shared among the projects, (e) conducting weekly teleconferences for Principal Investigators or their designees to address on-going and emerging issues related to the science projects at the Pole, and (f) educating, organizing, and coordinating the community in response to discussions about the limited support resources at the South Pole. With respect to the broader impacts, the proposed Science Coordination Office will focus on fostering, amongst the community, the goal of maintaining worldwide leadership, at the cutting edge of modern science, of the U.S. Antarctic astronomy and astrophysics programs. SCOARA will have an impact on understanding how the worldwide astronomical community might expand observations to sites in Antarctica where observing conditions might be even better than at South Pole. In addition, SCOARA would make it easier for new astrophysics projects (e.g., projects that receive new funding from NSF) to begin their operations at South Pole. This will be especially useful for smaller projects that are often associated with younger investigators. Finally, SCOARA also has obvious advantages for addressing education and public outreach issues, being better suited to organize outreach around a common theme relative to the efforts that individual projects could make separately."

The approach consists of developing a language (or languages) that is (are) sufficiently expressive to capture interesting classes of constraints, structure and mappings, and techniques for reasoning about how constraints are translated through these mappings. Using these techniques, algorithms for reasoning about the correctness of mappings with respect to constraints will be developed. Since an XML view also represents a mapping between two different XML sources, one of which is virtual, the related question of how to map an update on an XML view to the underlying data source will also be considered.<br/><br/>The results of this work will provide the ability to detect whether or not semantic conflicts will arise before data exchange actually occurs, thus avoiding time-consuming and unanticipated errors as data loading is performed at the target site. The project is motivated by problems in bioinformatics applications involving gene expression data sharing between projects in the Penn Center Bioinformatics. Since data exchange occurs in many different application domains, for example e-commerce, science, and government, the impact will be broadly applicable to all these areas.<br/><br/>The research performed will be included in an advanced database course taught by the PI, and undergraduate students will be involved in the research through a senior projects course.

Lutz	08/31/2009	"$147,279.00"		wo@northwestern.edu	1801 Maple Ave.	Evanston	IL	602013149	8474913003	SBE	1320	"0000, OTHR"	$0.00	"This award funds two projects in microeconomic theory. <br/><br/>Project 1: (Infinitely) repeated games have widespread application in economics as simple and tractable models of ongoing strategic relationships between agents. Despite an extensive literature on repeated games, the case where agents privately monitor the behavior of their opponents has been known for its intractability. This case is important as real-life relationships, where monitoring is not private, are even hard to imagine. It is now a famous open question whether the folk theorem extends to the case of private monitoring. <br/><br/> This project intends to address this open question. A recent working paper of Ely, Hoerner, and Olszewski studies a class of strategies that generalizes examples constructed in the literature for the Prisoners Dilemma. The Prisoners Dilemma strategies were more tractable than others. The paper provides a simple and sharp characterization of equilibrium payoffs that can be achieved by using those strategies. While those strategies can support a large set of payoffs, they are not rich enough to generate a folk theorem. <br/><br/>The research strategy in a follow-up study by Hoerner and Olszewski relies on progressive enlarging of the class of strategies, sacrificing as little tractability as possible but generating more equilibrium payoffs. It is believed that this strategy should lead at least to the folk theorem for all two-player games with almost-perfect monitoring. <br/><br/> Project 2: This project has been inspired by the potential of sets of lotteries as a modeling tool. Sets of lotteries have recently been used to model the preference for flexibility as well as self-control problems, such as temptation-driven preferences. A recent working paper of Olszewski uses them to provide an alternative model for studying ambiguity. Traditionally, ambiguity has been studied within the Savage setting, which instead of sets of lotteries considers mappings from a state space into the outcomes. Both ambiguity and temptation-driven preferences apply to a wide range of economically important situations, and there seem to be a demand for better tools to analyzing these phenomena. <br/><br/> It is believed that a model that considers correspondences from a state space into sets of lotteries would be not only an joint tool for studying several phenomena, but it would also respond to several possible criticisms of the existing models of the preference for flexibility and self-control problems. <br/><br/> Private monitoring in ongoing relationships, ambiguous information, and self-control problems are widely present in the surrounding us world. It is - referring to most standard examples - commonly believed that the studies on ambiguity contribute to the understanding of financial markets, in particular equity premium puzzle, and that the studies on private monitoring in repeated games have implications on collusive behavior in oligopoly markets and antitrust regulations. These projects will develop techniques for thinking about private monitoring within equilibrium setting, as well as it will improve tools for studying ambiguous information, and self-control problems. Private monitoring attracts attention from sociologists and anthropologists, while ambiguity and self-control problems are subjects of active research by psychologists."

The frustrating conundrum of silicate and oxide d18O analyses is that while many researchers are keen to use this technique, these analyses require the use of extremely hazardous reagents, and the level of operator skill and training required to perform these analyses is very high. The proposed new analytical technique is a safe, rapid, and simple technique. The new technique will interface a commercially-available very high temperature elemental analyzer to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer, and is a modification of an existing analytical technique that successfully uses a low temperature elemental analyzer to measure d18O of other materials. The new technique does not use any hazardous fluorination reagents such as F2 or BrF5, and the complexity of operation is relatively low. Preliminary experiments to measure oxygen concentrations using five commonly-analyzed minerals of geological interest (quartz, K-spar, plagioclase, olivine, and magnetite) indicate that these materials quantitatively react to form CO, which is then used to perform d18O analyses. All the necessary equipment for performing conventional and laser BrF5 oxygen isotope analyses are available at the University of Nevada-Reno, and will be used to verify the accuracy and precision of analyses performed using the newly developed technique. If the proposed technique proves to be successful, this will dramatically promote the use of this analysis in geosciences and related research. This will allow for increased accessibility for researchers, especially students, that currently would like to perform these analyses, but are dissuaded due to the safety hazards associated with the existing techniques. In turn, this should provide a significant stimulus to promote research into the fields of petrology and geochemistry."

(Pygoscelis adeliae, P. papua and P. antarctica, respectively) at Admiralty Bay, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Long-term data acquired annually since 1977 on these species including survival and recruitment, population size and breeding success, diets and foraging ecology, provide clear evidence linking offshore biological and physical processes to their effects on dependent predators in the Southern Ocean. These populations have exhibited fluctuations in abundance that have been related to long-term changes in environmental conditions, in particular sea ice coverage and its effects on krill availability. The present research will continue the long-term research to test hypotheses relating penguin breeding biology, foraging ecology and demography to environmental variability during the breeding season. In addition, the work will be expanded further address questions on the distribution and trophic interactions among the three species during the winter period. The approaches involve three foci: correlative analysis, winter ecology and population-dynamics modeling. Correlative analysis will be used to detect inter-annual trends in the predator data parameters over the 20-30 year periods for which there are data individual parameters. Winter studies will involve tracking foraging movements using satellite-tags and fatty acid signatures in egg yolk lipids will be used to examine the winter diets. The results from these studies will be incorporated into population-dynamic models. This study is one of the few ongoing research projects that have the historical data needed, from both land-based predator studies and marine surveys, to examine the effect of environmental variability on predator-prey interactions in the Southern Ocean. In terms of broader impacts, this research is a major contributor to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources Ecosystem Monitoring Program, an international effort designed in the mid-1980s to provide data for management purposes that would detect, monitor and predict the potential impacts of a new krill fishery on the prey (krill) and dependent predators (penguins, seals, whales) in the Southern Ocean. A group of key monitoring species were identified that were both obligate krill consumers and easily studied, among them were the main krill consuming genus, the Pygoscelis penguins. This project is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Marine Fisheries Service."

Does mathematics have a foundation, and if so, what is it? How do we know mathematical truths such as .5+7=12,. or the Pythagorean Theorem? There is still no consensus on the answers to these questions, and, despite advances in mathematics and mathematical logic during the last few centuries, Kant's deep influence on these debates is still felt. There are nevertheless important aspects of Kant's philosophy of mathematics that have not been properly understood, in no small part due to the tremendous changes in mathematics since the early modern period. Above all, Kant's philosophy of mathematics and mathematical cognition has been obscured by the centrality of his theory of magnitudes. Since the 19th century, numbers rather than magnitudes have played the central role in our understanding of mathematics. Intellectual Merit This research project will provide a new, systematic, and historically sensitive account of Kant's philosophy of mathematics based on his theory of magnitudes. It will revive a significant perspective on mathematics very different from the modern view, one that can offer insights into current debates. Both the early modern and Kant's understanding of magnitudes can be traced back to the Eudoxian theory of proportions found in Euclid's Elements. The Eudoxian theory rests on the cognition of the part-whole and equality relations of magnitudes, and Kant adopts this mereological approach to magnitudes in his own theory. His mereology of magnitudes contrasts sharply with the modern view, in which mathematics is founded on set theory. Furthermore, Kant holds that mathematical cognition requires a non-conceptual quasi-perceptual kind of mental representation he calls intuition.. The modern set-theoretic approach can be best described as appealing to conceptual representation alone. Reconstructing the early modern influences on Kant's thought and Kant's own theory of magnitudes will therefore articulate a very different way of looking at both mathematics and mathematical cognition. The first part of the project will investigate the early modern views of magnitude, number, and mathematical properties that influenced Kant.. Early modern views were in flux, however, and differed in important respects from the Greek mathematical tradition. Reconstructing the early modern views that influenced Kant will explain further aspects of Kant's own theory. The second part of the present project will further investigate Kant's own views on three important issues concerning the role of intuition in mathematical cognition. Together, the two parts will provide a complete, systematic account of Kant's philosophy of mathematics. The proposed project will build on earlier studies and will complete this work to provide a complete and systematic treatment of Kant's philosophy of mathematics. Broader Impacts The results will be widely disseminated; they will appear in various presentations, at least four articles, and will form the basis of a book. The project will more broadly impact the history of mathematics and will offer insight into contemporary debates in the philosophy of mathematics. The results of this research will be incorporated into undergraduate courses focusing on the interaction between philosophy, mathematics, and science during the scientific revolution. These courses put students in the position of a natural philosopher of the 17th and 18th centuries and ask them to reflect on magnitudes such as distance, force, and weight, beginning with levers and building up to a (simplified version) of Newton's derivation of the law of universal gravitation. A discussion of the mathematical character of magnitudes is an effective way to make mathematics and science accessible to humanities students while giving historical and philosophical understanding to science and engineering students. Further insight into the early modern view of magnitudes and their relation to mathematics will improve this successful pedagogical approach."

The co-organizers are Professor Sharon Traweek at the University of California, Los Angeles and Dr. Yoshinobu Takaiwa at the KEK High Energy Accelerator Research Organization in Japan. The purposes of the meeting are to: 1) gather and evaluate the specific methods and practices used for developing digital archives and for collecting cohort oral histories; 2) develop detailed strategies for achieving these goals; and 3) developing the collaboration to conduct this work. Collecting oral histories of cohorts who have worked together on specific projects or who have been members of an active network of colleagues will provide a significant contribution to the understanding of such cohorts and networks, especially how they have participated in the development of this distributed complexly structured international community of scientists. The methods of conducting these cohort oral histories are an important contribution to the anthropology and history of science and technology. The development of fully digital archives at KEK will provide an important opportunity for understanding how archives with materials in multiple languages and scripts should be designed. Initiating the design of an interactive digital portal for the archive while the archive is still in the formative stages will provide a model of how to establish an archive with open access. The resources of this digital archive will be available to all users worldwide, including other archives. Further, this trans-disciplinary, trans-national project can provide a model for how to bring together researchers from across the spectrum to work together on an important intellectual project of immediate and enduring interest and it can also be a model to other research institutes on how to design such projects for other archives. <br/><br/><br/>The co-organizers have complementary scientific expertise in the field. This enables them to evaluate and attract the best researchers to participate. The seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve postdocs and graduate students as both participants and observers. The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects. Following the seminar the organizers plan to widely disseminate the knowledge base and strategies via a website."

In particular, the lidar development will involve sensitive photon-counting detectors including a new infrared photon detector, a unique dual-polarized laser transmitter, and novel timing schemes to make Rayleigh-Mie-Raman (RMR) measurements from 5 to 90 km in altitude. Analysis of the RMR lidar measurements will provide unique vertical profiles of temperature and aerosol backscatter strength, extinction, shape and size from the arctic troposphere through the mesosphere with a vertical resolution of tens of meters and a temporal resolution of tens of minutes. These observations will be applicable to studies of polar stratospheric clouds, aerosols, and the vertical thermal structure of the winter arctic stratosphere. Remote operations will allow more event-driven operations, such as during stratospheric warming events, and, in general, more observing opportunities. The ultimate objective of the data transport system will be to make the lidar system accessible from remote locations and pave the way for the development of fully autonomous lidar systems. This capability would provide greater opportunity for lidar deployments in remote arctic locations with limited infrastructure. The observations will contribute to a distributed network of temperatures and aerosol measurements to support the Network for Detection of Stratospheric Change. The project will involve a graduate student, who will be trained in lidar technologies and stratospheric dynamics, and the data acquired will be rapidly and broadly disseminated for use by other researchers. Not only will the measurements and scientific results contribute to community-wide issues, but they will also be useful for calibration and validation of current and future spacecraft missions designed to observe middle atmosphere temperatures and aerosols."

The project explores these questions by empirically tracing public interest groups' claims and litigation regarding health hazards related to four areas: silicone breast implants, fast food, obesity, and guns. The PIs will use conventional framing analysis to follow legal mobilization in each policy area from disputants' stated or inferred objectives through news coverage of legal disputes and the broader issues that disputes raise to responses from attentive interest groups, official policy makers, and mass audiences. This will be accomplished through qualitative content analyses of publicly stated goals of adversaries; quantitative analysis of a large data set (2500 articles) sampling coverage of the policy issues in newsmagazines, newspapers, and wire services; interviews with group leaders and litigators, reporters and editors, and official policymakers; and analyses of available data on public opinion and conventional policy impacts of litigation. Findings will be published in a university press book, scholarly articles, popular news magazine articles, and a public website. Broader impacts will include significant research training experiences for graduate and undergraduate students as well as generation of important insights about current politics regarding health risks that are likely to be of great interest to issue activists, policy elites, and citizens generally."

Fundamentally, this project fits into our main educational objective: to integrate field studies into the education of diverse audiences, furthering their understanding of Earth surface processes and helping to bridge the gaps between theory and application as well as science and policy."

Wiseman, Jr."	08/31/2009	"$207,086.00"		jstoner@coas.oregonstate.edu	OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY	Corvallis	OR	973318507	5417374933	GEO	5280	"0000, 1079, OTHR"	$0.00	"ABSTRACT<br/>Stoner<br/>OPP-0520533<br/><br/>A lack of understanding of the geomagnetic field at high latitudes has been a fundamental<br/>limitation to understanding of the geodynamo process. An understanding of the Arctic's Holocene paleomagnetic record would fill this need and provide a valuable needed dating tools. The lack of Arctic paleomagnetic data results from the difficulty of Arctic logistics and with the added constraints of paleomagnetism. Through piggybacking Holocene paleomagnetic studies with several groups who specialize in the study of high Arctic lake sediments, the Principal Investigator shows through replicate records that Arctic sediments can accurately record the geomagnetic field. The inter-calibration of the paleomagnetic record with varve-based chronologies allows reconstruction of the first high Arctic high-resolution paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) and relative paleointensity (RPI) records (2700 yrs.). These records do not extend far enough back in time to answer questions on the relationship of the millennial scale variability between the geomagnetic field of the Arctic to that of the more thoroughly studied mid-latitudes. The Principal Investigator will continue this piggyback relationship to address issues of record length, development of dating curves and to assess spatial patterns of the PSV and RPI records. Coring expeditions schedule for the 2005 field season will significantly lengthen (from ~ 4.5 to ~ 20 m) sediment records. New opportunities are also available to spatial expand our observations with additional coring in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Alaskan Brooks Range and Svalbard. <br/>Intellectual Merit: Recent geomagnetic observations covering the last century, geodynamo theory, and modeling suggest that the polar geomagnetic field is unique and possibly substantially different from the rest of the Earth, but also a critical to piece to a global understanding. Results will temporally extend, spatially expand, and refine our understanding of the geomagnetic field of the High Arctic. If the polar field is unique, it should manifest as distinct secular variation behavior. Initial data suggest that it may be unique on decadal to centennial timescales, but possibly not at multi-centennial to millennial timescales and longer records are needed to test this. The data generated will provide the only high Arctic contribution to paleo spherical harmonic modeling initiatives. Dating of Arctic sediments is difficult, and limited to lakes producing varved sediments. Thus. paleo-studies are limited to a small subset of the potential archives that could provide high quality records. The Principal Investigator has demonstrated the inter-calibration of geomagnetic paleosecular variation with varve-based chronologies for the last 2700 yrs. and intends to extend this to the last 8000 yrs to produce a primary dating curve for the Arctic that can be used for both marine and terrestrial sediments.<br/>Broader Impacts: This research will place recent observations of dramatic migration of<br/>the North Magnetic Pole into a historical context to better assess the present geomagnetic behavior including the prominent collapse of geomagnetic field intensity and the possibility of an upcoming reversal that has been widely speculated on in press and television. This work will provide insights into the geographical distribution of historical aurora observations. Graduate student training will be a focus of this project. Through collaborations with the Svalbard REU Program, paleo-and-environmental magnetism will be a focus. Paleomagnetic datasets will be made available through contribution to the national geophysical data center and to other database and modeling initiatives that at present are completely devoid of high Arctic paleomagnetic data."

Haldane), at least an inordinate fondness for the study of this species-rich and life-history diverse lineage of insects. A team led by Dr. Brian Farrell at Harvard University, Dr. Michael Whiting at Brigham Young University, and Dr. David Maddison at the University of Arizona, with colleagues from around the world, will conduct an extensive study of beetle (insect order Coleoptera) phylogeny to provide the first broad scale view of beetle diversification. With ca. 350,000 described species, beetles comprise a huge fraction of the world's biota and are dominant in every terrestrial ecosystem. Beetles represent the most diverse and rapid radiation of any terrestrial organismal group, yet we have only a rudimentary knowledge of their deeper level phylogeny, and still do not understand even their most basic patterns of diversity. Collectively, beetles represent nearly every feeding habit among insects including herbivory and fungivory (feeding upon fungi), saprophagy (feeding upon decaying matter), predation and parasitism, and a thorough study of their evolutionary history would provide insight into the role of feeding habits in species diversity. The team of 40 leading beetle researchers worldwide, with expertise in nearly every beetle lineage, proposes to construct a framework phylogeny (genealogical tree) for all beetles, utilizing a 3-tier approach. Tier 1: 54 exemplar species, representing all major beetle lineages, will be sampled extensively for character data (morphology plus 23kb of DNA sequence data including complete mitochondrial genomes) to provide a robust outline of the relationships among the major (superfamily) groups of beetles. Tier 2: 300 additional species will sampled for morphology and 12kb of sequence data to establish relationships among beetle families. Tier 3: 3000 additional species will be sequenced for 1.5 kb of DNA sequence data, with morphology added for a subset of these, to better characterize the grand diversity of beetle phylogeny at the subfamilial level. <br/>Novel bioinformatics tools will be developed to streamline data processing for the molecular and morphological data, and will allow for greater efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility of the data and associated results, while providing an online framework for collaboration by participants throughout the world. This represents the first time that coleopterists have collaborated on such a large-scale phylogenetic project, and the work should result in a robust estimate of beetle phylogeny that will provide a predictive basis for classification and integration of information on this ecologically and economically important group of insects. Information on all aspects of beetles will be disseminated through the Tree-of-Life website hosted at the University of Arizona, a traveling Spanish-language / English-language museum exhibit, and through publications and symposia. This research will provide training for graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students, including 10 female researchers and an undergraduate student with disabilities."

By both sharing resources and best practices across the alliance and including SBE fields in existing AGEP programs, the CUNY/MAA Alliance for the SBE sciences will increase participation in summer research programs, expand recruitment and research opportunities for social sciences students, further develop targeted relationships with minority-serving institutions, provide across the alliance student mentoring and mentoring training for faculty, coordinate skill building workshops to help ensure graduate study success, expand student support groups, enhance fellowship support, increase teaching opportunities and expand teacher training workshops, increase the support of students attending professional workshops, and expand postdoctoral and early career education. The intellectual merit of the project will focus on the advancement of education by enhancing existing excellent educational programs and providing SBE students at the graduate, postdoctoral and early career stages with additional experiences that they would not normally receive. The impact of these interventions will be evaluated and best practices shared widely. Our experiences will enhance knowledge on the methodologies critical to the process of the professionalization of social and behavioral scientists. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. The broader impact of the project will develop through the institutionalization of a larger pool of individuals studying and conducting research in the social sciences through the utilization of effective strategies that will attract, motivate, and train domestic talent, especially among underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities.

The goals include increasing the number of minority students enrolled, the establishment of permanent infrastructure on each campus to support diversity, the establishment of permanent programs on each campus and across the alliance to support diversity and a diverse population of graduate students, and the development of a publishable set of techniques and guidelines that can be used by any university and which we hope will lead to a national forum for the exchange of ideas and best practices for promoting diversity. The four key elements of the alliance include: 1) alliance-level activities (e.g., an annual student research conference and the creation of common recruiting materials and coordinated recruiting efforts; 2) recruitment through the implementation of an Alliance Visiting Scholars Program and coordination of recruiting efforts at major conferences, fairs and university visits; 3) increased retention of students by recruiting a cadre of social and behavioral professors and scholars who will provide instant, multi-level mentoring network and developing transition programs; and 4) increased activities and programs targeted at undergraduates in a wider range of universities and colleges to increase the pool of students. The number of universities in the alliance will allow the alliance to analyze the effectiveness of new strategies for broadening participation and the transference of existing techniques to new settings. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The alliance will develop written materials that can be distributed to all universities in the US and could be the basis for a national exchange of ideas about alliances as a strategy to broaden participation in US institutions of higher learning."

This system will be superior to most near coastal ocean models, which are typically wind driven but not contamination transport driven, in that our new model will be both. These objectives will be accomplished through the dynamic injection of observed ocean data into multiscale mathematical models and computer simulations. The project will create research topics in multiscale mathematics, statistics, and software application integration with a flexible, Grid-based<br/>database and problem solving environment. The project will follow an integrated approach that addresses technical issues at each step of the process: 1) the dynamic simulation instructs the sensors what to look for and reprograms it for those analytes, 2) the sensors report to the simulation the new observed data, and 3) the simulation then incorporates the new data, updates its predictions, and reprograms the sensors as necessary in a closed loop. We will reduce the amount of human intervention needed to monitor spills and other contamination events, making DDDAS viable for sensors going to locations that are difficult to communicate with the sensors in real-time (e.g., an unreliable satellite link or another planetary body in the future). The work will build on the successful results of research previously funded by the NSF, including the SURA Coastal Ocean Observation and Prediction and two ITR projects to develop algorithms, error controls, and<br/>middleware to optimally manage provably scalable computing resources for Grid computing. The project has the ultimate objective to guide the development of hardware and software to enable performing both lab and ocean test, but these tasks will be relegated for follow-on efforts to the present project.

Initially, gliders will be employed to occupy a single cross-shelf section in a region of relatively simple bathymetry (north of Heceta Bank, along a regularly-occupied hydrographic line). This effort will involve two Webb Research Corporation 200-m gliders (already owned by the PIs) operating serially to provide continuous time series. During the second year, the PIs request support for a third, 1000-m capable glider to be added to the rotation which will then include a second line, south of Heceta Bank, to measure wind-driven response over complex bathymetry. Gliders require roughly 5 days to traverse each section, yielding four crossings per 20-day mission. The three-year record of sections will be combined with remote sensing data, moored time series and numerical simulations to examine weather-band to interannual variability in water mass properties, stratification and along-shelf transport, evaluate how wind-forcing and bathymetry govern coastal jet separation and to test two-dimensional upwelling and downwelling front models. The study addresses a suite of important issues in coastal dynamics using a technology that permits year-round sampling. With three years of sections repeated at 5-day intervals, sampling will capture multiple realizations of target processes. Frequent section occupations under a range of forcing conditions will provide an exceptional data set for examining how variable wind and buoyancy forcing interact with differing underlying bathymetry to govern evolution of the coastal jet. The combination of long time series and weather-band temporal resolution will lend a statistical confidence to the results beyond that normally available."

It is not yet known whether these differences are inborn, develop as a result of long-term stimulation/training during critical periods of brain development, or can be attributed to a combination of the two. Research has also demonstrated that music training in children results in long-term enhancement of visual-spatial, verbal, and mathematical performance. However, the underlying neural basis of such enhancements, and whether or not learning and practicing a musical instrument can induce these enhancements, is yet unknown. In the fall of 2002, a pilot longitudinal study funded by the National Science Foundation began to compare children who were about to start instrumental music training with those who were not. At baseline, the groups showed no significant differences in morphometric and functional brain parameters or in results of motor, auditory, and cognitive tests. However, after 15 months of observation, significant differences had emerged in some primary domains (motor and auditory skills) as well as in melodic and rhythmic processing during functional brain imaging studies, but no cognitive transfer effects have yet been seen. With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Schlaug and Winner will continue to follow the original sample of young children for three additional years in order to test the following hypotheses: (1) Children in the instrumental group should show greater improvement on all cognitive outcomes, more brain growth in areas previously found to be enlarged in adult musicians, and a left-hemispheric shift in the functional brain correlates of music processing; (2) Training intensity should predict level of change on all outcome parameters; (3) String training may show different effects on the sensorimotor system than those shown by keyboard training; (4) Skill at reading notation should predict performance on visual-spatial tasks and subtests of math that require spatial reasoning, proportion, and ratio; (5) Skill in music processing should predict performance on phonemic awareness. <br/><br/>This project will demonstrate the relationship of skill acquisition, learning, and the effect of transfer to structural and functional brain changes during critical periods of brain maturation, all of which have important implications for early childhood education. Transfer is a key issue in educational theory that has both applied and theoretical value since it helps us to understand how mental capacities are organized and related to one another. This research will provide testable hypotheses with regard to the neural basis of transfer. While music education should never be justified solely in terms of its impact on extra-musical learning, the discovery of cognitive transfer from music learning and the neural basis of such transfer would be an important, beneficial ""side-effect"" of music training."

Because front speeds are part of the large time<br/>(large scale) behavior of solutions to stochastic reaction-diffusion <br/>equations, one needs a large domain size, sufficient resolution of front <br/>structures, and many realizations of random samples. The <br/>variational principles are established<br/>by exploiting the analytical and probabilistic properties of solutions. <br/>Significant dimensional reductions are achieved so that only<br/>associated linear problems need to be solved to find principal<br/>eigenvalues or Lyapunov exponents. Besides being a useful tool for <br/>analysis of speed statistics, the variational principles also help to <br/>generate fast and efficient computational algorithms. The project will<br/>explore this approach to study front speeds in various space/time random <br/>media, the speed asymptotic laws and the dependence on statistics of <br/>random media.<br/><br/>The project is motivated by flame fronts in the environment (forest or <br/>building fires) and internal combustion engines of vehicles, where fluid <br/>(air or liquid) motion could alter the speed of burning process<br/>significantly. The fluid motion often contains uncertainties and<br/>can be best described as random media. Scientific understanding<br/>and efficient computing of front speeds can help to control the<br/>spread of flames, and minimize the waste gases from the combustion engines<br/>to benefit the environment. The methods being developed in the project <br/>will contribute to both the understanding and computing<br/>of random fronts, a subject largely in its infancy."

The framework is distinguished by four phases that are performed continually with dynamically-obtained data over the lifetime of the hazardous event. (1) Measurement: Distributed sensors provide dynamic measurements over a specified time horizon that will be used to reconstruct the initial conditions of the event. (2) Inversion: Driven by the sparse measurements, an inverse problem is solved to estimate the initial conditions for the equations governing the evolution of the hazard. (3) Prediction: Statistical analysis of the inversion results permits estimation of the uncertainty in the initial conditions, which is propagated into a prediction of the evolution of the hazard and its uncertainty. (4) Steering: Sensors are steered to new locations based on an effectivity index that incorporates sensitivities of the inversion with respect to sensor location, estimated uncertainty in the prediction, and population density factors. Continual application of the measure-invert-predict-steer (MIPS) framework described above results in updated predictions of the evolving hazard with built-in uncertainty estimates, as well as revised sensor deployment strategies that refine the predictions to reduce their uncertainty. The methods developed consider two time scales of decision making at which the MIPS framework must execute. The seconds-to-minutes decision-making scale is required by first responders to begin immediate response efforts. For such time scales, high-fidelity models in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) are too formidable. Instead, the proposed methods will construct reduced-order models of the PDEs to facilitate realtime execution of the MIPS framework. The minutes-to-hours decision-making scale permits more careful and measured response by emergency officials using high-fidelity, high-resolution PDE models. To enable rapid execution of the MIPS cycle for such models, the project will develop fast, scalable, parallel algorithms for inversion and prediction. To demonstrate, assess, harden, robustify, and the resulting framework, will be validated on a specific application testbed: prediction of the urban/regional dispersion of intentionally- or accidentally-released atmospheric contaminants from sparse measurements."

MEIBURG<br/>INSTITUTION: UNIV. OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA<br/><br/>The researchers funded under this grant will use analytical and computational tools to investigate and document the instability of two miscible fluids at low Re with annular stratification of density and viscosity in vertical and inclined tubes. Recent research has revealed the surprising result that miscible fluids, in contrast to their immiscible counterparts, are unstable according to linear stability analysis. This raises fundamental questions regarding the relationship between miscible and immiscible interfacial fluid dynamics, which are often assumed to display corresponding instabilities. Preliminary investigations of linear stability will be continued under this grant, and direct numerical simulation (DNS) studies will explore nonlinear instability. The merit of the proposed work is its investigation of this recently identified and potentially important instability of fundamental interest in fluid mechanics. The ability to predict behavior of variable viscosity and density miscible fluid flows is important for a host of processes in the chemical, pharmaceutical and oil industries. Low Reynolds number flows are particularly relevant to microfluidics applications in the biomedical and space areas. Students involved in this research will benefit by their participation with an ongoing NSF IGERT program in Computational Science and Engineering at UCSB. The PI's service at Prairie View A&M University gives strong evidence of a commitment to diversity in graduate student recruitment and education.

The successful design of optimal liquid propellant storage tanks for spacecraft has produced specific knowledge of capillary flows and phenomena in containers that largely consist of baffles and interconnected interior corners. In the proposed theoretical and experimental investigation, methods of analysis developed for capillary flows in large complex containers in space are applied to microscale networks of interconnected repeat units to develop design methodologies to compute optimal geometries for high performance microporous materials and structures on Earth. The specific objectives of the research focus on the optimization of high performance wick structures employed in advanced two-phase passive cooling systems for microelectronic thermal control. Experimental verification of theoretically determined structures and performance is pursued through fabrication and testing of the media. The research is novel in its representation and use of the governing transport equations in a cell-by-cell approach to compute optimal pore structures in the low saturation limit where the media may be effectively modeled as a nodal network of interconnected interior corners and solved by matrix methods. A close connection between microfabrication methods and theory development is established in this research team providing a foundation from which a comprehensive methodology for cost effective high performance structures can be established. New structures considering benign fabrication methods optimizing fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, thermal capacitance and conductivity, strength, and media mass are pursued as well as methods to analyze traditional randomized media. The 'all analytic' method proposed does not employ empirically determined constants or highly varying numerical coefficients. Example pore geometries solved to date clearly identify the origins of manifold improvements possible in select porous structures. Applications for such methods improve transport processes in porous media, fabrics, fuel cells, membranes, and Lab-On-Chip modules. The impact of this work extends to ground water flows, oil recovery processes, and biological systems. The project will support the work of at least one post-doctoral researcher, one graduate student, and six undergraduate students."

We already know that it can drive diversification in morphology and ecology among more-or-less isolated populations in ecological time. An important next question is whether this variation persists in such a way as to contribute to generating species diversity, or if it is lost amidst changing ecological context. This project provides a first test of this question. It uses the obligate, beneficial relationship between the well-known Joshua Tree and its exclusive pollinators, two yucca moth species. These moths occur either alone or coexist in different parts of the joshua tree range. It is an excellent model because the association has persisted for a very long time, and plant and moth traits have diversified between and within the species. Furthermore, the geographic range of joshua tree is highly fragmented and has a well-understood history of variable connectivity during past climate regimens. Specifically, the project will use molecular and morphological data to test predictions about historical gene flow, current isolation, and morphological variation. Together they can provide strong answers to the question about the role of coevolution in driving speciation. <br/><br/> The results will be of immediate broader utility in conservation biology, as the answers would affect genetically informed conservation strategies, and in climate change biology, where yuccas are sensitive indicator species. Being a species of great public interest and a symbol of the Mojave desert, and a key species for maintenance of desert communities, the results will have immediate application for public agencies. In a broader educational context, yuccas and yucca moths figure prominently in textbooks, and in public education settings such as science centers and parks. The project will further outreach in these areas, and provide public and ranger education in parks and monuments."

While the elastic properties of carbon nanotubes are well understood, the plastic properties of carbon nanotubes remain unsettled. Intriguingly, carbon nanotubes are expected to deform plastically through the nucleation of dislocation dipoles (Stone-Wales defects), the dissociation of these dipoles, and the subsequent motion of the dislocations. Estimates of the formation energy for Stone-Wales defects vary widely, perhaps because their formation energy is influenced by elastic interactions between the defects. We will use elasticity theory solutions for periodic dislocation arrays to analyze defect formation energies obtained from density functional theory based total energy methods. This analysis will yield core radii for the dislocations and ultimately, a transferable theory of dislocations in nanotubes. This theory can then be applied to model plasticity in carbon nanotubes under a variety of loading conditions."

The long-term changes occurring at these colonies are representative of changes throughout the Ross Sea, where 30% of all Adelie penguins reside, and are in some way related to changing climate. The recent grounding of two very large icebergs against Ross and Beaufort islands, with associated increased variability in sea-ice extent, has provided an unparalleled natural experiment affecting wild, interannual swings in colony productivity, foraging effort, philopatry and recruitment. Results of this natural experiment can provide insights into the demography and geographic population structuring of this species, having relevance Antarctic-wide in understanding its future responses to climate change as well as interpreting its amazingly well known Holocene history. This ongoing study will continue to consider the relative importance of resources that constrain or enhance colony growth (nesting habitat, access to food); the aspects of natural history that are affected by exploitative or interference competition among neighboring colonies (breeding success, foraging effort); climatic factors that influence the latter, especially sea ice patterns; and behavioral mechanisms that influence colony growth as a function of initial size and location (emigration, immigration). An increased effort will focus on understanding factors that affect over-winter survival. The hypothesis is that the age structure of Cape Crozier has changed over the past thirty years and no longer reflects the smaller colonies nearby. Based on recent analyses, it appears that the Ross Island penguins winter in a narrow band of sea ice north of the Antarctic Circle (where daylight persists) and south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (where food abounds). More extensive winter ice takes the penguins north of that boundary where they incur higher mortality. Thus, where a penguin winters may be due to the timing of its post-breeding departure (which differs among colonies), which affects where it first encounters sea ice on which to molt and where it will be transported by the growing ice field. Foraging effort and interference competition for food suggested as factors driving the geographic structuring of colonies. The research includes a census of known-age penguins, studies of  foraging effort and overlap among colonies; and identification of the location of molting and wintering areas. Information will be related to sea-ice conditions as quantified by satellite images. Demographic and foraging-effort models will be used to synthesize results. The iceberg natural experiment is an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the demographics of a polar seabird and its response to climate change.

In the PI's previous work, the PI's extended this theory in order to interpret and evaluate the design of the WTO. This work provided an economic interpretation for the principle of reciprocity, the most-favored nation (MFN) rule, and the role of retaliatory tariffs in sustaining a selfenforcing trade agreement. The PI's also extended the theory to evaluate proposed and actual WTO rules that concern labor and environmental policies, competition policies, export and domestic subsidies, and preferential trading agreements. <br/><br/>With the basic theoretical structure in place, this proposal moves forward and considers three fundamental<br/>questions. First, does the theory have empirical support? While some recent work has provided important evidence, to the PI's knowledge there has not yet been an attempt to investigate empirically the central prediction of the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements, namely, that governments use trade agreements to escape from a terms-of-trade-driven Prisoners' Dilemma. Building on their past theoretical work, the PI's provide a characterization of this prediction: countries that are relatively bigger importers of a product in the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium should agree to larger negotiated tariff reductions on that product in a trade agreement. The PI's then formulate an empirical strategy that begins with the observation that a number of countries bound their tariffs for the first time in the Uruguay Round. Interpreting the (un-bound) tariffs that these countries reported at the beginning of the round as their non-cooperative tariffs, the PI's propose an empirical investigation of the hypothesis that those countries that import a greater share of world exports for a given product at the beginning of the Uruguay Round also offer a larger concession (ad valorem tariff reduction) for that product at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Their initial empirical findings offer support for the terms-of-trade theory, and they propose several important extensions of our basic empirical strategy. <br/><br/>While models of asymmetric information have generated numerous insights in other fields, very little attention has been given to the potential role that private-information considerations may play in the design and implementation of trade agreements. This omission may reflect the fact that trade agreements are self-enforcing, and it is only recently that game-theoretic tools have been developed with which to derive predictions in dynamic games with private information. The PI's second key question is thus: Does the inclusion of private information generate new interpretations and evaluations of WTO rules? To address this question, the PI's propose a repeated trade-policy game in which governments have privately observed political shocks. Using this model, the PI's then offer new interpretations of the weak-binding rule and the WTO Safeguard Agreement. The PI's also propose new work that considers the design of anti-dumping rules.<br/><br/>The WTO dispute settlement procedures (DSP) are widely admired but also raise important concerns. In light<br/>of these concerns, the PI's ask a third question: What are the implications of the terms-of-trade theory for key concerns that have been raised with respect to the WTO DSP? The PI's first consider the Mexican proposal that retaliation rights be made tradable. This proposal comes from a concern that the DSP is not effective for small and developing countries. To better understand the potential implications of the Mexican proposal, the PI's construct a model in which retaliation rights are auctioned. The PI's propose to evaluate different auction formats according to revenue and efficiency criteria. The PI's consider the WTO agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures (the SCM Agreement). A concern here is that the agreement may block the use of a subsidy that may be an efficient instrument with which to achieve a legitimate domestic objective (e.g., income stabilization for farmers). The terms-of-trade theory provides some support for this<br/>concern, and the PI's propose research that would highlight the advantage of an alternative approach that emphasizes ""rebalancing"". The PI's propose to show that a DSP that emphasizes re-balancing would embody a familiar notion from law and economics: efficient breach. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The PI's expect that their empirical work will establish an empirical foundation for the terms-of-trade theory and encourage a number of new empirical evaluations of the predictions of this theory. Their proposed work on trade agreements with private information will generate new understandings of the benefits and possible costs of certain WTO rules and thereby offer constructive theoretical input toward the design of a better world trading system. In the same spirit, the analysis of the DSP will provide constructive theoretical input for important and on-going debates with regard to the optimal design of the WTO. The new theoretical work will also provide methodological contributions that should facilitate future work by other trade-policy theorists. ThePI's will also continue to develop their interactions with WTO legal<br/>scholars, in order to gain from their expertise and provide opportunity for their research to find influence in legal circles as well. Finally, the PI's will teach the proposed research in their respective graduate trade classes, and they will continue to produce Ph.D. students whose research analyzes the economics of the WTO."

It constitutes a critical infrastructure in the economic and social fabric of, not only our nation, but the developed and, increasingly, the developing world. Recently, the Internet has become a powerful mechanism for propagating malicious software programs. These have been designed to annoy (e.g., deface web pages), spread misinformation (e.g., false news reports or stock quotes), deny service (e.g., corrupt hard disks), steal financial information (e.g., VISA card numbers), enable remote login (e.g., Trojan horses), etc. Moreover, they have been used to disrupt normal operations within the Internet itself. Furthermore, the potential for significant network disruptions is extremely high. It is well known that a single misconfigured BGP router on April 25th, 1997 effectively shut down most of the major Internet backbones for up to two hours, unleashing a sequence of cascading failures. If an accidentally misconfigured router can wreak such havoc, one can only imagine what a carefully orchestrated attack can produce in the way of disruptions.<br/><br/>Although malicious activities have appeared on many occasions, to date there appears to be no well-defined methodology for predicting their behavior and the damage that they can cause. This proposal describes research aimed at developing sound mathematically-based methodologies that can be used to better understand the characteristics of different network attacks, and to detect and estimate their parameters. More specifically, the proposed research will focus on the following areas.<br/><br/>o Mathematical models of network attacks. The researcher will develop a modelling methodology based on fluid models and networked Markov chains (NMCs). These models will be used to answer questions such as: how does network topology affect the spread of an Internet worm? What conditions must an attack meet to be considered virulent (severe)?<br/><br/>o Detection and parameter estimation. The researchers will develop detection and parameter estimation techniques for different types of monitors, based on the exponential growth trend in the early stage of the network attacks, with fluid models and point process models, respectively. They will also develop ""hypothesis testing"" based detection methods and study the performance and the impact in the defense strategies.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the analysis methodology produced by this research will have broad applicability in the design and analysis of failure and attack scenarios in large complex man made systems such as the power grid.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project will generate new techniques for studying and detecting different network attacks (e.g., worms, email viruses, BGP infrastructure attacks). Furthermore, the project will enhance our understanding of how failures can propagate throughout a large distributed system like the Internet, and, more generally, large man-made systems.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project integrates research and education of graduate and undergraduate students through the close interaction and mentoring of students by project faculty. We will also seek international involvement with Universities in Brazil in the form of joint courses/seminars."

The features of this technology are as follows: (1) Automatic filtering of questions. During Phase I, Language Computer Corporation (LCC) developed a system that decomposes high-level questions into low-level, fact-seeking questions. Some of these questions, however, turn out to be nonsensical. In Phase II, the firm proposes to submit all of the decomposed questions to a knowledge-based system, which will eliminate questions that are inconsistent with tacit knowledge. All of the questions that survive filtering will be passed back for processing by the question-answering system. (2) Aligning domain ontologies with a large reference ontology. During Phase I, LCC developed a tool that generates domain ontologies from raw text. During Phase II, the firm will extend this tool so that the domain ontologies are automatically aligned with an overarching domain-independent ontology. This alignment will permit deeper expansion of query concepts, because it will allow domain-independent concepts to be augmented with domain-dependent content. (3) Formal evaluation of semantic relations. The foundation of the question-answering system is semantic relations extracted from queries and documents. These relations will be evaluated to assess the relative contribution of each one to question answering. The result of this evaluation will establish which aspects of semantics are most useful to question- answering.<br/><br/>This project will have a direct impact in the following areas: (1) The system can be deployed in commercial and government settings where the accuracy, coverage, reliability, and usability of the retrieved information are crucial. Ideal applications for the technology include homeland defense, CRM, education, medicine, and the law. (2) The system bridges the gap between domain-independent and domain-specific content. Domain ontologies are constructed automatically, and these ontologies are automatically aligned with a large reference ontology, so that queries can be simultaneously expanded into the terms appropriate to many different domains."

For example, fully 87 percent of students have worked during at least one month of high school by May of their senior year, and many employed students work at high intensity, generally considered over 20 hours per week. In addition, almost one in four employed seniors (23%) works full time at over 35 hours per week. But empirical work stretching back to the early 1980s establishes that long work hours in combination with school enrollment are correlated with elevated involvement in a variety of problem behaviors, not the least of which are crime and substance use. Partly on the basis of the research showing adverse effects of extensive work involvement on problem behavior, the National Research Council (1998:227) proposed extending federal limits on youth work involvement during the school year-which currently apply to 14 and 15 year olds only-to 16 and 17 year olds. This recommendation was adopted in the Youth Worker Protection Act, a bill introduced in the 108th Congress. <br/><br/>This recommendation represents an example of how sociological research can lead directly to public policy recommendation, and at the very least to a change in attitudes on the part of policymakers. Indeed, in the 1970s, three federal government panels recommended an increase in employment for adolescents. Yet the research in question does not directly address the proposal made by the National Research Council. In their recommendation, the NRC infers that the movement into the labor market that accompanies the relaxation of child labor laws at age 16 leads to increased problem behavior. But the research that led to this recommendation is based on the cross-sectional correlation between work intensity and problem behavior with, at best, a control for previous offending. Knowing that youths who work longer hours have more problem behavior than youth who work fewer, controlling for observables, does not in itself prove that youths will increase their problem behavior as a result of an increase in work involvement. Indeed, recent econometric work cautions that the adverse work intensity effect observed in prior studies may be driven by inattention to unobserved heterogeneity, and that longer work hours may have no causal impact or may under some circumstances reduce delinquent involvement.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The PI maps state-to-state variation in child labor laws at ages 16 and 17 onto changes in self-reported work and problem behavior for youths in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. The study will examine what happens to problem behavior, job quality, and other dimensions of youth work as a result of the change in policy regime from federal to state laws at age 16. The study pays special attention to the interaction between labor market conditions and these laws, in part because it is unlikely that the laws will be as relevant in loose labor markets as they are in tight labor markets where there is a demand for youth labor. The general procedure gives the PI the ability to shed light on the potential consequences of expanding federal restrictions to cover 16 and 17 year olds. This the first study that so directly explores the policy recommendation from the NRC. This approach will also provide new quasi-experimental evidence for the sociological question regarding the causal relationship between work and youth behavior. Study results will be unique in that they derive their power from legislative variation that is of direct interest to policymakers, and as such, will be of interest to both social scientists and policymakers.<br/><br/>."

The project adapts and implements educational materials produced by the Integrated Data Analysis (IDA) project (NSF Award 0089006), making them more accessible to instructors and students at career-oriented and technical institutions. The data analysis modules combine sociology and quantitative methods in an active learning environment. The modules mix course material on American society with data analysis using data from the U.S. Census, the General Social Survey, and other sources. The Adventures in Sociology Project is designed to achieve the following outcomes: (1) increase quantitative literacy and data analysis skills among first and second-year college students; (2) teach basic scientific concepts and; (3) increase students' understanding of sociological theory and data; and (4) deliver data analysis to audiences who have never learned it. All of these outcomes serve to increase preparedness and retention of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit of Proposed Activity<br/>In their current form, several obstacles prevent the IDA exercises from reaching students outside the specific environments for which they were developed. Instructors wishing to use the existing modules must undertake significant revision and customization in order to transport them to their courses. Currently, implementation of many IDA modules requires acquiring and developing expertise in proprietary data analysis software linked to the IDA project. It involves creating and integrating step-by-step instructions for data analysis with links to course concepts. Implementation also currently requires determining the best course locations for each module. These start-up costs present a significant barrier for instructors at technical colleges and career-oriented institutions like UW-Stout where the teaching load is significantly heavier than at the traditional liberal arts environments for which most of the IDA modules were developed. The Adventures in Sociology Project solves these problems by converting the modules into ready-to-go handouts that can be easily inserted (as individual assignments or as a collection) into almost any introductory sociology course. After adaptation, the exercises will not require proprietary computer software or specialized technical knowledge. They will rely on standard word processing and spreadsheet software packages. They will be linked to a generic course outline (developed by a Task Force of the American Sociological Association) so that their implementation is straightforward. The immediate goal of the project is to adapt, implement and assess 18 data analysis modules in eight courses over a three-year period. Adapted modules will be implemented in introductory sociology courses at UW-Stout and will be disseminated on a public Internet site, currently in pilot form at www.adventuresinsociology.net. The Adventures will be promoted at teacher training workshops and professional conferences. UW-Stout students, along with students at other career-oriented and technical institutions, are substantively targeted by the project. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity<br/>The Adventures in Sociology Project brings high-quality educational materials to broader audiences. The project advances science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education by infusing quantitative reasoning into lower division general education courses. The project is designed to make STEM education more accessible to women and minorities by presenting quantitative data analysis in the more approachable context of the social world. Context has been found to be pivotal to the success of traditionally underrepresented groups. Bringing quantitative analysis to courses outside the traditional STEM curriculum helps increase the preparedness of students entering those fields and also increases their self-confidence."

It will combine<br/>systematic field- and laboratory-based experiments and measurement of the changes in Si-isotope<br/>composition in solid and aqueous phases in order to isolate the reactions that are most strongly<br/>responsible for driving changes in d30Si values. The experiments target the following processes in which<br/>Si participates: 1) dissolution of primary and secondary minerals, 2) precipitation of secondary minerals,<br/>3) the combined impact of near-simultaneous dissolution and precipitation reactions, and 4) the integrated<br/>aspects of weathering, leaching and clay synthesis. The first 3 of these experiments will be in-lab benchtop<br/>experiments; and the fourth will utilize two ongoing experiments at the US Geological Survey, one<br/>utilizing leaching columns, the other a well-monitored soil chronosequence. The first 3 experiments<br/>simplify soil processes to insure maximum interpretability whereas the column and field experiments<br/>measure the integrated results of complex soil forming processes. The chronosequence is in arkosic parent<br/>material, and thus will add a useful dimension to an existing database on silicon isotopic changes<br/>associated with progressive weathering in the Hawaiian basaltic chronosequence.<br/>Chemical weathering unlocks elements from the lithosphere allowing them to participate in dynamic<br/>biogeochemical reactions in terrestrial and ultimately marine systems. Silicon is the second most<br/>abundant element in the Earth's crust and the dominant solute in rivers that drain continents supplying at<br/>least 80% of the dissolved Si entering oceans. The broader impact of this proposal lies in the importance<br/>of capturing the power of Si isotopes as a tracer for silicate weathering, and the subsequent participation<br/>of Si in Earth surface and ecosystem processes. Silicate weathering is critical for buffering acid rain, for<br/>long-term regulation of atmospheric CO2, and is the ultimate source of dissolved Si in natural waters.<br/>Silicon's abundance, chemical reactivity, and the variation in the structural stability of its host minerals<br/>ensure that it persists in soils even as its loss supports downstream ecosystems and as it accumulates in<br/>sedimentary deposits. The proposed research will augment understanding of the global Si cycle, and<br/>specifically the weathering-controlled transfer of Si from continents to oceans."

Ecological inference and predictions are currently limited by the many sources of variability that operate at a range of scales. There are, however, powerful tools available for analyzing processes characterized by these sources of uncertainty and variation, including hierarchical Bayes and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. However, the widespread use of these techniques in ecology has been hindered due to limited training options. The 2nd Summer Institute will follow the format of the highly successful 1st Institute held in June 2004. Participants will include advanced graduate student and postdoctoral associates selected by an open application process. Leading statisticians and ecologists will provide day-long presentations and hands-on training with computational techniques. Students will participate in small working groups, with the aim of producing a published volume and lecture notes. The 2nd Summer Institute will take place in 2006, retaining aspects of the format that worked well in the 1st Institute, and incorporating modifications that will improve its effectiveness.<br/><br/>By training a select group of quantitative environmental scientists who will in turn train others and use this training in their research, this 'summer school' will expedite the spread and use of modern statistical computation techniques. Adoption of these modern methods by ecologists and earth scientists will strengthen the field of ecological forecasting, enhance its reputation, and increase its usefulness to resource managers and policy makers. Many of the techniques that will be covered should directly enhance capacity to use network information available in distributed databases."

This project develops methods for reconstructing past water chemistry and food webs of lakes. The biological and chemical deposits in surface sediment samples will be compared with the water in 62 modern lakes. The resulting relationships will be tested by comparing sediment cores with 24 years of observations from the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research (NTL-LTER) site. The methods will then be used to reconstruct 150 years of history for several lakes, adding perspective to the long-term observations of the NTL-LTER and testing the prediction that lakes high in the local landscape had more severe and longer-lasting effects of 19th century logging than low lakes that are more influenced by groundwater. This research will also help to understand the response of lakes to severe droughts that last decades to centuries by identifying periods of low lake levels during the last 10,000 years. Understanding the variability of the responses of lakes to climate change and disturbance is essential to predicting the responses of particular lakes to future changes in land use and climate. <br/>This project will bring together expertise from several strong programs at the University of Wisconsin (the Center for Limnology, Botany, the Center for Climatic Research, NTL-LTER, and UW-LaCrosse), with the Limnological Research Center and LacCORE National Lacustrine Core Repository at the University of Minnesota and the United States Geologic Survey Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical Budgets (WEBB) project. Cores collected in this project will be archived at LacCORE and made available to future researchers, forging important new links between the LTER network, the paleoecology and paleoclimate communities, and groundwater scientists at the USGS. Two graduate students and at least 10 undergraduates will participate, and the project will contribute to the Limnology Explorers program, an interdisciplinary educational experience for middle school students coordinated by the NTL-LTER and the UW Center for Biology Education as part of the SchoolYard LTER initiative."

Non-invasive manipulation of biological cells with light is an important tool for basic biological research. Opto-plasmonic tweezers use polarized light to excite localized surface-plasmon resonance, which consists of a collection of oscillating electrical dipoles, on a metal nanoparticle array. The orientation of these dipoles is parallel to the polarization direction of the light. They generate a patterned-radiation electric field that manipulates the cells through dielectrophoretic interactions, with orientation control dependent on the polarization of the light. Low optical intensity can be achieved due to the high gradient of the radiation field. A micromachined polarization controller will also be fabricated as the first step towards micro-instrumentation. The micro-polarization controller is expected to achieve sub-millisecond response time and therefore can achieve fast rotation control of the biological cells. <br/><br/>This is a new instrument for manipulating single biological cells non-invasively using light. Such capability is important in biological research and applications. A chief virtue of the technology is its ability to rotate the cells with high resolution by changing the polarization direction of the light, which cannot be achieved by most of the optical manipulation approaches. Such capability opens the door to building structured biomaterials for potential applications in constructing biofilms and human tissue engineering. This instrument will also be miniaturized using micromachining technology so that it will have a small footprint and low cost. The success of this project will open up new directions for optical manipulations in biological research. This project will also give students valuable experience in doing interdisciplinary research."

Billions of larvae are produced each year by benthic invertebrates, and probably comprise a higher proportion of the plankton at midwater depths than in shallow waters dominated by crustacean zooplankters. The food sources for deep-sea larvae remain largely unresolved. In preliminary studies, bathyal echinoderm larvae reared in natural water from below the deep chlorophyll maximum consumed significant numbers of cyanobacteria, organisms so small that they should not easily sink into those depths. The implication is that these deep-sea larvae may swim actively up to shallower depths for the purpose of feeding. In this project, the investigators will examine the vertical distributions of larval forms and their potential microbial food sources in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas, focusing especially on the potential role of cyanobacteria, picoeukaryotes, and heterotrophic bacteria as food sources for migrating deep-sea larvae. A multidisciplinary team will measure larval metabolism, swimming and feeding activity; and the physiological status of potential food organisms in deep water. Empirical data will be incorporated into an energetics model that predicts the likelihood of ontogenetic migration to the euphotic zone for larvae originating at bathyal depths. In keeping with their past record outreach and education at both the college and k-12 levels, the investigators will provide extensive and intensive learning opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in hands-on multidisciplinary research. A college course, Biology of the Deep-sea Benthos, will be taught at sea, as it has been during previous NSF sponsored projects. Cruises will have internet components that will engender excitement in the adventure of science through web postings directly from the cruises.

Since early 1995,<br/>two large magnitude earthquakes (M=8.0 and M=7.6) have ruptured the Middle<br/>America subduction interface directly offshore from a 30-station GPS network,<br/>most recently in January of 2003.

Specific goals for<br/>the proposed project are as follows: (1) Continue annual measurements of the<br/>regional velocity field to characterize spatial variations in viscoelastic<br/>flow and afterslip triggered by the Mw=8.0 Oct. 9, 1995 Colima-Jalisco and<br/>M_w=7.6, 1.22.2003 Tecoman earthquakes, (2) Construct a six-station continuous<br/>GPS network to better characterize the temporal evolution of these viscoelastic<br/>and afterslip responses and better separate them from the underlying linear<br/>elastic strain accumulation. Continuous measurements will enable determine of<br/>whether the Cocos/Rivera subduction interfaces accommodate downdip transient<br/>aseismic slip events similar to those recently described for Cascadia, Japan,<br/>and southern Mexico. (3) Complete modeling of the coseismic and post-seismic<br/>effects of the 2003 Tecoman earthquake using existing and new observations,<br/>including a joint inversion of the geodetic and seismic constraints,<br/>collaborative analysis of local seismic data for aftershock relocations, and<br/>sensitivity analysis for our assumed elastic constants, layer thickness,<br/>and subduction interface geometry. (4) Employ measured variations in<br/>the direction and magnitude of interseismic strain accumulation to<br/>both estimate the degree of locking along the Rivera and Cocos plate<br/>subduction interfaces and relate onshore strain accumulation to<br/>the oceanic plate motion. (5) Determine how the 1995 Colima-Jalisco earthquake<br/>and subsequent processes altered stress levels in the adjacent Tecoman earthquake<br/>rupture zone. (6) Extract information about upper plate deformation associated<br/>with the continental rifts in our field area from GPS, seismic, and Shuttle<br/>Radar Topographic Mission data. As has been the case in previous stages of<br/>this project, the present phase of the project will have numerous broader impacts.<br/>Three Mexican scientists will participate as official collaborators: Osvaldo Sanchez<br/>of UNAM, Bertha Marquez of the Universidad de Guadalajara, and Gabriel Reyes of<br/>the University of Colima, as well as Mexican undergraduate and graduate students<br/>from three universities. In addition, support is requested for a UW graduate student<br/>to continue his finite element modeling of the geodetic data for his dissertation,<br/>a Caltech graduate student who will work with Gabriel Reyes on local seismic data,<br/>and two REU undergraduates who will work under Stock's guidance.

Magnetic and electromagnetic field sensors could be developed at a variety of near-infrared wavelengths including the 800 nm, 1310 nm and 1550 nm bands. These sensors can be made much less expensively, in much smaller sizes and with much less weight than current technologies such as current transformers. They have a potential for immediate impact in reliability of electric power distribution through failure anticipation and prevention and conservation of electric power through monitoring and control. Planar materials have much higher switching speeds than conventional perpendicular Faraday rotators and as such would permit a magnetooptical approach to packet switching. Such films are an innovative solution to device problems that require high-speed, continuously-varying polarization rotation with applied field. The project will work on improving properties and performance of such thick planar films and incorporate them into devices. Specific materials tasks are directed to improving sensitivity, linearity and temperature range of operation.<br/><br/>If successful these sensors will have applications such as wheel and turbine rotation, electric power distribution, monitoring, metering and control, and battlefield sensors. The electric power application in particular has potential to revolutionize catastrophic failure prevention in the power grid and reduce power costs at a variety of levels by enabling autonomous reconfiguration. The lack of electrical connectors in fiber optic sensors for explosive, flammable and high-voltage environments represent a significant improvement in safety. New photonic devices not currently realizable will be enabled for telecommunications and military applications such as variable optical attenuators, polarization controllers and increased speed magnetooptic switches. Photonic devices include polarization controllers, variable optical attenuators, switches and new innovative devices.

Led by Dr. Ed Houde, it builds on extensive results of the Bio-physical Interactions in the Turbidity Maximum (BITMAX) program in the Chesapeake Bay. ETMs are physical features located at the heads of coastal plain estuaries near the freshwater/saltwater interface. They trap sediment, detritus, zooplankton and fish early-life stages, enhance secondary production, and exercise control over recruitments of anadromous fish. <br/><br/>The BITMAX project substantially advanced fundamental knowledge of ETM structure and dynamics, but also identified critical gaps in understanding processes and mechanisms that are addressed in this proposal. The new research objectives are to define and evaluate processes and mechanisms promoting secondary production in ETMs. In BITMAX, the ETM was identified as a region of dynamic stability where restoring forces, both physical and biological, modulate the ETM ecosystem and periodically enhance trophic transfer. It is proposed that mechanisms promoting dynamic stability in ETMs are strongly associated with particle transformations and water column stratification that lead to predictable particle delivery, entrapment, nutritional enrichment, and trophic transfer from microbes to zooplankton to fish. <br/><br/>The research will address four hypotheses: 1) particle aggregation promotes formation and retention of nutritious particles in the ETM, 2) particle attached bacteria enrich the nutritional value of food for copepods, transforming the microbial loop into a microbial shunt, 3) abundant food and stable stratification enhance the feeding conditions and production of copepods and fish larvae, and 4) life-history strategies of key ETM species are adapted to take advantage of event-scale changes (pulses) in ETM circulation patterns. The integrated research program will be conducted through comprehensive and coordinated field, laboratory, and numerical modeling experiments in the ETM region of upper Chesapeake Bay. <br/><br/>The proposed research will expand knowledge of estuarine processes in physical and biological disciplines. Results will advance knowledge of estuarine physical oceanography and sediment transport by improving understanding of stratified tidal turbulence, particle aggregation dynamics in eutrophic environments, and ETM particle trapping. ETMs are highly productive regions in coastal-plain estuaries throughout the world. They serve as critical nursery areas for economically important fishes. Competing human interests impact physical and/or biological characteristics of the ETM via freshwater diversion, dam construction, excessive nutrient loading, channel dredging, and fisheries harvests. <br/><br/>This project has strong education and outreach components. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in field, lab and modeling techniques in a multidisciplinary research program. A teacher Fellow will gain experience working with scientists and translating research results into lesson plans. In addition to directly fostering scientific careers of students, research results will be disseminated through frequent interactions with resource managers in the Chesapeake Bay Program to ensure that societal benefits are communicated effectively."

It benefits from the growing amount of knowledge about networks to analyze the role of long-range effective interactions in the collective behavior of systems which are characteristic of those encountered in the environment. Regardless of their complexity, many physical and biological systems can be described as a set of elements with an internal dynamics (that specifies how each element will evolve under interactions) coupled to an external one (that determines which elements interact). The network approach developed in this project consists in replacing the external dynamics by a network of effective interactions that captures the long-range effects that emerge from changing local contributions. The simpler problem of describing the internal dynamics of elements interacting through network links (with, for example, small-world or scale-free architectures) can then be solved analytically or numerically. In cases where the external dynamics can be averaged, these solutions approximate the collective behavior of the original system. The project is divided into three complementary parts: (1) study of phase transitions in a set of simple dynamical processes on networks, (2) application of the network approach to a system of self-driven agents, and (3) exploration of other complex systems using the network approach.<br/><br/>In its first part, the project seeks to understand the collective changes of state that can occur in systems with elements coupled through network connections. Its results can lead to the development of efficient algorithms for distributed computations or the control of critical overloads in vital systems such as the Internet or the electric power grid. In the second part, the investigator will continue an effort to relate models of multiple moving self-driven agents to dynamics on fixed networks. This will be used as a test case for the network approach. These models can describe various complex systems such as groups of biological agents (bacteria, insects, etc.) or of autonomous robots performing collective tasks. They could lead to a better understanding or control of collective behaviors that affect the environment, such as swarms of locusts or fish. They could also help develop algorithms for simple robots to work together in robust and scalable ways, performing tasks ranging from containing a disease to deploying for security, surveillance or rescue purposes. The third part of this project will search for additional applications of the network approach by identifying other biotic or abiotic complex systems that can be analyzed through this common perspective. The approach will be tested in various systems with high economic and environmental impact such as granular materials (where force chains can be represented as direct links to study avalanches), epidemics and ecosystems (where links describing effective interactions between organisms can be extracted from empirical data). Finally, the project will strengthen research interactions by involving collaborations with scientists of different disciplines and institutions in the United States and Latin America."

Research over the past decade has shown that spatial heterogeneity can influence coevolutionary interactions. However, a complete, mechanistic understanding of the influence of spatial heterogeneity on coevolution is still needed. <br/>The proposed research combines theoretical and empirical approaches to rigorously evaluate how spatial heterogeneity in resource availability and dispersal among habitat patches influence coevolution. It utilizes the bacterium Escherichia coli and the bacteriophage T7, a viral parasitoid of E. coli, as model coevolving organisms. Experiments in which dispersal and resource availability are directly manipulated will be combined with theoretical models that incorporate details of the host-parasitoid interaction to provide both qualitative and quantitative predictions of how dispersal across a heterogeneous landscape influences coevolution. This research provides a crucial middle ground between the relative simplicity of current mathematical models and the complexity of field studies. This research will add to our understanding of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution and metacommunity theory, which underlie much of the work on habitat fragmentation in conservation biology. This work will also increase our understanding of coevolving microbes, which perform many crucial ecosystem services and which have been vastly understudied. Finally, the research will contribute to our general knowledge of how spatial heterogeneity influences the ecology and evolution of interacting organisms."

Seed, University of California, Berkeley<br/>""SGER: Hurricane Katrina and Lessons for Responding and Repairing Catastrophic Levee Failures Applicable to Other Similarly Threatened Areas in the U.S.""<br/><br/> The potential for hurricane-induced catastrophic failure of the levees and subsequent flooding of New Orleans had long been foreseen by technical experts. However, New Orleans is not the only region in the United States in which this type of catastrophic hazard exists, but goes largely unaddressed. A stunningly similar situation exists in California with regard to potentially catastrophic seismic risk associated with the fragile labyrinth of levees that pass two-thirds of California's vital fresh water safely through the key node in the State's extensive water distribution system. The city of Sacramento is currently the largest metropolitan area with the lowest level of levee flood protection in North America. Additional critical levee systems provide flood protection throughout the Mississippi and Ohio River basins, as well as in the Charleston area, and in other regions of the U.S.<br/><br/>There are key lessons of vital importance to be learned from the performance of the New Orleans levee systems, and the emergency repair and pumping to dewater the inundated areas. Although there is considerable experience in the emergency repair of isolated breaks, the New Orleans disaster represents an unprecedented instance in which military assets were made available for assisting in emergency repairs. This event provides the first opportunity to quantitatively assess the value and impact of such operations as opposed to more traditional use of barges to dump rock and dredged fill, or land-borne transport and equipment to carry and place new fill soils. The degree of scour erosion at the various levees breaks will be investigated and compared to placement rates of oversized helicopter-borne ""sand bags."" The team will investigate issues related to contracting and difficulties in the field placement of material. Additional elements include the seepage as well as settlement and subsidence of the emergency repaired sections. Long term performance of the hurried repairs is an important element of the problem, as is the degree to which permanent repairs will be affected by the presence of the unorthodox emergency levee ""patches."" Other issues that will be investigated include the degree to which wind driven waves eroded the back faces of the flooded levees, the degree of erosion and damage caused in non-breached levee sections due to partial and wave-driven overtopping, and the levee configurations and crest and upper face protection details, and their interaction with surge-driven water levels and wind-driven waves. Another set of issues that will be studied are the levee designs and configurations, and their overall performances in this event. Many critical levees did not fail, and these represent important lessons as well. The design basis and decision process that led to the current levee configurations are also key elements that will be investigated.<br/><br/>It is vital to absorb these lessons from the engineers and personnel who performed and oversaw the repairs, and that these lessons be effectively transmitted to levee repair experts, emergency planners, and risk assessment experts in other regions. These lessons can improve speed and efficiency and thus are invaluable in planning the response to large (catastrophic) emergencies. The interdisciplinary team benefits from the synergistic efforts and/or funding from the American Society of Civil Engineers and the California Department of Water Resources. The team members are diverse and include nationally recognized levee experts and outstanding experience in the field of natural disasters. The investigation of the performance of the New Orleans area levees in the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina will provide vital information for the future performance of critical protective levee systems throughout large areas of the U.S."

A facility for performing vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy will be developed including the following objectives:  1) development of a picosecond laser pulse wavelength extension into mid-infrared range; 2) construction of a spectrometer; and 3) integration of the new instrument with a time-correlated fluorescence spectrometer.  The facility will allow the spatial dependency, time dependency, and chemical dependency of molecular structures to be determined.  Special investigations of the interface between a substrate and a bulk phase will be possible with the new spectrometer, which will be highly valuable in developing a more fundamental understanding of film fabrication, curing, and adhesion.  Both the interactions of molecular functionalities at interfaces and the mechanisms through which interface dynamics influence these interactions will be investigated.  Polymeric films used for coatings and nanoparticles will be important emphases in the research.<br/><br/> The new facility will provide new educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from physics, electrical engineering, analytical chemistry, and other disciplines.  Interdisciplinary research efforts will be strongly enhanced.  Programs are in place that provide special opportunities for women and Native American students.  An effective REU program has been established.  The instrument will become a regional facility which will be utilized by a number of institutions that are strongly interested in having this advanced capability.  <br/>"

The key factor inhibiting deeper understanding of theoretical advances concerning the nature and effects of HRPs is the extraordinary difficulty in obtaining appropriate data. By generating the right data and applying appropriate econometric methods, this project will contribute important findings and new data of interest to many researchers including economists in the fields of insider econometrics and personnel economics. By using large and rich data sets both for workers who remained in as well as those who left the firm during the study period, this project is able to employ unusual controls and to use appropriate econometric methods to deal with problems that often plague empirical work in this area, such as selectivity issues. Furthermore, in some instances, this project's approach may best be characterized as representing a quasi experiment. Having access to census data in some countries will enable the investigators to generalize their findings. <br/><br/>Already senior management in 10 firms in the U.S., Finland and China are providing the investigators with three types of extraordinary micro-data. Performance data sets usually include daily or weekly performance measures for individual workers and key organizational units (e.g. teams), cover extended periods (more than 3 years), contain multiple measures of performance (including productivity and quality), span the times both before and after major organizational innovations (such as the introduction of teams) and include all employees of the firm during the study period. Personnel data sets contain detailed individual employee records, including longitudinal disaggregated information by type of compensation. Employee survey data sets provide supplementary information both on employees' participation in HRPs and attitudinal and perceptual measures that are constructed to gauge both employee outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction and intensity of effort) and theoretical concepts, including proxies for the extent of peer pressure, discretionary effort, the extent of attention to quality, and communications. Most unusually, in some cases employee surveys will be panels-having been administered more than once to the same employees and for a period both before and after all employees were covered by a particular HRP.<br/><br/>In a series of ""econometric case studies"" these matching data will be used to test hypotheses on four sets of issues concerning the nature, determinants and effects of HRPs. The key focus is on the impact of different HRPs on business performance---especially high performance workplace practices (HPWPs, e.g. employee ownership, teams and profit sharing). Competing hypotheses on whether individual HPWPs improve levels and variability of enterprise performance and whether sets of HPWPs produce improvements in enterprise performance that exceed the effect of individual organizational changes are examined. The second set of hypotheses concern competing hypotheses as to whether individual HRPs improve employee outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction and work intensity) and whether sets of HRPs are associated with changes in employee outcomes that exceed the effect of individual organizational changes. The third set of hypotheses concern the actual channels through which firm and employee outcomes might be affected by the introduction of HRPs. Thus, financial participation (e.g. profit sharing) may lead employees to increase their co-workers performance either by enhanced peer pressure or through greater trust leading to improved cooperation. These influences may work in different directions. Also our data enable this project to study the incidence of certain HRPs within firms (e.g. what accounts for differences in individual shareholdings in firms that have employee ownership?) Finally, in all three areas the project will investigate hypotheses that exploit the uniform nature of data for cases located in very different environments. Thus the project provides evidence on hypotheses concerning predicted differences in the size of both firm and employee outcomes in differing institutional environments (such as the U.S. compared to Finland or China).<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Since HRPs are assuming increasing importance, the project findings are apt to have broad implications for organizational design. Particularly novel will be evidence on offline teams and individual ownership, for outcomes including product quality and matching evidence on employee outcomes. Comparative evidence will provide useful insights concerning the potentially varying impact of HRPs across countries and sectors and hence indications as to how transferable HRPs are across diverse nations. These insights are particularly useful since the number of foreign transplants in China and other transition economies is expected to continue to rise. Finally, theoretical work concerning the nature and effects of organizational innovations is likely to benefit from our subjecting diverse hypotheses to rigorous empirical scrutiny."

In particular, the role of tropical forest ""refuges"", river barriers and ecological gradients in promoting speciation has been the subject of much recent debate. This study will use a molecular approach to test for these potential mechanisms of diversification by comparing spatial patterns of genetic variation in a suite of forest antelope species. Data from this study will then be used to test predicted patterns of genetic variation associated with these different diversification modes and examine their relative importance. In order to achieve the intense geographical sampling required for this study, this project will use dung from natural populations as a source of DNA. <br/><br/>The implementation of such a project relies heavily on the participation of collaborating host institutions comprising the Centre International de Recherches Medicales in Franceville, Gabon (CIRMF), the Universite des Sciences et Techniques de Masuku in Gabon (USTM) and the Gabon Program of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), a conservation NGO based in New York. Through this collaboration, this project will stimulate exchange of expertise between African and U.S. participants and provide opportunities for technology transfer between countries. This study will not only provide important information on the potential mechanisms of diversification in the Afro-tropics but will also provide a molecular inventory of species distributions and solid genetic database for informing long-term conservation management of central African forest antelope.

The Raindrop framework incorporates additional advanced features, such as schema-based optimization, multiple execution modes and run-time physical plan reformulation. <br/><br/>A long-reaching impact is expected in many real-world applications that are Internet centric, as these can benefit from the resulting XML-based stream monitoring technology.

This focus on overlay functionality has left unanswered the single most critical question: What lies underneath?

First, there must be some means of information discovery and dissemination through with overlays learn about the underlying Internet; a so-called Information Plane. Second, elevating overlays to first-class objects places special emphasis on the coordinated assignment of complex collections of network resources (e.g., bandwidth, storage, computational cycles, shared information) to competing overlays in an economically coherent, computationally practical fashion. This requires an Economic Framework for resource allocation. Third, there is a complementary question of how to define the basic unit of resource, and the challenges in the implementation of decisions made in resource allocation by means of Virtualization. Combined, these elements form the critical core of an operating environment for overlays; the necessary universal substructure for an overlay-enabled world.

This research continues an ongoing effort to develop, calibrate, test, and deploy in situ electrochemical sensors for pH, temperature, and important Hydrogen and sulfur-bearing redox compounds, with the goal of producing an instrument package that can be used for long term monitoring of hydrothermal vent chemistry at mid-ocean ridges. Prototype testing of the instrument has been successful and measured, in real time, the in situ pH and H2 and H2S concentrations of waters emanating from high and low temperature, diffuse-flow vents. This work will extend the monitoring capabilities of the sensor array and increase its physical robustness for long-term deployment on the seafloor. Field test sites will be high temperature and low temperature diffuse flow vents on the East Pacific Rise and low temperature vents at Lost City or the Rainbow site on the Mid Atlantic Ridge. Long-term lab testing of the material properties of the sensors will be carried out for the solid-state pH sensor and results will be disseminated widely to build a user base. Specific project goals include in-situ computer controlled calibration of the present high temperature sensor package and the development of a solid-state pH sensor, which is better suited for long-term use in high pH and biologically active hydrothermal vent areas. The first year of the program will be devoted to technical upgrades of the present chemical sensor system. Field deployments and testing of the sensor packages will take place in years two and three at the EPR 9N and MAR hydrothermal sites using submersibles and/or ROVs.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This work funds researchers and students at the University of Minnesota. Broader impacts consist of new sensor/tool development and application of the tools in environments previously too hostile, in terms of temperature, pressure, corrosive chemistry and/or biofouling, to be sampled and measured in-situ. As such, this work enhances research infrastructure available to the ocean sciences community, especially with regard to making crucial time series measurements of inherently dynamical processes linked to energy and mass transfer at mid-ocean ridges."

The sensors will be based on CdSe nanoparticles of known fluorescence properties to which proteins with known, highly specific affinities for small molecules have been linked chemically. Presence of the protein on the nanoparticle will reduce (quench) the strong fluorescence normally exhibited by such particles. The binding of the small molecule of interest is expected to alter protein structure and result in the reduction or elimination of the quenching of the fluorescence. The planned studies are aimed at development of sensors for maltose, based on the maltose binding protein found in the periplasmic space of gram-negative bacteria, and for arsenite/antimonite and Pb2+/Cd2+, based on two members of a family of metal ion binding transcription factors (ArsR and CadC, respectively). These novel sensors will belong to a class of nanobiosensors usually termed reagentless nanobiosensors because they do not require reagents other than the sensor itself. In the past, such single component sensors have employed oligonucleotides to provide specificity needed for the detection of the molecule of interest. However, use of oligonucleotides limits the range of target molecules that can be detected. Existing protein-based sensors, which have a potentially larger range, require multiple components, which complicates their use. In addition to the potential utility of such reagentless nanobiosensors, the project will provide research training for graduate students, and will provide the basis for new activities in a summer program for students in the Detroit public schools."

Neutrino transport and dynamics is important in understanding supernova explosions as well as the behavior of accretion discs which surround black wholes. This proposal looks at how neutrinos behave when they are interacting in the presence of a dense media. The PI proposes to investigate two main topics: (i) the physics of neutrino flavor evolution in dense neutrino systems and (ii) the physics of neutrino transport in accretion disks around black holes. The PI has discovered the importance of flavor exchange forward scattering processes in the presence of correlations of velocity and flavor distribution which can significantly speed up flavor exchange in supernova simulations. The PI intends to calculate the effects his new ideas about the physics of neutrino scattering on supernova theory. The PI will also investigate how neutrino physics affects hyper accreting disks in situations where Black wholes are gobbling up remnants of stars.

For organizations such as the military, government, and multinational corporations, this can be an enormous risk. Anonymous communications is a technology that can stop this kind of information leakage by mixing different traffic together as it goes through the Internet. Current systems, however, are vulnerable to long-term passive attacks, in which eavesdroppers or malicious operators can uncover the traffic patterns.<br/><br/>This exploratory research will examine potential solutions to these attacks. It will use in-depth simulations to explore defenses against timing analysis, by which the attacker uses the timings of messages to trace a user's traffic through the network. Attacks on longer-term traffic patterns will be combatted in two ways, both of which will be evaluated with analysis and simulation. First, ideas from peer-to-peer file-sharing systems will be used to secure the process of selecting nodes. Second, artificially-generated traffic based on other users' patterns will make it more difficult to single users out. Additionally, a testbed for exploring these ideas through experimentation will be constructed. The work will be at the forefront of creating a new, more secure generation of anonymous communications systems."

Approximately 50% of prospective engineers are weeded out in large lecture courses their very first year in college (Seymour and Hewett, 1997). Students appear to be leaving because they are not engaged in the content. One way to address this problem is to develop and implement technology-based teaching environments that are more engaging and motivating to students, either as a substitute for, or adjunct to, lecture-based instruction. Video games hold promise in this regard because they are inherently engaging and have the potential to be effective teaching tools. <br/><br/>Despite the growing popularity of the notion that video games can be used to teach science content, the idea has been subject to little (if any) scientific scrutiny. Hence, we seek in this project to examine the pedagogy that underlies educational games, and begin rigorous testing of a particular gaming format that appears to be promising. Specifically, our purpose is to examine the effectiveness of a massively multiplayer game for teaching college freshman physics concepts. Our main hypothesis is that an engaging multiplayer game can serve as an effective adjunct to traditional teaching methods, resulting in improved learning of targeted materials and enhanced motivation to remain in science and engineering. In addition, we will manipulate various features of the game design itself to determine whether (and how) several theoretically derived propositions about learning apply in this environment.<br/><br/>The project will extend a commercial-grade multiplayer physics game that has already been under development for three years, and use it to teach introductory physics concepts to college students. We expect that a game-based approach to physics instruction will result in students learning more physics content, retaining more physics content, becoming more motivated to learn and showing better inclination to study science and engineering. These hypotheses will be tested by experiments conducted in introductory physics classes at the University of Central Florida and through releasing six versions of the game to the public and tracking game play."

Recent research shows that Hg(II) binds to DOM more strongly (KDOM 1023 L kg-1) than previously thought under environmentally relevant conditions. Strong binding of mercury by DOM, which is controlled by a small fraction of the DOM containing reactive thiol functional groups, is second only to sulfide when compared to other ligands of geochemical significance. In addition to strong binding of Hg(II) by thiol-like moieties associated with DOM, strong DOM-Hg interactions are apparent from studies of the effects of DOM on the dissolution and precipitation of relatively-insoluble cinnabar (HgS). Organic matter enhances HgS dissolution through surface reactions favored by DOM rich in aromatic moieties. Precipitation of metacinnabar (HgS) is inhibited by low concentrations (=3 mg C L-1) of DOM by prevention of the aggregation of nanocolloidal mercuric sulfide. Interactions of HgS with DOM can influence the geochemistry and bioavailability of Hg in aquatic environments by maintaining higher dissolved total Hg concentrations than predicted by current speciation models.<br/>In this proposal, Joe Ryan (University of Colorado at Boulder), Kathryn Nagy (University of Illinois at Chicago), and George Aiken (U.S. Geological Survey, Boulder, Colorado) outline a plan to investigate more challenging aspects of Hg-organic matter interactions. Similar interactions with selected metals (from soft to hard) will be studied. Better definition of these interactions is required for the improvement of metal speciation models and increased understanding of the factors controlling metal cycling in aquatic systems. Specific objectives of this research are to (1) quantify the effects of organic matter, metal nature, and sulfide concentration on metal binding by dissolved and solid organic matter at environmentally relevant concentrations, (2) elucidate the contributions to metal binding by sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen functional groups in organic matter, (3) examine the effect of organic matter nature on the inhibition of metal sulfide precipitation, with an emphasis on mercuric sulfide, and (4) probe the mechanism of DOM enhancement of metal-sulfide dissolution. Major products of this research will be the determination of organic matter binding constants for selected toxic metals at environmentally relevant concentrations and the assessment of colloidal stabilization as a process contributing to the occurrence of dissolved metals in aquatic systems.<br/>Broader impacts of the proposed research include dissemination of the research results at national conferences and in peer-reviewed journals in addition to the following special activities. The co-PIs and their research assistants will collaborate with Dr. Edward Tipping, developer of a widely used geochemical equilibrium model (WHAM), to incorporate new DOM-metal binding constants into metal speciation calculations and with Dr. Alain Manceau to characterize competitive binding of metals with organic matter used in bioremediation schemes. The co-PIs will develop a graduate class on the interactions of organic matter with contaminants. The information resulting from this study will be directly applicable to the effective management of aquatic ecosystems, and has important implications for ecosystem restoration programs. Dr. Aiken will continue to participate in U.S. Geological Survey efforts to make science accessible for environmental regulators managing the Florida Everglades and the San Joaquin-Sacramento River delta in California."

That infrastructure will not be complete until two important criteria are satisfied: (1) Researchers must have access to a null-mutant of every gene in the genome. (2) Tools must be created that allow tandemly-duplicated genes to be knocked-out. In order to satisfy these needs, a reverse-genetic resource consisting of a collection of mapped T-DNA lines that contain Ds transposon launch-pads and Cre/Lox recombination sites will be developed. These functional elements will give users the ability to create targeted deletions of any segment of the genome, be it a group of tandemly-duplicated genes or a single gene for which no mutant allele currently exists. Through previous efforts, 10,450 of these pDs-Lox T-DNA lines were delivered to the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University. The goal of the present project is to deliver an additional 50,000 mapped pDs-Lox T-DNA lines to the Arabidopsis community over the course of the next two years. Details regarding the production and availability of these lines can be found at the following web site: www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis. This project will help the Arabidopsis community achieve the goals of the 2010 project by providing scientists with access to null mutants for genes and groups of genes that would otherwise not be available.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This community resource will provide scientists with the tools that they need to generate targeted deletions throughout the Arabidopsis genome. In order to ensure that this technology is accessible to the broadest range of researchers, a comprehensive, web-based tutorial will be developed to accompany this new collection of mapped pDs-Lox lines. This tutorial will provide users with both theoretical and practical information relating to the uses of the pDs-Lox population. Detailed lab protocols will be developed that guide users through the following processes: (1) performing genetic crosses; (2) mobilizing a Ds element and screening for re-insertions; (3) performing Cre/Lox recombination and screening for the desired deletion. The availability of these tailor-made protocols will give labs with no prior transposon experience the information that they need to benefit from the pDs-Lox system. This web-based tutorial will be developed by undergraduate students, thereby providing an opportunity for undergraduates to gain valuable experience working as part of a research team."

Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity Act twice, and it went into effect in November 1997. Since then, over 170 people have made use of the law to end their lives. A 2005-2006 Supreme Court case, Gonzales v. Oregon, appeals lower court decisions to uphold the Oregon law and poses the question of who should decide the question of physician-assisted suicide: the attorney general, pursuant to a national standard of the use of controlled substances, or each of the 50 states. Therefore, this case has considerable potential to galvanize and divide public opinion irrespective of how the Court decides. Although considerable social psychological research suggests that people will accept the Court decision because they generally perceive the procedures of the Supreme Court to be fair, recent research indicates that people care very little about due process when they have a moral mandate about the outcome of the case -- that is, a strong attitude held with equally strong moral conviction about physician-assisted suicide. Recent research suggests that when people have a moral mandate, even fair procedures do not appease the sense of outrage that people experience when their morally mandated outcome is not achieved. This study conducts a survey using a longitudinal panel design with a national representative sample as well as an over-sample of participants from the State of Oregon to further explore the extent to which moral mandates drive people's justice reasoning in some contexts. This research will allow us to (a) further explore how moral mandates differ from otherwise strong, but non-moral attitudes, (b) gain an increased understanding of why they differ from otherwise strong, but non-moral attitudes, (c) shed new light on the factors that shape both specific and diffuse perceptions of institutional legitimacy, and (d) explore the consequences of Supreme Court decisions that either affirm or challenge people's moral convictions, including their subsequent willingness to obey both related and unrelated laws."

The PI's initial results are startling in that the inclusions in these diamonds are strongly magnetic and, perhaps more surprising, that they are stably magnetized. The researchers hope to test the hypothesis that these magnetizations are carried by pyrrhotite. Pyrrhotite exhibits a number of diagnostic magnetic properties that vary with temperature. In addition to standard rock magnetic measurements that will be carried out in the FIU paleomagnetism laboratory, we will conduct hysteresis and temperature-dependent measurements at the Institute for Rock Magnetism at the University of Minnesota. After conducting these non-destructive measurements, the PI will polish the diamonds to expose the inclusions and examine the mineralogy using microprobe analyses. These experiments will determine whether the observed magnetizations are carried by pyrrhotite or by other iron/nickel sulfides. Identifying the mineral(s) responsible for the strong magnetizations of these<br/>inclusions may open up exciting possibilities for using diamonds to obtain paleointensity data from critical intervals of Earth history, and for the study of the magnetic properties of these minerals at the high pressures within diamonds.The paleomanetism program at Florida International University has consistently involved both undergraduate and graduate students in its ongoing research programs.

The requested funds would be highly leveraged because most of the cost of drilling a 5km deep borehole will be borne by industry and the Icelandic government, with participation from the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program. An Icelandic geothermal power company is providing an existing ~ 3 km deep well for deepening to 5 km depth. This project will provide the first opportunity worldwide to investigate the deep, high temperature reaction zone of a mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal system, which has been a long-standing goal of the Ocean Drilling Program. This drill site is ideally situated for a broad array of scientific studies involving reactions between basalt and seawater at high temperatures, reaching supercritical conditions. Such active processes in the deep, high temperature reaction zones that control fluid compositions of black smokers have never before been available for comprehensive direct study and sampling. Ocean drilling has penetrated only 2 km into 5 Ma old ocean crust. where temperatures were ~ 180 oC. In contrast, the IDDP collaboration with industry in Iceland will produce fluid samples from the flow tests at 3, 4, and 5 km, drill cuttings and spot cores down to 4.0 km depth, and 1.0 km of continuous drill core from 4.0 to 5.0 km depth. These samples will reveal the integrated record of basalt-seawater interactions at >400oC.

Multiple mechanisms controlling OM burial in sediments have been proposed and the scientific discussion is controversial. One proposed mechanism is that formation of small, highly-reactive, oxygen-containing species, such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, may be important in degradation of sorbed OM under oxic conditions. No studies have shown the presence of reactive oxygen species in sediments, but theoretical arguments suggest that the abiotic formation of hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide and Fe2+ through the Fenton reaction may be substantial in coastal sediments.<br/><br/>In this project, researchers at the University of Connecticut will address the following hypotheses by studying the occurrence of hydroxyl radicals in sediment with and without seasonal anoxia (two geographical locations): 1. Hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide are formed in abiotic reactions affected by sediment redox conditions. 2. Hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide have substantial formation rates in coastal sediments and the formation rates and steady-sate concentrations vary with season. 3. Hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide can be formed in microbially-mediated reactions and the formation rates and steady-sate concentrations depend on redox conditions, season, and hydrogen-peroxide-removing enzyme activity. Four different methods for quantification of hydroxyl radical formation rates will be evaluated to arrive at the best method to use in the heterogeneous sediment environment. <br/><br/>This project has a number of educational broader impacts.

The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of the neural basis of this remarkable feat has been greatly advanced by the discovery of a cortical area that responds well to intact objects but not to scrambled versions of these same images. This region, termed ""the lateral occipital complex"" (LOC), runs ventrally from the occipital lobe to the posterior regions of the temporal lobe. LOC is not merely activated by familiar objects in that unfamiliar objects, such as abstract sculptures, also produced greater activation in LOC compared to their scrambled versions. Nor is activation in LOC merely a feed forward effect from earlier visual stages in that these stages show greater activation for the scrambled compared to the intact versions of the images. LOC responds equivalently to a photograph and a line drawing of the same object. Bilateral lesions to LOC have been shown to produce a complete inability to recognize objects on the basis of their shape, while leaving visually guided motor interactions unaffected. LOC thus represents physical shape to which, presumably, semantic information, including a name, can be associated. This stage thus appears to be at the threshold of cognition. Despite the advances enabled by the LOC localizer, there is considerable uncertainty as what this localizer is actually localizing. The scrambling operation affects both low-level measures of the image as well as higher-level aspects associated with the interpretation of the object. The low-level measures include an increase in the extent of the display produced by the scattering of the elements, a loss of low frequency information, and a marked increase in the clumps from one (the intact object) to over 20. Of course, with the scattering, the sizes of the clumps are similarly reduced. With National Science Foundation funding, Dr. Irving Biederman will conduct fMRI research designed to clarify just what the localizer is localizing and in doing so, provide some clues as to how shape is abstracted from an image. The research would elucidate the neural coding of object vs. texture, the effect of the number of elements in a display and whether these elements comprise an intact object or scene. Additionally, attention will be paid toward defining those cortical areas that might be more responsive to aspects, such as texture rather than object, in the scrambled images.<br/><br/>The immediate broader impacts will be to contribute to advancing our knowledge as to the neural representation of shape for purposes of recognition. The research will fill a critical gap between psychophysical (behavioral) research on object recognition and single-unit recording of shape variations in the macaque. Although the homologues between human and macaque of primary sensory and motor cortices are well established there are significant questions concerning the homologues of later, perceptual ""association"" areas. Extensive plans are already in place for an outreach program involving USC's NSF-funded 3T scanner. Because of the accessibility of the problem of real-time object recognition to a non-technically advanced audience, this research will be one of the featured research projects for exposing cognitive neuroscience to students from USC's largely minority neighborhood and to recruit some to participate in the research itself."

Combined actions/loadings can have significant effects on the force and deformation capacity of reinforced concrete columns, resulting in unexpected large deformations and extensive damage that in turn influences the performance of bridges as vital components of transportation systems. These effects should be considered in earthquake analysis and design of bridges so that significant earthquake damage and severe disruption of transportation systems can be reduced. The objectives of the project are to develop a fundamental knowledge of the impact of combined actions on column performance and system response and to establish analysis and design procedures that include the impact at both the component and system levels. The objectives will be realized by integrating analytical and experimental research where physical tests are driven by analyses and simulations that examine the system response of various bridge types under different loading conditions. The analytical models are calibrated by experimental data and then extended to system response. <br/><br/>The experimental program includes quasi-static testing of twenty-four large columns (fourteen will be funded by NEES) providing fundamental behavior including the impact of torsional moments at University of Missouri, Rolla (UMR), pseudo-dynamic testing of three large and four small scale columns with variable axial load, within a bridge system simulation, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), real-time dynamic testing of eight large scale columns with bidirectional, torsional and variable axial load inputs at University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), four tests provided by the University of Mexico (UNAM), plus an integrated experiment with three columns linked through simulation, conducted at UIUC by UMR. Fragility analysis will be undertaken, leading to the derivation of probabilistically-based fragility relationships for bridges subjected to combined action. Simplified analysis and design tools will be developed as well as the necessary code language to change the existing practice. Design and analysis methods will be derived that will affect the earthquake design practice in the US and internationally. Coordination of an integrated test program has already begun between the US and Japanese researchers. Analysis components will be done at UCLA, UIUC, UMR and UNR.<br/><br/> An integrated education, training and outreach program, lead by Washington University, will span from 4th graders to practicing engineers. Modules will be developed for teachers and professors that can be inserted in their courses. Modules will be used by the research team in summer camps, visits to local elementary, middle and high schools, undergraduate and graduate courses and in continuing education courses. Specific programs are targeted towards underrepresented groups. To achieve its objectives, the project will utilize the NEESit cyber-infrastructure, state-of-the-art instrumentation and high-speed data acquisition systems, the NEES equipment sites at UNR and UIUC and the non-NEES site at UMR, which has committed to joining NEESgrid."
0526978	Collaborative Research: Estimation and Assessment of Errors in High-Frequency Radar Ocean Current Measurements	OCE	PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	10/01/2005	09/18/2005	Kenneth Laws	CA	University of California-Santa Cruz	Standard Grant	Eric C. Itsweire	09/30/2007	"$170,466.00"	John Vesecky	kip@soe.ucsc.edu	1156 High Street	Santa Cruz	CA	950641077	8314595278	GEO	1610	"0000, OTHR"	$0.00	"0526978<br/><br/>This is a proposal to conduct a simulation-based analysis of errors in high frequency (HF) radar derived ocean surface current measurements and develop means of assessing these errors in observational systems in use today. The systematic identification and description of these errors is needed for assimilation of HF radar-derived current measurements into near-shore ocean circulation models. It is also needed for incorporation into the many new operational products that are being created based on continuous maps of ocean surface currents from HF radar networks. Conclusions will be applicable to HF radar-derived current measurements in general, but analyses will focus on systems that use compact, collocated antenna geometry and direction finding techniques, such as the CODAR/SeaSonde systems. Other commercially available systems, such as the Welan Radar or WERA, can also be operated in a direction-finding configuration. The interest in HF radar systems for near-shore mapping of ocean surface currents is presently undergoing a period of rapid acceleration. Systems are already in place at numerous locations around the coastal United States as well as many other locations around the world. These systems provide near real-time measurements of the ocean circulation within the top one or two meters of the ocean surface, on a 1-3 km resolution grid, with a range over the ocean surface of about 70 km with up to 200 km for the long range units but reliable estimates of the point-by-point uncertainties in the data remain unavailable even though such error values, together with their statistical descriptions, are required for proper assimilation into numerical circulation models. While estimates of overall uncertainty levels have been provided through comparisons with in situ measurements, those comparisons on their own are not sufficient for a number of reasons. Firstly, the in situ and remote-sensing measurements are inherently different. Current meters and, to a lesser extent, drifters measure velocity at a fixed point while the radar is sensitive to the current averaged over several square kilometers. Secondly, the radar measures the current very close to the surface where measurement with conventional current meters is problematic. Thirdly, the continuous, two-dimensional coverage of the radar cannot be duplicated and, therefore systematic errors, such as pointing biases in the direction finding algorithms, cannot be assessed based solely on comparisons with in situ observations.<br/><br/>The broad impact of effective assimilation of HF current measurements in coastal areas would be felt by the scientific, coastal engineering, public safety and recreational communities through more detailed and accurate nowcasts and forecasts for ocean circulation and wave conditions with greatly improved accuracy and resolution. For example, prediction of surface flows with high spatial and temporal resolution would enhance air-sea rescue and oil and toxic spill response by allowing accurate drift forecasts. Similarly, more accurate predictions of coastal circulation could lead to forecasting shifts in marine populations from phytoplankton to whales. This project seeks to address the problem of error analysis and assessment through the use of computer simulations backed up, where appropriate, by comparisons with existing in situ data sets. The effects of a wide variety of error sources, including ship echoes, ionospheric echoes, random noise, random variations in the ocean currents within a measurement cell, imperfect knowledge of system properties, such as antenna pattern distortion, and limitations of the direction finding algorithms as a function of antenna design will be examined. A systematic look at error propagation for the commonly used HF radar configurations is overdue and that, once documented, these error models will accelerate the exploitation of these remarkable oceanographic instruments."

The proposed work will address hypotheses regarding the<br/>biogeochemical interactions that lead to the removal of molybdenum, uranium, and<br/>vanadium from aquatic systems and the fractionation of Mo isotopes that occurs during<br/>organic matter decomposition. Our study site, Lake Tanganyika, is an ancient rift lake that<br/>has an oxygenated upper water column and sulfidic deep waters. The existence of<br/>sedimentary deposits underlying both these waters offers an exciting and timely opportunity<br/>to quantify changes in metal solubility and to test predictions regarding isotope fractionation<br/>associated with metal precipitation. Our work is guided by two hypotheses that predict a<br/>close link between metal accumulation rate and carbon cycling. These hypotheses predict<br/>different behavior for Mo isotopes depending on whether or not the overlying water has<br/>sulfide present. (1) In regions where the overlying water column is absent of sulfide, we<br/>hypothesize that trace element accumulation in the sediments and Mo isotope compositions<br/>are closely coupled to the cycling of organic carbon. (2) Where sediments are bathed with<br/>sulfide-rich water, we hypothesize that trace element enrichments remain sensitive to the<br/>organic carbon cycling but Mo isotope values are invariant. Although we use these<br/>hypotheses as a guide for our research, we do expect that the targeted elements will exhibit a<br/>range of sensitivities to organic carbon cycling and water column sulfide concentrations.<br/>Broader impacts I: Scientific value. The targeted elements already offer potential as<br/>biogeochemical tracers, and this proposal represents an exciting opportunity to address<br/>important issues regarding their environmental chemistry. Molybdenum isotopes also<br/>retain potential as a tracer for the availability of oxygen and sulfide through geologic time,<br/>and this proposal will allow us to examine how the presence of water column sulfide<br/>influences Mo isotope behavior. Finally, the African Great Lakes harbor rich records of<br/>climate history extending back to the Miocene. What we offer here is an opportunity to<br/>calibrate a suite of sedimentary tracers that could ultimately provide powerful insights on<br/>biogeochemical process, not only in Tanganyika, but in other sedimentary systems as well.<br/>Broader impacts II: Human impacts and opportunities for education. Lake<br/>Tanganyika is a valuable resource to the East African people. The lake contains a<br/>significant fraction of the Earth's fresh water and supplies the economies of several nations<br/>with a valuable fisheries resource. In a broad sense, this proposal offers tools for<br/>addressing questions related to how the lake's carbon dynamics have responded to past<br/>changes in climate. As part of this proposal, McManus will be participating in the Nyanza<br/>project during the summer of 2006. The Nyanza Project is an undergraduate/graduate field<br/>research program that offers opportunities to study paleoclimatology and geology in a<br/>continental rift cradling one of the world's oldest lakes. As a participant in the program<br/>McManus will be engaged in training both U.S. and African students, and we plan on<br/>having one African student and two U.S. students working on our field research. We will<br/>also support an OSU undergraduate during our second year of funding. Undergraduate<br/>students have contributed significantly to the PI's research program resulting in abstracts<br/>delivered at major conferences, university-wide student research programs, and coauthorship<br/>on two manuscripts. Our college is beginning to engage students from our university's<br/>honors college in research and we are planning on initiating an REU program in the near<br/>term. We anticipate having a student from one of these programs participating in the<br/>proposed research as well. Finally, this proposal will provide support for a postdoctoral<br/>research associate (Chris Siebert)."

Molted seal skin and hair occur along 300 km of coastline, more than 1000 km from any extant colony. The last record of a seal at a former colony site is at ~A.D. 1600. Because abandonment occurred prior to subantarctic sealing, disappearance of the VLC colony probably was due to environmental factors, possibly cooling and encroachment of land-fast, perennial sea ice that made access to haul-out sites difficult. The record of seal inhabitation along the VLC, therefore, has potential as a proxy for climate change. Elephant seals are a predominantly subantarctic species with circumpolar distribution. Genetic studies have revealed significant differentiation among populations, particularly with regard to that at Macquarie I., which is the extant population nearest to the abandoned VLC colony. Not only is the Macquarie population unique genetically, but it is has undergone unexplained decline of 2%/yr over the last 50 years3. In a pilot study, genetic analyses showed a close relationship between the VLC seals and those at Macquarie I. An understanding of the relationship between the two populations, as well as of the environmental pressures that led to the demise of the VLC colonies, will provide a better understanding of present-day population genetic structure, the effect of environmental change on seal populations, and possibly the reasons underlying the modern decline at Macquarie Island.<br/>This project addresses several key research problems: (1) Why did elephant seals colonize and then abandon the VLC? (2) What does the elephant seal record reveal about Holocene climate change and sea-ice conditions? (3) What were the foraging strategies of the seals and did these strategies change over time as climate varied? (4) How does the genetic structure of the VLC seals relate to extant populations? (5) How did genetic diversity change over time and with colony decline? (6) Using ancient samples to estimate mtDNA mutation rates, what can be learned about VLC population dynamics over time? (7) What was the ecological relationship between elephant seals and Adelie penguins that occupied the same sites, but apparently at different times? The proposed work includes the professional training of young researchers and incorporation of data into graduate and undergraduate courses."

Statistical analysis of this type of genetic data is complicated and computationally intensive. The new approach considered here combines methods from several mathematical disciplines. Techniques from numerical analysis, such as fast-Fourier transforms, make the proposed algorithms much faster than current methods. Stochastic approaches that efficiently simulate data provide a more reliable assessment of the methodology. <br/><br/>Many of the current methods for uncovering the genetic basis of complex diseases in humans aim to exploit the relationships between genes at loci close together on the same chromosome. These patterns depend crucially on the genetic variation at the loci involved. Consequently, there is considerable interest in understanding how these would be affected by selection. Additionally, this project will develop widely accessible, reliable software for analyzing genetic polymorphism in a way that will assess the impact of selection. Training will be provided to a graduate student who will be part of a newly formed interdisciplinary graduate program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) at the University of Idaho. This future scientist will leave the program with dramatically different training than the student's advisor.

Producing pulp for papermaking via thermomechanical pulping (TMP) of biomass is a highly energy intensive process that is performed at high temperatures. Research is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of using a directed evolution strategy and high-throughput, solid-phase enzyme library screening to engineer a new endoglucanase variant with significantly improved thermoactivity, thermostability and resistance to inhibitors. This enhanced enzyme will be sold as an additive to manufacturers who produce pulp and paper via the TMP process. Major benefits include energy savings and improvement of paper quality. <br/><br/>The commercial application of this project will be on the pulp and paper industry. New screening technology will be used to engineer an enhanced enzyme that will modify pulp fibers under high-temperature conditions. This enzyme additive will accelerate the pulp refining process and thereby lower production costs by reducing the amount of electricity needed to complete the conversion. Any significant reduction in the energy input will be very economically attractive to the pulp producers. If introducing an effective enzyme treatment could eliminate even a modest 10% of the current energy expenditure, the potential worldwide savings could total nearly US$500 million per year. The enhanced enzyme will be able to create a new market by offering these significant savings to the pulp producers. In addition, the information gained from this study could be applied to other similar enzymes to expand the market for thermostable biocatalysts and broaden the understanding of protein structure-function."

The main goals of this thematic Center are to broaden understanding of the oceans in the context of the earth and solar systems and to help the COSEE network reach rural and inland audiences. The PIs will pioneer a system of interfaces, tools, and resources to reach underserved and underrepresented groups, and to bring ocean sciences to inland audiences by presenting it in the context of more familiar components of the earth system, including environmental and space sciences. One goal is to explore the effectiveness of expanding knowledge of the ocean's role beyond being a driver of earth's climate to placing the earth in the context of its unique place in the solar system. Activities include building and training educator-scientist teams to work towards specific goals, e.g., testing strategies for effective use of ocean data, training in the use of concept mapping, and the identification and evaluation of high-quality resources. Evaluation of products, models and information is integrated throughout, with continuous self-assessment. Formal education partners at the University of Maine and University of New Hampshire will test the efficacy of materials with educators whose knowledge of ocean-related content ranges from novice to expert. Maine will be a test bed for the COSEE network to start reaching inland rural populations. The team includes scientists and educators with expertise in the hydrosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, and atmosphere. The team will develop concept maps and case studies that show application of ocean topics to the National Science Education Standards. <br/>The Center will develop a formal mechanism for scientific review of materials to ensure the products they recommend are of the highest quality and meet rigorous standards, as well as to provide feedback from educators and scientists to product developers. They will select resources from DLESE, the BRIDGE, NOAA and others and evaluate these for classroom readiness and scientific accuracy using their team of well-trained resource evaluators with first-hand knowledge of earth systems science. They also will do a ""gap analysis"" of missing resources. The ""Gap Analysis"" will also inform the science community about avoiding developing materials for well-covered topics. The review process developed by COSEE-OESS, from initial use of NASA's education product review, will be disseminated nationally as a model for evaluating best practices and assessment and evaluation guidelines for education materials.<br/> In-service teacher programs will focus on expansion of University of New Hampshire's Coastal Observing Center summer in-service teacher workshops to incorporate OESS content and evaluation of activities (""test bed"" for novel materials and activities). These workshops have annual themes focusing on ocean observing systems and the integration of buoy, shipboard, and satellite data (GoMOOS). Pre-service teachers and general science students at the University of Maine will take a new course created by OESS to learn ocean research methods by focusing on using physical principles, concepts and approaches to explain phenomena in aquatic sciences that are aligned to the NSES. The course will be developed for distribution to teachers after rigorous evaluation.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit of the Center: This thematic center focuses on creating and evaluating a series of interconnected tools and techniques designed to broaden understanding of the ocean in the context of the earth and solar systems. Results will be translated into innovative multimedia products that showcase the ocean in the earth-sun system. Educational resources will be evaluated for science and education impact, and gaps in these resources will be identified and filled. A new undergraduate course to teach about ocean phenomena will be developed, tested, and disseminated nationally. The proposed Center will help COSEE reach inland and rural audiences. <br/><br/>Broader impact: This Center will serve as a ""learning organization"" to deliver excellent products, models, and information that can be applied virtually anywhere. The final products, publication of ""Best Practices"" (a document that describes the value of system context in terms of learning) and ""Strategies to reach inland audiences"" will be disseminated throughout and beyond the COSEE network."

The proposed research is intended to provide a stronger evidentiary base to support sustained improvements in STEM settings and their subsequent diffusion. The findings from the proposed research may inform the development of STEM education in multiple educational contexts.<br/><br/>The goals of the study are (1) to determine how community and cultural concepts, and student experiences with their heritage, impact the ways they make sense of the mathematics and science they encounter in school; (2) to understand what factors are critical to properly identifying and measuring the ways in which context and culture shape the learning of science and mathematics in American Indian and Alaskan Native populations; (3) to determine ways in which teachers' practices incorporate and build upon students' experiences as conventional forms of STEM knowledge are introduced and developed in school; and (4) to develop a research-based framework and methods that can help indigenous groups assess the forms of culturally-based science and mathematics knowledge that exist within communities, and how those local forms can be related to the ones that are recognized in formal education settings.<br/><br/>To learn more about how to address these needs, in year one researchers will visit seven communities to select four that have the most prominent and varied culturally-related science and mathematics instructional programs and that offer opportunities for strong research collaboration. During the main data collection carried out in year two, researchers will spend six person-weeks spread over two field visits at each of the four selected communities. Data will be gathered systematically in five areas: sociocultural context, influence of place, interpersonal interactions, ethnically-related knowledge, and teacher practices of presenting conventional STEM knowledge.

In the presence of data streams, evaluating queries or other analyses over the data becomes a long-running, continuous process, rather than the typical one-time queries and analyses supported by traditional database systems. More generally, event-based, reactive processing as a computing paradigm is becoming more and more prevalent, spanning a wide variety of application areas. Continuous queries over data streams are an intuitive and effective approach to data management within this paradigm. Data-intensive applications of this type include network traffic monitoring and engineering, analysis of sensor network data, monitoring call-detail records or charge-card transactions for fraud detection, online analysis of financial data, manufacturing monitoring and control, and others. <br/><br/>The original work focused on basic functionality of a streaming data prototype, but additional issues have become evident as applications have been deployed. These include query processing issues, such as approximate techniques to handle system overload, performance issues based on scalability problems and issues dealing with the distributed nature of the data processing. In addition, new work on algorithms for transparent querying of multiple web services and processing of streams of approximate or uncertain data will be explored. Because stream applications frequently maintain layers of derived data products, it is particularly important to capture the connections between derived and raw data to insure effective data maintenance and analysis.<br/><br/>The history and scope of the STREAM project, coupled with the current popularity of the research area in general, positions the proposed work to have wide impact on both research and education. The project provides Ph.D.-level research and education for numerous graduate students, as well as research experience for a number of undergraduates. The graduate students give presentations and demonstrations of their work at large forums- up to hundreds of people. Research papers from the first phase of the project are being studied in graduate classes at several institutions, and the PIs have been organizing biannual meetings that bring together several data streams research groups.

Itsweire	09/30/2007	"$48,723.00"		paduan@nps.edu	1 University Circle	Monterey	CA	939435000	8316562271	GEO	1610	"0000, OTHR"	$0.00	"0526978<br/><br/>This is a proposal to conduct a simulation-based analysis of errors in high frequency (HF) radar derived ocean surface current measurements and develop means of assessing these errors in observational systems in use today. The systematic identification and description of these errors is needed for assimilation of HF radar-derived current measurements into near-shore ocean circulation models. It is also needed for incorporation into the many new operational products that are being created based on continuous maps of ocean surface currents from HF radar networks. Conclusions will be applicable to HF radar-derived current measurements in general, but analyses will focus on systems that use compact, collocated antenna geometry and direction finding techniques, such as the CODAR/SeaSonde systems. Other commercially available systems, such as the Welan Radar or WERA, can also be operated in a direction-finding configuration. The interest in HF radar systems for near-shore mapping of ocean surface currents is presently undergoing a period of rapid acceleration. Systems are already in place at numerous locations around the coastal United States as well as many other locations around the world. These systems provide near real-time measurements of the ocean circulation within the top one or two meters of the ocean surface, on a 1-3 km resolution grid, with a range over the ocean surface of about 70 km with up to 200 km for the long range units but reliable estimates of the point-by-point uncertainties in the data remain unavailable even though such error values, together with their statistical descriptions, are required for proper assimilation into numerical circulation models. While estimates of overall uncertainty levels have been provided through comparisons with in situ measurements, those comparisons on their own are not sufficient for a number of reasons. Firstly, the in situ and remote-sensing measurements are inherently different. Current meters and, to a lesser extent, drifters measure velocity at a fixed point while the radar is sensitive to the current averaged over several square kilometers. Secondly, the radar measures the current very close to the surface where measurement with conventional current meters is problematic. Thirdly, the continuous, two-dimensional coverage of the radar cannot be duplicated and, therefore systematic errors, such as pointing biases in the direction finding algorithms, cannot be assessed based solely on comparisons with in situ observations.<br/><br/>The broad impact of effective assimilation of HF current measurements in coastal areas would be felt by the scientific, coastal engineering, public safety and recreational communities through more detailed and accurate nowcasts and forecasts for ocean circulation and wave conditions with greatly improved accuracy and resolution. For example, prediction of surface flows with high spatial and temporal resolution would enhance air-sea rescue and oil and toxic spill response by allowing accurate drift forecasts. Similarly, more accurate predictions of coastal circulation could lead to forecasting shifts in marine populations from phytoplankton to whales. This project seeks to address the problem of error analysis and assessment through the use of computer simulations backed up, where appropriate, by comparisons with existing in situ data sets. The effects of a wide variety of error sources, including ship echoes, ionospheric echoes, random noise, random variations in the ocean currents within a measurement cell, imperfect knowledge of system properties, such as antenna pattern distortion, and limitations of the direction finding algorithms as a function of antenna design will be examined. A systematic look at error propagation for the commonly used HF radar configurations is overdue and that, once documented, these error models will accelerate the exploitation of these remarkable oceanographic instruments."

There is mounting evidence that liverworts (Phylum Marchantiophyta) were the first green plants to diversify on land some 500,000 million years ago and as such they are the oldest living lineage of terrestrial organisms. This species-rich group of small green plants is remarkably diverse in structure, and includes extremely ancient relictual lineages as well as more recent radiations of closely related species. The antiquity of liverworts and the rich biodiversity at all taxonomic levels provide an unparalleled window into early land plant diversification. This collaborative effort brings together experts from around the world for a multidisciplinary, highly integrated approach that combines anatomical and developmental features with DNA sequence and genome structural characters to resolve phylogenetic relationships across the entire spectrum of liverwort diversity. Three general types of data will be compiled: 1) conservative morphological and genome characters to resolve deep ""backbone"" relationships, 2) anatomical/developmental data to resolve intermediate-depth lineages, and 3) morphological and DNA sequence characters to resolve relationships among a sample of 800 taxa representing all genera of liverworts. A second major goal of the project is to integrate phylogenetic inferences and bionformatic efforts between this and other on-going NSF-supported projects, including several funded ATOL programs. These integrative activities include contributions to studies of genome structure and evolution across land plants, expansions of novel informatic tools to make methods, results, and implications widely accessible, and continued development of DNA sequence utilities that will benefit a broad range of scientists working on diverse organisms.<br/> This project relies on the cooperation with and integration among research programs focused on resolving the green plant Tree Of Life. Integrative activities are substantive and consequential, and include expansions to phylogenetic databases and methodological/conceptual aspects of work toward resolving the Tree Of Life. At least six post-doctoral associates and as many graduate students will be supported by the project, with substantial involvement of undergraduates as well. An effort to involve and retain individuals from underrepresented groups will be orchestrated through established federal programs that focus on such initiatives, including the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and the McNair Scholars Program. A solid mentoring infrastructure will be developed within each research team to provide support and professional experiences that ensure productivity and success of all participants. Outreach efforts include web presentations on the morphology and identification of liverworts for educators at all levels, development of web-based materials and a workshop targeting secondary school teachers, and increasing public awareness through weekend field excursions."

However, if enough pressure is applied, the nails will pierce the skin surface. This phenomenon can also be observed at the nanometer-scale. Under certain conditions, a solid surface is suspended on a dense array of nanostructures while at other conditions, the surface is imprinted by the nanostructure array. <br/>In this project, the investigator and his colleagues study nanometer-scale solid surface deformation associated with solid surface suspension and imprinting caused by high grafting density contacts and molecular interactions at the interface. Carbon nanotube arrays of high grafting density, greater than hundred million arrays per square millimeter, are used to study nanoscale contact suspension of plastically deforming solids and imprintability of high density nanoscale contacts. <br/>The study is motivated by the need to develop effective technology for fabricating surface nanostructures and intended to further understanding of nanoscale friction and wear. The former includes nano-imprinting as well as nano-planarization of gold molds for nano-imprinting lithography. Nano-imprinting lithography can not only produce extremely small features but greatly simplify many production processes and lower production cost substantially. The semiconductor industry is currently developing nano-imprinting lithography to build chips with circuits as narrow as 30 nanometers width or less. The latter comprises mainly solid lubrication with nanostructures for dry machining. Dry machining, without liquid lubricant, is necessary to build environmentally-safe manufacturing infrastructures for mass production of lightweight structures. The automotive industry is currently developing a nano-structured coating on tool surfaces to machine aluminum parts with the dry friction coefficient as low as 0.02 or less.<br/>The intellectual merit of the work is to provide fundamental understanding of mechanisms of contact interface deformation at the nanoscale and to establish a systematic framework for assessing reliability of nano-fabrication and the use of solid nanostructures. In terms of broader impact, Stan Williams of Hewlett-Packard has stated, ""imprint technology has the potential to revolutionize the semiconductor industry as well as a host of other fields, from data storage to optical networking to life sciences,"" indicating potential major impact on information technology as well as on nano-technology. In addition, it will make broad impact on bio and environmental technology with surface nano-structure sensors and filters, and on materials, manufacturing and energy technology with nanostructured carbon-based coatings for dry machining of light weight structures. Also under this project, it is planned to educate under-represented REU students through summer internship programs and to develop a new course in the field of nanomechanics."

The information gathered by applying the statistical learning techniques will be used to improve the scientific understanding of ITCZ dynamics and breakdown. <br/><br/>One goal of the project is to develop statistical methods that identify dynamical features in satellite data for the tropics. These data include visible and infra-red imagery, scatterometer winds (QuikSCAT data), rainfall estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission satellite, and liquid cloud water content from microwave measurements, together with derived quantities such as relative vorticity fields. Of particular interest are the shape, location and intensity of relative vorticity pools within the ITCZ, thought to be related to ITCZ breakdown. These parameters will first be estimated from instantaneous two-dimensional data fields, primarily the combination of the QuickSCAT data and visible and infra-red data from the GEOS satellite. The project will then go on to identify these parameters in time sequences of imagery using several statistical techniques. Parameter estimation within the ITCZ will be extended to include the estimation of non-ITCZ disturbances which may affect ITCZ dynamics, such as ""westward-propagating disturbances"". The algorithms developed will be tested by applying them to unseen data and comparing the results to human-produced annotation of the images. Initial development will use fields generated by numerical model simulations of ITCZ dynamics, including simulations of breakdown by internal vorticity-mode instabilities as well as ITCZ breakdowns induced by interaction with westward-propagating disturbances. The sequences of maps of ITCZ structure will be made available via the web as a data product.<br/><br/>Once developed, the statistical techniques just described will be used to produce sequences of ITCZ state that will then be used to determine the different modes of breakdown exhibited by the ITCZ and their relative frequency. There will also be an examination of the relative frequency of shallow and deep ITCZs, and the influence of tropical disturbances on meridional mixing, as well as a search for evidence of whether Madden-Julien oscillations influence ITCZ dynamics, including breakdown. In the later stages of the project, the statistical learning techniques will be applied to high-resolution atmospheric model output. The statistics on ITCZ states derived from the general circulation model will be compared with those derived from the satellite data to examine quantitatively whether there is any systematic bias in the behavior of the ITCZ in the atmospheric circulation model. The researchers will also attempt to derive state sequences of the ITCZ from GOES data alone, comparing the results with those obtained from the combination of GOES satellite data and scatterometer wind data. If this is successful, the evolution of ITCZ dynamics will be studied over the period 1979-2005, using the raw GOES data as input to the analysis. This will permit a search for correlations between variations in ITCZ dynamics and decadal climate variability.<br/><br/>This project includes education and training opportunities for a post-doctoral investigator and a graduate student. The techniques developed may be applicable to other types of satellite and non-satellite imagery. Dissemination of results will be by the standard methods of presentations at scientific meetings and in peer-reviewed journal articles; however data products developed by the project will be made publicly available via a web-site."

The PI wishes to learn more about molecular biology, specially on gene expressions, and applying mathematical techniques to medical science. He will focus primarily on three projects during the proposed period: (a) Improvement of peak detection and quantification of mass spectrometry (MS) data from lung cancer patients by using wavelets, (b) Survival modeling for lung cancer patients using spline functions, and (c) Mathematical analysis of support vector machine (SVM) classification and applications in cancer data.<br/><br/>The proposal is an interdisciplinary research project with an educational emphasis in statistics, computational mathematics, actuarial science, and quantitative biological study in cancers. The PI plans to participate in variety of seminars on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometer, biostatistics, and on support vector machine classification and applications at the medical school of Vanderbilt University. He will audit the courses of topics in molecular biology and biostatistics to broaden his knowledge and enhance skills in molecular data analysis and classification. The PI will select some projects for his masters students as thesis topics for further study using splines for modeling. At the same time, the PI will focus on topics on wavelet applications to gene expression data and will study SVM for data classification.<br/><br/>The objective of the proposal is both research and educational. On the research side, the PI expects to establish a long term collaboration with researchers in biostatistics and medical science, with results disseminated in both the mathematical and statistical literatures, as well as directly to medical science and actuarial science. On the educational side, the PI will give seminar talks on splines and wavelets for biostatisticians and students at Vanderbilt University. He will bring new methods and ideas, and the experiences gained back to his home university with the goal of enhancing both graduate and undergraduate education in multiple programs there.<br/><br/>The PI believes this experience will contribute to the development of a new Institution of Quantitative Biology at ETSU, which will greatly enhance the research and education program among the college of medicine and the departments of mathematics, biology, and public health. Also, areas of expertise of the PI such as in wavelets, splines, multivariate approximation, mathematical statistics, and risk analysis will provide to the biostatistics group, which is useful for medical data study at Vanderbilt University.<br/><br/>This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS)."

Additional methodological approaches are necessary to characterize the role of such visual cortical activity during non-visual perception and the underlying neural mechanisms. With National Science Foundation funding, this research embodies a collaboration among Drs. Krishnankutty Sathian, John Foxe, and Charles Schroeder that brings different techniques to bear on the issue of multisensory form processing in extrastriate visual cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans is being combined with event-related potential (ERP) studies in humans and neurophysiologic studies in macaque monkeys, using experimental designs common to the three methods. The high spatial resolution of fMRI and the high temporal resolution of ERP studies are mutually complementary and allow specification of the temporal profile of neural activity, as well as precise localization. Monkey studies entail a combination of field potential and action potential analyses that allow both direct comparison to human (ERP/fMRI) data and investigation of the cellular bases of ERP and fMRI effects. Specific Aim I investigates the recruitment of visual cortical activity by tactile form discriminations and Specific Aim II explores multisensory interactions between vision and touch, during tactile form perception. The combination of three complementary experimental approaches being brought to bear on a common set of questions, using a common set of tasks, is unique and promises to provide a much more complete picture of the relevant neural processes than any of the approaches in isolation. This tripartite approach allows the acquisition of convergent evidence on the specific brain mechanisms of multisensory interactions, which are increasingly recognized to be ubiquitous and essential for sensory processing as well as other aspects of cognition. <br/><br/>Among its broader impacts, this project exemplifies the value of bringing multiple experimental approaches to bear on a set of issues. The project is anticipated to lead eventually to improvement in assistive technology available to individuals with sensory deprivation of any kind. By establishing a long-term collaboration between the three principal investigators, students and post-doctoral trainees will be able to acquire expertise in more than one of the experimental approaches, interact with more than one mentor, and further, train explicitly in the emerging field of multisensory science, a field with few formal training opportunities."

The goals include increasing the number of minority students enrolled, the establishment of permanent infrastructure on each campus to support diversity, the establishment of permanent programs on each campus and across the alliance to support diversity and a diverse population of graduate students, and the development of a publishable set of techniques and guidelines that can be used by any university and which we hope will lead to a national forum for the exchange of ideas and best practices for promoting diversity. The four key elements of the alliance include: 1) alliance-level activities (e.g., an annual student research conference and the creation of common recruiting materials and coordinated recruiting efforts; 2) recruitment through the implementation of an Alliance Visiting Scholars Program and coordination of recruiting efforts at major conferences, fairs and university visits; 3) increased retention of students by recruiting a cadre of social and behavioral professors and scholars who will provide instant, multi-level mentoring network and developing transition programs; and 4) increased activities and programs targeted at undergraduates in a wider range of universities and colleges to increase the pool of students. The number of universities in the alliance will allow the alliance to analyze the effectiveness of new strategies for broadening participation and the transference of existing techniques to new settings. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The alliance will develop written materials that can be distributed to all universities in the US and could be the basis for a national exchange of ideas about alliances as a strategy to broaden participation in US institutions of higher learning."

This project details the expectations, attitudes, and epistemologies of graduate teaching assistants towards educational reform, and develops a learning environment to help them overcome problems. The project is addressing two issues surrounding the education and professional development of physics graduate students. Graduate student teaching assistants (TAs) are often expected to play significant roles in implementing ""collaborative active learning"" sessions, where students work in small groups. However, many TAs have trouble teaching in this format, partly because of their views about how students learn. Also, some physics graduate students do not continue to develop conceptual expertise, reaching a deep level of qualitative understanding of core physical concepts that facilitates both research and teaching. This is because graduate coursework often stresses mathematical methods rather than conceptual expertise. The professional development of TAs in physics departments is typically handled separately from graduate education in physics. Research suggests, however, that it might be effective and efficient to foster conceptual expertise and teaching expertise in a unified way. <br/>In this pilot project the investigators are creating and teaching a professional development seminar designed to help graduate students develop sophisticated teaching practices and ""learning theories"" to apply both to their teaching and to their own learning. The project is conducting research on the ways in which the structure of TA seminars and associated teaching in a reformed introductory physics course changes TAs' teaching, conceptual expertise, and epistemologies - their views about the nature of knowledge and learning. Teachers' epistemologies strongly affect their success at implementing collaborative active-learning materials. One issue is the extent to which TAs think students can learn from listening to mini-lectures vs. working through problems for themselves. Another is the importance they attach to addressing everyday experiences and preconceptions as part of learning physics. Thus, the investigators are observing graduate students who are participating in this project using a variety of methods (including periodic interviews and videotaped observations of their teaching) to probe their epistemologies and their approaches to teaching and learning. By comparing TAs in the program to an absolute standard of effective practice and by analyzing in depth the trajectories of their epistemologies and teaching practices, the investigators are developing hypotheses that can be tested rigorously in a subsequent project. <br/>TAs in the sciences include almost all of the next generation of university science faculty; in physics they are involved in much of the actual delivery of introductory physics classes, typically responsible for all small-group environments. Since many of the most effective instructional innovations developed for introductory college-level physics are delivered in small-group environments, the ability of TAs to deliver reformed instruction is critical to the success or failure of a reform."

Kaplan, Anthony K. Aufdenkampe, J. Denis Newbold, Robert H. Findlay, and Peggy H. Ostrom<br/><br/>Naturally occurring organic molecules dissolved in water constitute the largest pool of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems. Within streams and rivers, molecules that originate in terrestrial vegetation and are modified within soils and groundwater by microorganisms during movement to the channel, are the dominant source of organic matter. These terrestrially derived molecules in transport downstream contribute to the biologically useful chemical energy present in freshwater and coastal marine environments. Our research uses a novel application of stable isotopes to quantify those contributions throughout a drainage network, and we frame our investigations within the context of scaling rules that facilitate the transfer of information from one habitat or system to others. We will grow young deciduous trees in an atmosphere enriched with the stable isotope of carbon, harvest and compost the trees, and extract the compost to prepare a leachate of complex, microbially modified molecules, and follow the fate of those organic molecules in systems which range from small laboratory reactors to a 5th order stream. Combining scaling rules derived from the knowledge of how streams ""grow"" as they flow towards the ocean with scaling rules associated with nutrient uptake in streams, allows us to test hypotheses concerning how organic molecules are used for energy within a stream network. <br/><br/>This research has broad implications for the use of scaling rules in ecological studies and for the drinking water industry where organic molecules provide both nutrients for the unwanted growth of microorganisms in distribution systems and the building blocks for the carcinogenic byproducts of disinfection. Our approach also may provide a predictive tool that can be used to learn about the fate and transport of anthropogenic contaminants that are transported downstream through their association with naturally occurring organic molecules."

With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Heller will examine how the human auditory system uses time-varying acoustic information to support the perception of auditory events. In an unprecedented series of experiments, Dr. Heller will bring rigorous experimental methods to bear on the study of real-world auditory events such as breaking glasses and bouncing balls. The experiments are designed to discover the relationship between event properties, such as sound-generating materials and their dynamics, and their resulting event percepts. The aim is to bridge the gap between the detailed knowledge that we have of low-level auditory processing and the more ecologically-valid, but understudied, perception of events in the world. Results from these experiments will serve as the basis for further work on the complex interactions among event properties that give rise to larger-scale events. An additional benefit to the academic community will be the construction of an extensive environmental sound database that will be made freely available over the web."

Current theory predicts that predators impact the dynamics of host-parasite systems --improving the health of the host population. This suggests that predator control reduces the health of prey (host) populations, and attempts to control feral animals, such as cats and dogs that prey on rodents, should lead to increased levels of parasites in the rodents. The result can be subsequent increases in human disease risk. However, this project developed preliminary analyses to show that this is not the case, under certain well-defined conditions. The project will extend these theoretical analyses and field studies will be performed to test the predictions of the models. The field system uses house cats as predators of juvenile rats and examines patterns of viral infection in Norway rats. These studies are conducted in urban residential neighborhoods where Norway rats are common. Key parameters of infection status, movement, reproduction, survival and growth of Norway rats will be examined and the response of cats to the abundance of rats will be monitored. The model will be evaluated by predicting rates of infection at additional locations and these sites will be sampled to compare the predictions with the observed patterns of infection."

The study and model development will focus on this protozoan parasite because T. gondii is the major cause of death in southern sea otters, and otters serve as a valuable sentinel for marine pollution with this important human pathogen. Focusing on two coastal sites where T. gondii infections and mortality in sea otters are prevalent, this integrated study has three components that link terrestrial ecology to land use patterns and ultimately to sea otter ecology. Investigators from University of California at Davis, California State University at Fresno, Institute of Ecosystems Study, and University of British Columbia will predict terrestrial environmental contamination with oocysts and risk of exposure to T. gondii based on the prevalence of infection in domestic felids and wild rodent populations. The investigators hypothesize that there is a distinct spatial pattern of risk for otters because land runoff forms well-defined zones at specific locations in coastal waters, and high oocyst concentrations are expected in these zones. Finally, they propose to study whether individual otter diet and movements can predict the risk of exposure and death from protozoal encephalitis caused by T. gondii infection. Data from the three components will permit evaluating the impact of alternative control strategies using simulation modeling to test whether reduction of putative risk factors will reduce site-specific incidence and prevalence of T. gondii in otters. This project is unique in its multidisciplinary and comprehensive approach - incorporating terrestrial and marine ecologists, oceanographers, epidemiologists, and parasitologists to investigate the ecology of an important environmental pathogen at the interface of terrestrial and aquatic systems. <br/><br/>In terms of the broader impacts of this study, this project emphasizes graduate student training in research and outreach. Overall, 4 Ph.D. and 2 Masters students will be mentored in research and outreach efforts. The simulation model will permit evaluation of different control strategies to reduce pathogen pollution of the near shore marine environment. This will benefit the threatened southern sea otter population that is struggling to recover, as well as other marine wildlife and humans in coastal areas. Sea otters are a flagship species with extremely high visibility, which provides a unique opportunity to inform the public about the land-sea interface and pathogen pollution. A public website www.seaotterresearch.org will be expanded to include specific information on the goals of this study and to publicize the findings in a public-friendly format with special interactive sections devoted to younger students (K-8), land and water resource managers, and cat owners. A brochure explaining risks of toxoplasmosis, suggested best practices for cat owners, and methods to reduce environmental exposure to T. gondii will be provided to the cat-owning public through pet product retailers and veterinarians in coastal areas. Sea otter bookmarks with the web address will also be provided at no cost through pet product retailers and schools in the high impact areas. Public town hall meetings will be organized and attended by senior personnel and students at both study sites to inform and discuss with local residents the rationale, design and findings of the study. Each of the graduate students involved in the project will be trained in public relations/speaking and will be required to make at least 2 presentations per year at schools and public meetings in high-risk communities. In addition, to original research publications, students will present the results of this research at national scientific conferences."

The application system is on chemical fog concentration reduction or elimination. A group of moving sensors make distributed measurements of the diffusion process to characterize the diffusion process (sniffing), meanwhile, the dynamic data sensed is fed to a group of mobile robots equipped with neutralizer dispensers (spraying) to contain the chemical fog. Fundamental research issues include sensing policy, actuation policy, formation regulation and tracking, and optimal path planning. In this one-year exploratory DDDAS project, the PI specifically attacks the optimal interlaced distributed control and distributed measurement with networked mobile actuators and sensors, which will lay a foundation for characterizing and neutralizing multiple, possibly evolving, chemical sources, on and underground, by a team of ground mobile robots equipped with networked sensors (detectors) and actuators (neutralizers). <br/><br/>The proposed research and educational efforts will have a significant impact on the development of mobile actuator and sensor networks for national security interests, water resources, precision agriculture, ecological and environmental monitoring; the creation of interdisciplinary research and environment; recruiting and retaining engineering students. As a motivating example, imagine that a hostile toxic diffusion source is being released and diffusing with no color and no smell. It is very desirable to send a team of mobile robots to sniff around and, meanwhile, dispatch another team of mobile robots to spray/neutralize the diffusion process. Since these robots are networked via wireless links, thus the name ""mobile actuator and sensor networks."" It is a hard problem to decide where to sniff and where to spray for each individual mobility node when various constraints exist such as limited battery life and obstacles. This project focuses on optimal interlaced distributed control and distributed measurement with networked mobile actuators and sensors.

This project provides a new, unique exciting challenge to push the boundary of emerging distributed control system theories with a clear dynamic data driven flavor."

The behavior of such system networks depends on their linkages and the environment, i.e. scientific reductionism is incapable of fully defining behavior. These applications are typically characterized by hierarchical control and horizontally, interdependent components (federates), and in a dynamic environment require the whole or sub system(s) to respond adaptively to changes in an accurate and timely manner for improved performance.<br/><br/>This project focuses on hierarchical production and logistics planning and control in highly capitalized discrete manufacturing system networks. The overall scheme envisioned is a multi-scale federation of interwoven simulation and decision models that support planning and control with dynamic updating through sensed and streamed data. Planning and control models are updated both directly from real-world sensed data and from simulations. While the real world may yield parameters such as current costs or inventory status, the simulation model, in synchronization with other federates representing the other entities in the supply network, will be used to compute more complex model parameters such as lead times and effective resource availabilities. In addition, the simulation model will be used off-line to test the performance of various proposed decision rules/models and guide the selection of model construction and selection at each re-planning instance. Re-planning will occur when a defined threshold of discordance between actual observation and model form used to construct the active plan is reached.<br/><br/>To accomplish these goals the project will investigate methods for the development of an integrated architecture for distributed computing in networked sensor-driven, hierarchical decision and control systems of the distributed enterprise. This architecture, which is based on ubiquitous web service technology, will allow an integrated collection of multi-scale models that support the simulation, decision and control functions to interact with transducers. The proposed architecture will facilitate integration in several ways: developing a continuous sensor-driven approach to planning and control coordination; interoperability of different genres of models for distributed systems; integration of sensor/actuator interactions with a variety of models; integration of different genres of sensors/actuators that conform to different standards; integration of sensor measurements in the model validation process."

One of these compounds is indole-3-acetic acid, an important member of the class of plant growth regulators called auxins. Indole-3-acetic acid is synthesized by virtually all plant species. In the cruciferous plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, tryptophan is also used to produce the plant defense compounds indole glucosinolates (IGs) and camalexin. There is evidence in Arabidopsis for intricate cross-talk between the biosynthetic pathways used to produce these different tryptophan-derived compounds. The secondary metabolite profile in the non-crucifer tobacco does not include IGs or camalexin. Thus, tobacco provides a tractable alternative model system in which Trp metabolism can be compared to that of Arabidopsis.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand how the interactions among tryptophan metabolism pathways are the same or different between Arabidopsis and other plant species that do not produce the same spectrum of tryptophan-derived compounds as Arabidopsis. The research scope of this project is twofold:<br/>1) Use previously identified mutant plants perturbed in tryptophan metabolism to define the role of compounds predicted to serve as intermediate steps for the biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid. In addition, new mutants disrupted in these metabolic pathways will be identified.<br/>2) Determine which known indole-3-acetic acid biosynthetic pathways contribute to the formation of a chemically distinct naturally occurring auxin called indole-3-butyric acid. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include the training of graduate students in biochemical and genetic methodologies. This training will prepare them for more advanced positions in the fields of plant biochemistry and metabolomics. In addition, this research will be carried out as collaboration among three institutions (University of Massachusetts Amherst, Boston University and Lincoln University) that are partner institutions in an NSF-supported alliance designed to increase the number of minorities in the professoriate of science technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Interactions between the three labs will be facilitated by having students from Lincoln University participate in ongoing summer minority research programs in the laboratories of the PIs from University of Massachusetts and Boston University. Co-mentorship of Lincoln University students among the three PIs will facilitate the identification, recruiting and mentoring of minority students with an interest in plant biology graduate programs."

The energy infrastructure located in the affected zones has fundamental importance in terms of the operation and performance of the U.S. energy system, which comprises the production, transportation, storage, and conversion of electricity, water, coal, and gas.<br/><br/>After the destructive effects of hurricane Katrina were revealed, there was an almost immediate nationwide increase in energy prices and an instant sense of uncertainty in the energy industry about energy availability and prices for the forthcoming months. Because of the enormous complexity of the U.S. energy system, because of the existence of complex interdependencies and interactions between the different infrastructures, and because of the complex sequence of human decision-making associated with bulk energy production, transportation, conversion (generation), and delivery in the integrated energy industry, it is certainly not clear at this point how the hurricane Katrina will really affect the energy supply in terms of economic efficiency and energy availability.<br/><br/>The U.S. energy system is composed of many interrelated energy subsystems. Three major subsystems for raw energy (coal, gas, and water) share with electricity the common characteristic that they can be moved in bulk quantities via a transportation network from the source of their production to the site of their use. These different transportation networks are highly coupled, and it is mainly through the electricity subsystem that these couplings take place.<br/><br/>System interdependencies are hard to notice under normal operating conditions. When a major perturbation strikes the system, these interdependencies are likely to be revealed. The collection of data of such events and its posterior analysis is of high utility to adequately model the interdependencies and dynamics of the energy system and so to recognize the essential infrastructure that, if disrupted, may adversely affect the performance of other infrastructures. Stressed operating conditions of a highly interconnected and interdependent system will result in a change in the normal behavior of the decision-making processes. The study of the decision-making processes under extreme operating conditions will help to gain better understandings of the social and structural factors affecting the decision-making processes of system participants.<br/><br/>Data collection from energy industries operating in the affected zone is of extreme importance in order to obtain a better understanding of the impact of catastrophic events in the energy system, to appreciate how events propagate geographically and in time, and to study infrastructure interdependencies. Acquiring such knowledge will be also very helpful in order to help prevent the most harmful effects, raise awareness about infrastructure vulnerabilities, and to improve the government and industry reaction capacity in the aftermath of catastrophic events. Furthermore, details about interdependent failure modes (cascading, escalating, and common cause failures), and also about the information flows among the decision makers, are data that by their own nature may be perishable. Therefore, it is very important to collect all this vital information while the information is still available.<br/><br/>The objective of the project for which we request funds through this proposal is data collection in two complementary fronts, infrastructure interdependence failure data and decision-making processes under extreme conditions. An important portion of the data that this research project intends to gather is perishable data, therefore there is need to collect it before long from the field."

All living things require fixed N for biosynthesis and N-fixing microbes in soils provide the dominant natural source of N in many terrestrial ecosystems. Despite their ancient and enduring ecological importance remarkably littleis known about the ecology and evolution of these microorganisms and of soil microbes in general. This research effort will implement a novel approach that combines stable isotope probing in concert with environmental genomics to target the genomes of non-cultivated diazotrophs. This approach will allow access to genomic DNA from these non-cultivated microbes, providing a remarkable opportunity to advance our understanding of the environmental and genomic mechanisms that regulate the diversity and activity of a microbial process of central importance to the global N-cycle. The genome sequences obtained will help shed light on the evolution of N-fixation and on genome evolution in general by revealing the complex structure of nitrogenase supraoperons in previously uncharacterized microorganisms. In addition, by using this microbial community as a model, this research will reveal basic principles pertaining to the functional significance of microbial diversity and the mechanisms that regulate microbial process in soils. Thus, this project will have both specific and far reaching effects that will improve understanding of microbial processes in the soil, and the ability to effectively manage terrestrial ecosystems. <br/><br/>As part of this project an educational program will be developed that is composed of three components designed to increase science literacy, to improve awareness of microbiology, and to train the next generation of environmental genomics researchers. The first component is a summer workshop ""The Microbial Earth"" that will provide high school science teachers with modules allowing them to implement open ended laboratory exercises in their curricula and will provide equipment and assistance to help them achieve their teaching goals. The second component is a web module called ""Bioprospecting on the Frontiers of Microbiology"" for the Cornell CyberTower site. This multimedia module will highlight the role of environmental genomics in discovering novel modes of life and valuable new enzymes. The last component is an advanced undergraduate course in environmental genomics to test the idea of using undergraduates in genomics cooperatives to achieve the dual goals of providing students with primary research experience while contributing to the analysis and annotation of raw genome data."

This project aims to contribute to the description and analysis of Arabic by focusing on one of its unique features - emphasis. Emphasis is a distinctive feature of Semitic languages such as Arabic and Hebrew that refers to a group of consonants produced with a secondary constriction in the posterior vocal tract and a primary constriction typically in the dental/alveolar region. The characteristics of emphasis are not confined to emphatic consonants themselves but can spread to adjacent segments as well. With support from the Linguistics Program and the Office of International Science & Engineering, Dr. Allard Jongman will conduct a detailed acoustic and perceptual investigation of emphasis. Acoustic analysis will include a variety of measurements of both consonants and vowels. Perception experiments will then evaluate the relative contribution of the emphatic consonant and adjacent vowels to the perception of emphasis. This research will document and enhance an understanding of the sound structure of Arabic. This project will examine a sizeable number of stimuli produced by a number of different speakers, thereby allowing for an assessment of differences in gender and dialect. In addition, the symmetrical or asymmetrical nature of the spread, the extent to which it diminishes as the distance from the emphatic increases, and the characteristics of potential blocking segments will have significant implications for phonological theory. <br/><br/>This research will enable linguists to test hypotheses on many aspects of the sound structure of Arabic in addition to emphasis, with the complete set of audio recordings from the project available through a web-based database. These data can also be used by Arabic language teachers to develop teaching materials that provide detailed information about unique aspects of the Arabic language. The broader impact of this project includes opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in linguistic research. This research will also be the start of a collaboration with several universities in Jordan. As such, this project will foster international cooperation, with the hope that this collaboration will eventually develop into a partnership, an exchange between faculty and students, and ultimately contribute to better cultural understanding."

A searchable index of all mutations contained in a collection can be constructed by sequencing genomic DNA flanking each insertion. The value of sequence indexed insertional mutation resources for functional genomics is clearly demonstrated by the Arabidopsis T-DNA and Ds resources. Creation of a similar resource for maize will add enormous value to the complete maize genome sequence. However, creation of a comprehensive sequence indexed transposon resource for maize using conventional sequencing technologies is costly. Hence, there is a clear need for new approaches that reduce the cost of sequence indexing of insertions. The massively parallel DNA sequencing platform developed by the 454 Corporation is an emerging, transformative technology that is especially powerful for applications such as transposon indexing that 1) can benefit from the very deep sampling coverage attainable with large numbers of relatively short (100 to 200 base pairs) sequence reads and 2) can leverage an existing or emerging reference genome sequence. Application of 454 technology promises to reduce the cost of indexing Mu insertions in the maize genome by as much as 2 orders of magnitude making comprehensive coverage of the maize genome feasible. Moreover, the deep sequence coverage would enable efficient pooling strategies that will allow indexing of Mu transposon populations in multiple genetic (e.g. inbred) backgrounds. <br/><br/>In this project, Mu insertions from DNA pools made from two well-characterized transposon populations, MTM and UniformMu, having different genetic backgrounds will be sampled. In addition, the efficiency of two different PCR protocols and pooling schemes for amplifying Mu flanking sequences will be evaluated. The successful application of 454 technology to sequence indexing of insertional mutagens will likely catalyze rapid and innovative advances in functional genomics of plants and other organisms.<br/><br/>The resulting resources will be publicly accessed through Genbank Genome Survey Sequences (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), MTM (mtm.cshl.edu) and UniformMu (uniformmu.org) websites."

The first section describes ongoing efforts to build a large public-use micro-price archive patterned after the International Comparison Project. Key differences are the level of aggregation and the frequency of data. The ICP is based on international price surveys at 5-year intervals, interpolated to annual frequencies. Aggregation across goods and locations is conducted by national statistical agencies. Aggregation across locations within a country is necessary to achieve the goal of producing a national deflator. This project's ongoing efforts to compile micro-price data are motivated by a desire to unearth empirical facts that more clearly distinguish alternative theories of relative price determination than is possible with data commonly available. For example, the New Open Economy Macroeconomics is built upon the assumption that the Law-of-One-Price holds in the steady-state and that all goods are equally 'sticky' (usually) in domestic currency terms. This contrasts with the conventional dichotomy between traded and non-traded goods, with traded goods having smaller steady-state deviations from the Law-of-One-Price (i.e., shipping costs) and adjusting more quickly to the steady-state than non-traded goods. In our view this debate has been systematically biased by the use of aggregative index number data in place of micro-data. Aggregation is problematic because it inevitably involves averaging of deviations across traded and non-traded goods, thereby obscuring the differences between the two. The research from the previous NSF award demonstrated how the characteristics of goods (extent of trade and importance of non-traded inputs) influenced geographic price dispersion and relative price persistence. However, the investigators faced data limitations: their results on geographic price dispersion were confined to the EU while those for persistence involved the OECD and a sub-set of developing countries over a limited time period (the 1990s). The second section of this proposal uses the Economist Intelligence Unit data, spanning both intranational and global price comparisons to explore the earlier results in a broader empirical setting. The investigators organize their analysis around a simple partial equilibrium model of retail price determination in which each retail good is a composite of a traded and non-traded input. Taking various ""cuts"" at the data (i.e. cross-sectional, time series, geographic, and good-specific variation), the investigators demonstrate the model's ability to match many features of the data. The third part of the project will examine the robustness of prior findings in novel empirical settings; take the empirical work in new directions; and will assess the relative merit of alternative state-of-the-art models in accounting for the cross-sectional and time series behavior of international relative prices from the level of individual goods up to aggregative price levels.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The data from this project archives will be at the level of individual goods and services in particular locations (typically these will be large cities, though some of the data extends down to the level of retail establishments). Each individual archive represents a substantial increase in available micro-data in existence for research purposes. The investigators also plan to make existing micro-price databases that have been used in published research available on the same internet site."

Most studies of nutrient transport have focused on single components of the watershed such as a stream or lake, but little is know about how combinations of streams and lakes that exist in watersheds influence these processes. Our work will address how interacting complexes of lakes, lake bottoms (littoral zones), streams, and their subsurface component (hyporheic zones) interact to influence nitrogen transport through watersheds in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho. We suggest that in simple watersheds without lakes or highly developed hyporheic zones, nutrients will runoff quickly during spring snowmelt so that little is left to fuel the growth of aquatic plants (phytoplankton, periphyton) latter in the summer. However, we expect that in complex watersheds with many lakes, the spring pulse of nitrogen will be dampened, thus providing a more stable supply of this nutrient than in simple watersheds. If nutrient delivery is stabilized, we expect that growth of phytoplankton and periphyton will also be less pulsed and thus increase ecosystem stability. We will test these ideas by measuring nutrient movement at small spatial scales with the stable isotope of nitrogen (15N), using those rates to model how nutrient transport occurs within whole watersheds, and then testing our model predictions with a whole-drainage tracer experiment and with large-scale watershed measurements of nutrient flux and algal growth in lakes and streams. To broaden the impact of our work, we will collaborate with educators to develop curricula for elementary school children, and make modules available for web-based learning."

The predicted particle orientation distribution will be used along with micro-mechanical models to predict the stiffness variation throughout an injection molded part. A key element is the development of the rheological methodology which will provide basic material flow properties to the numerical simulation package. An experimental evaluation of the predicted particle orientation distribution for basic flows associated with injection molding will be carried out to assess the performance of the simulation. <br/><br/>There are numerous societal benefits to this work. By incorporating models in which the flow and structure are coupled along with viscoelasticity, it is expected that the design of molds and selection of injection molding conditions will be significantly improved and accelerated for reinforced TP's. This will help improve the ability of US automakers to compete in the world-wide automotive market as design changes can be made more rapidly and cheaply. Once a simulation package is developed for injection molding, it can easily be extended to other processes such as compression molding and injection-compression molding. From an educational view graduate students will learn that the properties of composite parts are highly dependent on processing conditions and the potential to predict this relation exists. Furthermore, the students will learn the importance of a cooperative effort in solving complex problems as the engineering student will learn about numerical simulation using the finite element method while the mathematics student will learn about transport processes and the rheology of structured fluids. This project is a cooperative effort between Virginia Tech and DOE laboratories (ORNL and PNWL) and is co-funded by NSF and DOE's FreedomCAR program."

(CUAHSI). CUAHSI has prepared a science agenda that identifies the interfaces among traditional boundaries among the atmosphere, land surface, groundwater and surface-water subdisciplines as the most promising areas for research. Substantive progress will only be achieved with multidisciplinary approaches applied at larger spatial scales to obtain coherent data sets than have typically been done in the past. CUAHSI envisages four mutually supportive infrastructure elements to meet this goal: 1) a network of hydrologic observatories, 2) an information system, 3) a measurement technologies program, and 4) a hydrologic synthesis facility. This project requests funds to provide a core support for the development and management of these facilities as well as to initiate the observatories and synthesis facility.<br/>Because this scale of coordinated research has not been previously attempted by the hydrologic science community, we propose to begin with a 'paper prototype' of a single river basin (a hydrologic observatory) designed to address a small set of specific hypotheses carefully chosen to yield a data set that will provide a robust characterization of the basin. Thus a data set sufficient to answer important questions and broad enough to be useful for many studies will emerge. The prototype will identify both the scientific and economic synergies from coordinating research in a single river basin. The Neuse River has been chosen as the site for this prototype.<br/>The second proposed activity is to initiate a hydrologic synthesis facility, envisioned as a place where hydrologic scientists from various disciplines can come together conveniently and at low marginal cost to tackle central problems in the field. A workshop to design the facility and funding for an initial synthesis project, including a competition for its selection, are proposed.<br/>This project will permit hydrologic science to make fundamental advances by providing facilities with capabilities currently unavailable to the community. These activities have been chosen to provide the greatest return on investment to move hydrologic science to a new plane of understanding. The benefits to society of improved hydrologic understanding are manifold, including more reliable forecasting of conditions and wiser management of water resources."

This project puts forward a comprehensive, multidisciplinary research approach to characterize and model human cognitive driving behavior and subsequent response in traffic flow systems. Specifically, the dynamics of driver behavior, taken at the individual level and as part of a group, evolving over time and space will be systematically studied as a complex system. By developing behavior-based models of human decision-making in traffic situations and integrating the behavior models in computer simulation systems, the study addresses fundamental questions in traffic science and promises to improve prevailing understanding of traffic flow phenomena as well as the fidelity and reliability of the current state of the art of traffic flow simulation. The outcome of the project will reveal the interrelationship between microscopic elements of driver behavior (e.g. reaction times and other time lags, over-reaction, risk averse and risk seeking behaviors in car following and lane changing) and macroscopic traffic flow phenomena through analytical investigation and simulation, validated by field observation. The subject of the investigation entails considerable economic and social significance, with wide application in human cognitive science, as well as in traffic operations and management. The project also provides an excellent and unique opportunity for student exposure to cross-disciplinary research and helps build a diverse scientific workforce."

Nitrogen loadings to the oceans have increased dramatically over the past three decades, while P increases have been more limited. Riverborne and atmospheric NOx inputs have driven several ecosystems into suboxic conditions. The combination of these two factors suggests that coastal marine environments will be increasingly P limited. The degree to which this limits eutrophication depends upon how low oxygen levels shift sedimentary remineralization. <br/><br/>For this reason, researchers from the University of Texas, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the University of South Carolina plan to assess the role of oxygen concentrations on the release and storage of phosphorus using solid state 31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and P-edge X-ray absorption and fluorescence near edge spectroscopy. The methods will allow them to identify and quantify the different organic and polymeric phosphorus phases in sediments, water column particulates, porewaters and dissolved organic fractions from the Cariaco Basin and Effingham Inlet. In addition, the phosphorus composition and concentrations will be mapped within particulates at scales relevant to microbially-mediated storage and degradation mechanisms. Results will be used to (1) determine whether the presence or absence of oxygen has a marked influence on P speciation and remineralization, and (2) if the microscale structure of phosphorus storage within particulates changes during diagenesis, determine what phosphorus species are preferentially remineralized/released from microsites. <br/><br/>As regards broader impacts, besides significantly improving our understanding of phosphorus cycling in the marine environment, this study will provide support and training for one graduate student from Georgia Institute of Technology and one graduate student and one undergraduate student from the University of South Carolina. It is anticipated that results from this research will be incorporated into local middle school demonstrations and a program called ScienceQuest coordinated by the PI from the University of South Carolina. At Georgia Institute of Technology, the graduate student will participate in the Student and Teacher Enhancement Partnership (STEP) that aims to improve earth science education at local middle and/or high schools."

There is little agreement, however, in this debate over how alternative redistricting plans should be evaluated from the perspective of promoting the interests of voters. At its most fundamental level, the relevant question is: how should legislatures represent different groups of voters, and how should voters be allocated across districts in order to implement this prescription? This project develops an approach based upon traditional welfare economics in order to address this question and related questions from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. <br/><br/>As a normative benchmark, the principal investigators begin by examining how ideological groups should be represented in legislatures. The key findings are that the seats-votes curve, which relates the fraction of seats held by the leftist party to its national support, should be linear, have a positive slope, and be biased in favor of the dominant party. They then examine how voters should be allocated across districts in order to implement this optimal seats-votes curve. The key findings here are that, if the optimal seats-votes curve can be implemented, then districts should be heterogeneous in their allocation of voter ideologies and that some districts should be ""safe seats"". Finally, the project will develop conditions under which the optimal seats-votes curve can be implemented and then tackle the difficult question of how voters should be allocated across districts when these conditions are not satisfied. <br/><br/>The research team will also develop an integrated theoretical and empirical approach to evaluating legislative redistricting from this welfare perspective. It first develops a methodology for estimating seats-votes curves; this methodology requires only data on district-by-district support for the leftist party in legislative elections. The researchers then demonstrate that voter welfare can be directly measured for this observed seats-votes curve as well as for any other possible seats-votes curve. Thus, observed voter welfare can be compared with voter welfare under the optimal seats-votes curve, permitting measurement of any welfare losses from sub-optimal redistricting. In addition, observed voter welfare can be compared with voter welfare under proportional representation, an alternative voting system commonly used in other countries. The methodology also permits a comparison of voter welfare under alternative redistricting regimes, including bipartisan, partisan, and independent commissions. Finally, these ideas are illustrated in an application to voting in U.S. state legislative elections. <br/><br/>The third project aims to generalize the ideas developed in the first two parts to a framework in which both voters and candidates are defined by their ideology as well as by their race. This generalized framework will be used address several normative questions related to race in redistricting. For example, how should black voters be represented in legislatures and allocated across districts? While black majority districts tend to elect black candidates, they also concentrate liberal voters, potentially leading to the defeat of leftist candidates in other districts. Thus, we plan to examine this and other potentially interesting interactions between race and ideology."

Vlachos, Virginia Polytechnic Institute<br/><br/>This grant is to develop a unique instrumentation system for spatially resolved, simultaneous velocity and particle size measurements in polydispersed multi-phase flows with kHz temporal resolution. The system will be used in biofluid mechanics, environmental hydraulics, and turbomachinery flows. These seemingly unrelated areas of fluid mechanics share the fundamental need to address unanswered questions relating the fluid motion along with the motion of polydispersed particulates in anisotropic flows that are governed by turbulence or unsteadiness encompassing a wide range of flow scales and structures. Existing instrumentation fails to deliver spatio-temporally resolved measurements with sufficient sampling frequency to capture turbulent fluctuations while simultaneously measuring the particulate size and size distribution. The new Time Resolved Digital Particle Image Velocimeter (TRDPIV) instrumentation will deliver hardware and algorithm advancements to overcome the experimental challenges present in polydispersed multiphase flow measurements. The new system combines the advantages of conventional DPIV to spatially resolve a flow with the advantages of Laser Doppler Velocimetry or hot-wires to measure high frequency velocity fluctuations and the advantages of Phase Doppler Particle Anemometry to measure particle sizes. The instrumentation developed under this grant will have a direct and broad impact upon the experimental fluid mechanics community. Multi-phase flows such as particle transport and collision, coagulation, flotation, spray atomization and bubble dynamics are present in a wide variety of industries such as chemical, aeronautical/aerospace, naval, power generation, automotive and biomedical. A new unique measurement capability will be available to researchers and engineers in all these areas thus having an indirect yet very broad impact on the nation's industrial, and research infrastructure. Broad and direct impact on diversity will be achieved through well-focused efforts to promote undergraduate and graduate research in recruiting underrepresented women and minorities. Educational impact will be achieved through thorough training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students that will be developing and using the proposed system. The broader educational impacts will extend to the graduate and undergraduate classrooms where the system will be used for teaching advanced experimental methods and performing demonstrations in our required fluid mechanics courses."

The work also includes measuring fiber orientations with micro-CT imaging techniques and developing a computational approach for generating fiber samples numerically from polymer melt flow simulation results. As part of this research, a Monte Carlo simulation procedure will be used to assess the statistical nature of the predicted properties, and the simulation methodology will be demonstrated on industrially-relevant products.<br/><br/>Fiber reinforced polymer composites are the material of choice in numerous engineering applications, due in part to their superior strength to weight ratio. This is especially true for long and short fiber composite products, which also benefit from extremely versatile manufacturing methods such as injection molding. As a result, there continues to be a major effort to incorporate more fiber reinforced polymers in commercial products, particularly in the US automotive industry where future vehicles must have reduced weight, emissions, and fuel consumption. Indeed, a specific objective of the 2010 FreedomCAR program at the US Department of Energy, a co-sponsor and collaborator of this research, is to reduce the weight of an automotive structure by 50 percent for the same cost and durability as seen in today's products. Their aggressive goal is supported under this research project by its focus on a critical link between a fiber reinforced polymer product and its manufacturing process. The research also includes the development of educational visualization tools that will provide a clearer understanding of fiber suspension mechanics for future engineering students."

A taxonomic revision of west-Tethyan bivalves, which will involve<br/>extensive institutional-based research at major European repositories, has never been<br/>attempted and is long overdue. Paleoecologic analyses will entail bed-by-bed analyses of<br/>boundary intervals in which abundance, diversity, and trophic data will be collected from<br/>statistically large samples combined with taphonomic and sedimentologic data within a<br/>high-resolution biochronologic and chemostratigraphic framework. This work will<br/>involve substantial new collaborations with scientists from Italy, Austria and The<br/>Netherlands with expertise in micropaleontology, palynology, stable isotope<br/>geochemistry and regional geology, The research will also actively involve<br/>undergraduate students, both as assistants and as independent researchers and provide for<br/>their training and preparation for future graduate studies. The work proposed here will<br/>have broad significance for the interpretation of biotic patterns surrounding the end-<br/>Triassic mass extinction. The expected outcome of a revised taxonomy of<br/>Rhaetian/Hettangian bivalves of the Kossen Basin will, after more than 100 years, finally<br/>provide sound base-line taxonomic data from which to test hypotheses surrounding the<br/>timing, magnitude, and mode of the end-Triassic extinction."

The principal investigator for the project is William Singhose at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. The Japanese collaborator is Saburo Matunaga at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. They will be undertaking research on an experimental evaluation of coordinated flexible satellite control. The precise control of spacecraft with flexible appendages is extremely difficult. The complexity of this task is magnified many times when several flexible spacecraft must be controlled precisely and collaboratively as in formation flying. Coordinated satellite control requires a group of spacecraft to fly in a desired trajectory while maintaining relative position and velocity with respect to each other. The Two-Dimensional Spacecraft Dynamics Simulator at the Tokyo Institute of Technology was constructed to verify the Robot Satellite Cluster Systems. The two objectives of the project are to: 1) evaluate vibration reducing on-off thruster profiles for three coordinated satellites and 2) evaluate vibration reducing on-off thruster profiles for three coordinated satellites that are connected by tethers. <br/><br/>The project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The collaboration will offer great mutual benefits and could advance the research field in three ways: 1) experimental verification of the proposed satellite thruster control method will enable a significant advancement in satellite control system design; 2) the extension to multiple, coordinated spacecraft will greatly expand the utility of the on-off thruster control methods developed previously for single, independent spacecraft and 3) satellites equipped with on-off thrusters will be able to maneuver faster, more accurately, and with less residual vibration. The project advances international human resources through the participation of a graduate student. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. Results of the research will be disseminated at scientific meetings and in scientific journals."

First, the project documents, analyzes, and compares the changing memories of the discovery as publicly conveyed at anniversaries of DNA structure over time, i.e. from the small size, science dominated 21st anniversary in 1974, to the medium size, policy dominated 40th anniversary in 1993, and the large scale, global society dominated50th anniversary in 2003. The project seeks to explain the changing memories of this discovery over time, during the last half a century, as a function of: 1) The shifting scientific frontier in molecular biology; 2) The changing interface between science and society as a result of the major social impact of molecular biology's applications in the biotech industry and the Human Genome projects; 3) Cultural change, or a growing sensitivity to issues of gender, race, and<br/>power disparities in both science and society, with special attention given to US, UK, and EU. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposal pertains to its ability to shed light on the complex formation of collective memory in science in the second half of the 20th Century, while further clarifying the relationship between the changing collective memory of the discovery of DNA structure, its history, and the public policy related to DNA research. The project also clarifies the role of scientists, science writers/ educators/ policy analysts, artists, cultural critics, and historians, in shaping how a scientific discovery should be remembered and represented two generations later.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposal derives from its plan to construct an interactive website, so as to effectively disseminate a comprehensive study of history, memory and<br/>commemorative practices in science, a new topic that illuminates the origins and impact of scientific discoveries at the dawn of the 21st Century. Providing online access to newly<br/>available documents, visual/ audio interviews, as well as stimulating public debate on the role of history and memory in science will enable scientists, educators, and policy analysts toenrich their agendas by including lessons from detailed historical case studies."

A potentially exacerbating factor to P-limitation is the presence of arsenate (AsO4=), an analog of phosphate (PO4=), that is present in relatively constant concentrations in these systems. As phosphate concentrations decline, the As:P increases, potentially making it difficult for phytoplankton and bacteria to acquire sufficient P required for growth. One mechanism used by phytoplankton to cope with As is the reduction of arsenate to arsenite and methylation to monomethyl and dimethyl arsenic. Under P stress or limitation, the differing abilities of phytoplankton species to detoxify As (arsenic stress) may influence the structure of the autotrophic community, as has been demonstrated in coastal waters. Thus, older paradigms of simple nutrient limitation control of primary production and autotrophic communities may need to be replaced by more intricate paradigms where non-essential, but bioactive, elements such as As may also be shown to profoundly influence autotrophic communities. <br/><br/>To define the linkage between the biogeochemistry of these two elements, and the role of As (and interactions with P) in the regulation of autotrophic communities in oceanic waters, scientists from the Smithsonian Institution and the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography will conduct a series of laboratory experiments using cultured isolates. The exact chemical and biological conditions and rates under which arsenite and methyl arsenic are produced, and their subsequent degradation rates and mechanisms, will be quantified to calculate their residence times, and hence periods of P stress integration. This research will also explore development of arsenite and methyl arsenic as tracers of phosphorus stress or limitation on a variety of temporal and spatial scales. A suite of cultured isolates representing several important members of the phytoplankton community (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, larger eukaryotes) will be tested for resistance to As as a function of the As/P/N ratio. These cultures will be kept very dilute, with low nutrient concentrations, so growth of each species will be followed using flow cytometry. Another aim of this study is to confirm the hypothesis that cyanobacteria are more resistant to high As:P ratios than eukaryotic species. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the research include fostering improved understanding of a potentially crucial factor, As, that phytoplankton and bacteria in large sectors of the open ocean must contend with to acquire a limiting nutrient, phosphorus. Additionally, the PIs will mentor minority undergraduate students and train graduate students in the latest techniques in culturing delicate marine plankton."

While a great deal is known about the causes and consequences of such attitudes, very little is known about the specific cognitive processes underlying implicit attitude judgments. The major aim of this research is to model the cognitive mechanisms underlying one of the most widely used paradigms to test implicit attitudes: the implicit associations test (IAT: Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). Since its development six years ago, there have been over 100 articles published using the IAT to test a variety of implicit attitudes. Despite its popularity, the meaning of IAT scores remains controversial. Little is known about the cognitive processes driving implicit attitudes, and even less is known about what exactly the IAT in particular assesses. In order to map the cognitive processes underlying the IAT, this project will employ a model that makes explicit assumptions about processing, and explicit quantitative predictions: the diffusion model (e.g., Ratcliff, 1978; Ratcliff & Rouder, 1998). The diffusion model is a model of decision making in tasks wherein participants make fast binary choices (like in the IAT). Explicit models of fast decision making can reveal a number of interesting alternative explanations for decision processes that could illuminate our understanding of tasks that intend to measure implicit attitudes. In a series of IAT studies, different factors of the IAT will be manipulated in order to test different possible cognitive processes underlying IAT effects. To do this, a standard IAT procedure will be employed, and various factors within this paradigm will be manipulated to test the model under different conditions. By applying a quantitative modeling tool to the IAT, this research can better reveal the cognitive processes that are at play when a person takes an IAT. In so doing, three goals can be attained: (1) to advance our field's understanding of the cognitive processes used when participating in the IAT; (2) to use the diffusion model to account for IAT data, and to test different versions of the model that are anchored in theories about the locus of IAT effects; and (3) to establish a data set of different parametric manipulations in the IAT so that future researchers can use the IAT more strategically depending on the cognitive processes they wish to explore. <br/><br/>By effectively modeling the IAT, scientists would be better able to use this popular methodology more appropriately and effectively. This is especially urgent given that more and more scientists are interested in exploring intervention applications of the IAT, such as in understanding attitudes related to psychological dysfunctions, consumer behavior, and so on. A better understanding of unconscious contributions to attitudes and behavior could provide greater insight into important social issues, such as attitudes toward racial discrimination."

The proposed multidisciplinary approach optimizes from algorithm specification, to mathematical representation, to software and hardware (FPGA) implementation, based on properties of data and unique requirements of <br/>the environment and the target hardware device. <br/>The novelty of the system is twofold: (1) it performs joint optimization<br/>across mathematical, software and hardware (system-on-a-chip FPGA) domains; and, (2) it is a dynamic, data-driven system in that signal-processing transforms are tailored to algorithm requirements and input signals, for reduced distortion and increased compression, and the system can be queried and steered during execution. Implementations are based on the best mathematical formulation of the problem coupled with automated selection of the best implementation among a space of alternatives, through the integration of models relating mathematical properties to implementation<br/>behavior. Both hardware and software optimization are treated in a unified way. It is anticipated that with these methods the design-time will be decreased by two orders of magnitude or more, compared to implementations derived in a traditional way. Because the proposed system can explore a broad range of implementations that exceed the capabilities of a human designer, the implementations derived by the approach pursued in the project may even exhibit lower resource costs and higher performance.

Since each individual gene locus is only a small part of the whole picture, association studies based on correlating variation at one or a few gene loci to disease outcomes may miss significant larger-scale associations. An attractive alternative that may be more revealing is to base association studies on correlations between disease outcomes<br/>and haplotypes across selected genomic regions, A prerequisite for association studies, whether they are based on a few loci or on larger-scale haplotypes, is an accurate method for haplotype frequency estimation in a given population. The differences between the haplotype frequencies in a healthy population and in a population of<br/>affected individuals may be subtle. Thus, getting an accurate estimate for the haplotype frequencies is extremely important for disease association studies. Estimating haplotype frequencies is a non-trivial task because current sequencing methods may produce noisy or incomplete data and typically yield genotypes, whose resolution into pairs of haplotypes is ambiguous. Existing methods for haplotype frequency estimation are mainly heuristic in nature, and they are only suitable for large samples of unrelated individuals from a homogenous population over short genomic regions. Any deviation from these conditions may result in inaccurate estimates. The main goal of this project is to develop efficient and accurate tools for haplotype frequency estimation under different conditions, and to integrate these methods with novel tools for disease association studies. In particular, the following activities are proposed: develop accurate, efficient and robust methods for haplotype frequency estimation over short and long genomic regions; extend these methods to deal with small sample size and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to population substructure, and incorporate pedigree<br/>information into the haplotype frequency estimator; integrate the resulting tools with a systematic tool for disease association studies that looks for candidate loci automatically using multiple calls to the haplotype frequency estimator; and launch a web server that will allow geneticists to upload their data and run the programs developed in the project on the fly through the web server.<br/><br/>The direct effect of the project would be to reduce the sample size needed for association studies, thus making more studies possible under the same budget constraints. This in turn will lead to a better understanding of complex diseases, which may speed up the search for diagnosis and treatment tools. The mathematical models introduced in this project may shed light on haplotype structure and on evolution. Furthermore, the project will address optimization problems and statistical learning<br/>problems that may be of use beyond the scope of genetics. The diverse tasks of this project include algorithm design and implementation, software integration and biological modeling. Thus, there is a wide range of activities that are suitable for students of all levels.

That significant Fe isotope variations in the rock record extend back to the Archean suggests that the processes which fractionate Fe isotopes at the mineral-microbe interface may record biological Fe cycling back to the early Earth, but these signatures will remain difficult to interpret until Fe isotope fractionations during biological processing are understood at a mechanistic level.<br/><br/>Iron isotope fractionation and exchange during dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) is intimately related to the interface between microbes and ferric Fe minerals, reflecting both redox changes and conditions that allow separation of mobile, isotopically distinct components such as aqueous Fe(II). Experimental work will investigate Fe isotope fractionation among aqueous Fe(II) and Fe(III) and Fe that is sorbed to the mineral surface. Moreover, based on new findings, the role of Fe(III) in the ferric Fe minerals that is open to redox cycling and isotopic exchange will be investigated. Bacteria from the Geobacter and Shewanella groups will be used, in part to contrast production of organic ligands in substrate-isolation experiments. Other variables that will be explored include substrate mineralogy (ferrihydrite, hematite, goethite, lepidocrocite, and ferric Fe clays), and the presence or absence of humic acids. In addition to studying the mechanisms of isotopic exchange and fractionation among the highly reactive pools of Fe(II)aq, Fe(III)aq, Fesorb, and Fe(III) in the substrate during DIR, we will also conduct experiments that produce Fe carbonates and magnetite because these minerals are ubiquitous in the rock record. Importantly, a concentrated effort will be made to explore the isotopic effects of Ca-Mg-Fe compositions in carbonates, given the strong evidence that carbonate stoichiometry plays an important role in Fe isotope fractionations. <br/><br/>In addition to the DIR experiments, abiologic reduction experiments will be done using a variety of pathways to provide a basis for comparison with the effects produced during biological reduction. In many of the experiments, enriched-57Fe tracers will be used, in addition to ""normal"" isotope compositions, to quantify the kinetics of isotope exchange; this information is important for understanding which pathways are likely to proceed under equilibrium conditions and which may not. Finally, two field sites will be studied where biogenic siderite and magnetite are being produced to provide a basis for comparison to the results obtained under controlled laboratory conditions."

Important problems in computer science include sorting and searching, efficient data storage, and data compression. To decide on what is a good method to search out a given item in some database, or a good method for storing music or video with minimal use of memory, it is important to analyze the method or algorithm.

Algorithms that monitor these streams must determine when predictions should change and should calculate such changes if appropriate. Research will also be carried out into the development Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that dynamically adapt to sensor data streams. In addition to building on MDP research, this topic will consider the use of Mixed Integer Programming models for setting MDP parameters. <br/><br/>The results of this research will provide the basis for improved operational control of make-to-order supply chains.

The normal operations decisions supported could include product positioning decisions, order timing and acceptance decisions and production scheduling decisions. The incident response mode will be used to develop a strategy for reacting to major disruptive events. Such events might include the failure or delay of a major supply shipment, a major breakdown in a factory or acceptance of a large order that preempts existing order commitments.

The erythrocyte cytoskeleton membrane is an extraordinary material system that combines a fluidic lipid bilayer with a rubber-like scaffolding protein network to form a flexible membrane that can undergo large deformation. Recent studies on the diseased red blood cells indicate that the membrane structure and the single protein macromolecule behaviors play a critical role in determining the shape and deformability, and thus the physiological functions of red blood cells. However, previous studies on the shape and deformation of cytoskeletal membrane using continuum mechanics neglect the detailed information about the structure of the cytoskeleton membrane. As a consequence, the structure-deformability relationship cannot be established. In the proposed work, a micromechanical modeling framework that is based on the structure of erythrocyte cytoskeleton membrane will be developed. The micromechanically representative volume element will be modeled as a rubbery membrane (skeletal protein network) attached to two membrane layers (the lipid bilayer) via connecting elements (integral proteins). Parametric studies which simulate the structure change of red blood cell under diseased conditions will be conducted to investigate the structure-function relationship of large deformation behavior of erythrocyte cytoskeleton membrane. The proposed research will inspire new concepts for developing a structure based constitutive model to describe the large deformation behavior of red blood cells, and will greatly assist the exploration of the molecular mechanism of red blood cell deformations under diseased conditions. The methodology of combining nanomechanics with the new knowledge in life science is expected to bring in new insight into the miracle of life and eventually result in revolutionary new therapy and improvement of human health. In addition, the proposed work, together with proposed education plans, will enhance higher education in nanotechnology and biotechnology and will inspire young scientists and engineers to develop their careers in this exciting field."

Although lots of progress has been made in connecting String Theories and Supersymmetric Gauge theories to the Standard Model of Strong, Electromagnetic and Weak Interactions, as well as to big bang cosmology, new insights will be needed to make this connection stronger so that String Theory and Supersymmetry can be tested in the laboratory and observatory. This proposal is to foster serious international collaborations between the very strong string theory group at the University of Chicago, with some of the premier groups in Europe, Israel, and India. The subjects that will be investigated are at the very forefront of ideas on how to better understand Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and relate them to the Standard Model. Also of great importance is understanding Black Hole Entropy and how big-bang cosmology can emerge from string theory and brane-world physics. The PI's and collaborators have been leaders in the past few years in making progress in these areas, and by improving the mechanism for international collaboration that this grant will provide, one can expect an increase in the progress in these very important areas. The international collaboration will lead to new ways of looking at the problems confronting String Theory by having diverse talents and perspectives taking a fresh look at the issues.

If such undercounts are not adjusted for, a misrepresentation of the population results. This has led to the development of multiple system surveys, often called capture-recapture surveys. Estimation for such surveys requires a number of restrictive assumptions on unobserved characteristics of the population being studied, and it is of interest to develop estimation and inference methods that are less sensitive to those assumptions. This project intends to relax several of these fundamental assumptions with a unified nonparametric framework based on the kernel regression estimator. A novel nonparametric estimator of the capture probability will be developed that admits both continuous and categorical variables, and can be used in an unequal-probability survey context. This estimator then will be applied in several areas of population size estimation, including in the adjustment of existing population estimators, the correction for frame errors, and in model and assumption checking.<br/><br/>Estimating the magnitude of a population is an important goal of many surveys, including national censuses, surveys of special populations, and many wildlife studies. A large and important application is the U.S. Decennial Census, which is designed to provide accurate counts on the total and subtotal of various groups of the U.S. population. Population size estimates from such censuses and studies are all subject to potential undercount and, more rarely, overcount. For example, analysis of U.S. Census data shows that certain sections of the U.S. population are much harder to enumerate than the rest of the population. The goal of this research is to produce robust and efficient population size estimators that adjust for the presence of undercounts and other types of survey errors, and are appropriate for a wide range of survey settings. By combining methods from several areas of statistics, this research ultimately will contribute to the development of new statistical methodology that is directly relevant to on-going work at federal statistical agencies. The research is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology."

The proposed research capitalizes on unique science we recently developed, substantially extends the effort in new and ground breaking directions, and explores entirely new topics; all require new talents, new skills and new senior investigators.<br/>"

Today, only a small percentage of ships entering U.S. ports have their cargoes inspected. The purpose of this study is to develop decision support algorithms that will help us to optimally intercept illicit materials and weapons and to test the algorithms on real data arising from port-of-entry inspection. The algorithms sought will find inspection schemes that minimize total cost, including ""cost"" of false positives and false negatives. <br/><br/>Imagine a stream of entities arriving at a port and a decision maker having to decide how to inspect them, which to subject to further inspection and which to allow to pass through with only minimal levels of inspection. This is a complex sequential decision making problem. The ultimate goal of an inspection scheme is to classify an entity into important categories and states. In the simplest case, there are two categories (""ok"" and ""suspicious"") and two states (""present"" or ""absent""). This classification can be described as involving a boolean decision function. Different binary tree representations for a boolean decision function have different inspection costs associated with them and an optimal decision tree representation is sought. Modeling sensors used to test for attributes makes the problem more realistic and brings in possible inspection errors and false positives and negatives. Extending the problem to more than two categories and more than two states also makes the problem more realistic.<br/><br/>The project will be carried out in collaboration between a university team and a team from the Los Alamos National Laboratory and will initially follow an approach pioneered at Los Alamos. Four graduate<br/>students will be key participants in the project and many others will be involved through associated public events. The topic lends itself well to undergraduate research and participating faculty will coordinate topics with an existing undergraduate research program that caters to students from all over the U.S. To broaden the impact of the project, a seminar series will be publicized to neighboring institutions and a public workshop will be held. The workshop will include talks of an expository/tutorial nature, making it appealing to<br/>non-specialists and students. A project website and a project book will help to disseminate project results and ideas widely."

The CARIACO site is situated in the tropics on a productive continental margin off Venezuela, the basin is anoxic, and the site is strongly connected to paleoclimate investigations. Thus, CARIACO has the additional goal of relating modern oceanographic processes with the production, transformation, and preservation of particulate matter in the sediment record. <br/><br/>Zooplankton composition, behavior, and physiological rates are important components of the biological pump. Recent findings from the Cariaco Basin and other regions with pelagic redoxclines (suboxic and anoxic interfaces) suggest that they are active regions of biogeochemical cycling, in which C may be directly transferred from bacterial production to zooplankton grazers. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to determine the vertical and horizontal distributions of zooplankton in relation to the redoxcline during two seasons using discrete-depth net samples and a vertical-profiling laser-line scan camera system. Anaerobic and aerobic respiration and metabolites, excretion, and egestion rates will be experimentally determined for vertical migrators and resident species nearsurface and at suboxic and anoxic depths to determine whether zooplankton differ in their release of metabolic and egested products, due to differences in their metabolism and/or composition of food resources. Grazing experiments, in combination with lipid biomarkers and stable isotopic compositions, will be used to assess in situ diet and long-term feeding history of zooplankton. Fecal pellet composition will be compared with pellets in sediment traps. Time-series zooplankton samples also will be analyzed to obtain temporal information on zooplankton community dynamics and allow a seasonal estimate of the zooplankton contribution to elemental fluxes. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. One of the grand challenges of oceanography is to understand the processes that control the transformation and fate of organic carbon in marine systems. Meeting this challenge is hindered by a lack of basic information about factors that govern the response of biological activity to environmental forcing and climate change. In particular, the role of the marine biosphere in the global carbon cycle remains poorly constrained, in part due to uncertainties about biological controls on the quality and quantity of carbon export. This project will contribute to our knowledge of the role of mesozooplankton in biogeochemical cycles, especially in relation to how processes may be modified in regions with anoxic or suboxic layers and strong redox gradients, and will help to correctly understand the links between water column processes and climate history as recorded in the varved sediments of the Cariaco Basin. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The zooplankton time-series will provide information on patterns of marine biodiversity and ecological interactions from a poorly known region. The CARIACO Program has an ongoing impact in technology transfer and human resource development in Venezuela. This project will help train personnel in Venezuela and will support several graduate students. The lead investigators and students will develop materials on the project for dissemination through the NSF-Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence (COSEE) located at USF."

The system is comprised of a multi-level hierarchical simulation of bat flight based on parameterized features of bat morphology and behavior. The simulation operates at multiple levels of physical approximation and computational speed, and is capable of very rapid solutions but requires input from measurements to ensure fidelity and optimality. This input will be provided in an integrated fashion, drawing from a parallel series of experiments in which several discrete data streams will be generated, including kinematic wing data, wake velocity data over a series of two dimensional cutting planes, as well as other data such as bone deformation,experimentally-determined material properties, etc. This data will direct the simulation ensuring accurate solutions, but still with high responsiveness. The data streams will be monitored, synthesized, combined and processed using an advanced immersive visualization environment which will be used to guide the interactions between the measurement and simulation and to organize the disparate streams of data. The simulation environment to be developed is the first such system capable of generating timely solutions of complex flows over highly unsteady and deformable structures. This has multiple scientific and engineering benefits ranging from the ability to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology to the design of bio-mimetic structures that draw from the abilities of bats on the wing. The direction provided by the experiment will guide scientists to the key sensitivities of these complex flying systems and provide insight to the complexities of animal flight mechanics. Lastly, the visualization systems will provide a unique tool for the synthesis and management of dynamic data drawn from a wide and disparate variety of data sources each having different qualities."

Aerosols absorb and scatter solar radiation and thus influence regional and global climate. Though accurate data on aerosol absorption spectra are lacking, the available evidence indicates that aerosols from different sources have markedly different spectra. For example, Saharan dust appears to absorb strongly in the ultraviolet but weakly in the visible part of the spectrum. Diesel soot, on the other hand, absorbs more uniformly over the spectrum. To now, no instrument has been available to measure the in-situ absorption of aerosols at more than two wavelengths, though what is needed for radiative transfer calculations is a detailed representation of the absorption spectrum. Accordingly, a multi-wavelength unit will be built, based on the resonant photoacoustic principle, to measure the absorption at six wavelengths spanning the spectrum from the ultraviolet to the infrared. Calibration is established by measuring the (known) absorption of the 760-nm oxygen A-band. The instrument will be employed for measurements of the spectral absorption of different kinds of natural and anthropogenic aerosols. This information is essential for understanding the consequences of the human use of combustion on climate."

The long-term changes occurring at these colonies are representative of changes throughout the Ross Sea, where 30% of all Adelie penguins reside, and are in some way related to changing climate. The recent grounding of two very large icebergs against Ross and Beaufort islands, with associated increased variability in sea-ice extent, has provided an unparalleled natural experiment affecting wild, interannual swings in colony productivity, foraging effort, philopatry and recruitment. Results of this natural experiment can provide insights into the demography and geographic population structuring of this species, having relevance Antarctic-wide in understanding its future responses to climate change as well as interpreting its amazingly well known Holocene history. This ongoing study will continue to consider the relative importance of resources that constrain or enhance colony growth (nesting habitat, access to food); the aspects of natural history that are affected by exploitative or interference competition among neighboring colonies (breeding success, foraging effort); climatic factors that influence the latter, especially sea ice patterns; and behavioral mechanisms that influence colony growth as a function of initial size and location (emigration, immigration). An increased effort will focus on understanding factors that affect over-winter survival. The hypothesis is that the age structure of Cape Crozier has changed over the past thirty years and no longer reflects the smaller colonies nearby. Based on recent analyses, it appears that the Ross Island penguins winter in a narrow band of sea ice north of the Antarctic Circle (where daylight persists) and south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (where food abounds). More extensive winter ice takes the penguins north of that boundary where they incur higher mortality. Thus, where a penguin winters may be due to the timing of its post-breeding departure (which differs among colonies), which affects where it first encounters sea ice on which to molt and where it will be transported by the growing ice field. Foraging effort and interference competition for food suggested as factors driving the geographic structuring of colonies. The research includes a census of known-age penguins, studies of foraging effort and overlap among colonies; and identification of the location of molting and wintering areas. Information will be related to sea-ice conditions as quantified by satellite images. Demographic and foraging-effort models will be used to synthesize results. The iceberg natural experiment is an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the demographics of a polar seabird and its response to climate change. The marked, interannual variability in apparent philopatry, with concrete data being collected on its causes, is a condition rarely encountered among studies of vertebrates. Broader impacts include collaborating with New Zealand and Italian researchers, involving high school teachers and students in the fieldwork and continuing a website to highlight results to both scientists and the general public."

This new methodology is fundamentally different from the current practice whose performance is limited due to the non-dynamic and non-robust nature in the modeling approaches and in the data collection and processing strategies. This framework consists of two robust data pre-processing modules for highlighting fault features and removing sensor anomaly, three interrelated, multi-level models that describe different details of the system behaviors, and one dynamic strategy for the robust local interrogation that allows for measurements to be adaptively taken according to specific physical conditions and the associated risk level. It incorporates both historical data and on-line signals into the system modeling, and enables the ability to adaptively alter data collection procedures to best capture the critical system features. Collectively, these components lead to a robust and sensitive diagnosis system for wind turbines. This research is strengthened by a close collaboration with industry that will provide abundant historical sensor data and detailed system characterization, and also offer in-field implementation opportunities. <br/>The proposed research will have strategic importance on the utilization of wind energy that is currently the most viable clean energy alternative. Today, in the vast areas that have low wind speed, wind energy cannot compete with traditional energy sources as it has a higher cost, mainly owing to its high maintenance costs and low confidence in the diagnosis technology. This dynamic and data-driven fault diagnosis will play a key role in enabling a cost-effective generation of wind electricity. Progress in the fault diagnosis of blades and gearboxes will also benefit the power generation, automobile, aerospace, and engine industries. Meanwhile, the collaborative nature of this research will provide students with a multidisciplinary training and will bring industrial perspective to the universities. This project will have a long-term impact on education through the curriculum development and will promote the public awareness of clean energy concept through outreaches to high schools."

Specific questions to be examined are as follows: What structural design modifications can be made to ease the repair of distribution and transmission systems? Are certain structural components more prone to wind-induced damage than others? Will specific modifications to the structural redundancy of critical junctions in the lifeline network ensure significant hurricane hardening of the system? How does this hurricane damage (Katrina) differ from other events? What are the similarities and differences of damage caused by different long-term wind events such as ice storms? Examination of the data at the home institution includes a consideration of any spatially related parameters such as network fragilities and outage duration distribution analysis."

There is an outstanding record for paleoclimates and paleoenvironments for this time slice in western Eurasia, but little is known for the contemporary African record where modern humans evolved. This project will jump-start the development in Africa of a detailed paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental record with a multidisciplinary and international project tightly integrated between researchers grounded by the same problem orientation focused on the south coast of South Africa, a region critical to our understanding of the origins of modern humans.<br/>The Scientific Merit of this project is high as it will provide information on both very specific scientific questions about our origins and inform us on broad relationships between global climate change and terrestrial vegetation systems. The project will document the relation between global climate change and its regional expression in southern Africa and the Southern Hemisphere. This will enhance our understanding of modern human origins by furthering our knowledge of the ecological context. It will be one of the few projects in the Southern Hemisphere to study over a long period of time the response of regional floral systems to global climate change as reflected in the ice and deep sea cores, furthering our understanding of how the Southern Hemisphere might respond to potential long term changes in climate. <br/>A novel aspect will be the tight integration of the continental, marine, and atmospheric records with the archaeological and geological record in a restricted region. The typical model for studies such as this is more disciplinarily isolated: studies of dunes, speleothems, isotopes on archaeological shellfish, etc., conducted separately. Cross-disciplinary comparisons and correlations then occur, if at all, by serendipity. A more powerful model is to conduct these studies in concert so that comparisons and correlations occur in real-time, allowing a more synergistic process and holistic result that exploits the natural trans-disciplinary nature of the empirical record. We hope to illuminate a new model of integrated paleoanthropological, paleoclimatic, and paleoenvironmental research with this project. <br/>The project will have significant Broader Impacts. The scientific personnel are an international consortium of faculty and students with a constellation of specialties and laboratory facilities not present at any single institution, enhancing international contacts and cooperation between foreign and domestic institutions. Numerous graduate and undergraduate students from the USA and other countries will participate and receive training in this project. Many of the US students will travel to South Africa to gain field and laboratory experience, and this will also broaden their understanding of South Africa, a nation state that is likely to be key to the economic develop of the entire African continent. <br/>Results of the project will be communicated to the general public through the Institute of Human Origins award-winning website on human evolution (BecomingHuman.com). The web site will be expanded with a focus on climate change and human evolution, what this tells us about humanity's future in light of potential future climate change, and communicate to the public the importance of interdisciplinary research as illustrated by this project."

Scott<br/><br/>Institution: University of California-Santa Barbara<br/><br/>Analysis (rationale for decision):<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to solve a longstanding and complex problem related to a class of catalysts based on chromium that have been extensively used for high-density polyethylene production. These catalysts have a remarkable ability to self-activate in the presence of olefin. Until the nature of the active sites is known, however, it is unlikely that it will be possible to determine how they are formed or why this catalyst is so effective at reviving deactivated sites. The proposed approach to this problem combines active site deconvolution for the heterogeneous catalyst using Flory analysis and kinetic modeling with synthesis of individual active site candidates using surface organometallic chemistry. Matching the activity profiles and polymer characteristics of the catalyst sites with those of well-defined organometallic sites will allow correlation of structure with reactivity. It may then be possible to reformulate the olefin polymerization catalysts by selecting combinations of sites that generate desired combinations of physical properties in the polyethylene. Furthermore, by shedding light on the activation mechanisms of the supported metal oxide catalysts, it will be possible to make the self-activation more efficient. The synthetic approach to active site investigation is complementary to combinatorial approaches to catalyst discovery. Once interesting catalyst formulations are identified and optimized by screening (parallel or otherwise), further improvements depend on the ability to manipulate active site structure. Identifying the structural features which control reactivity by synthesizing model compounds has been a promising strategy in homogeneous catalysis, and the approach is innovative and high risk for heterogeneous catalysis.<br/><br/>The broader technological impacts of this project will be significant due to the widespread use of chromium-based polymerization catalysts by industry. The project will involve students in a very strong multidisciplinary environment that particularly emphasizes the key combination of chemical engineering and chemistry approaches that have been necessary for leading-edge catalysis research. The research program conducted by the principal investigator has a record of involving undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in research: 28 students including 18 women have been involved in projects during the past 10 years, and 13 of these students have pursued graduate studies."

Our intuitions notwithstanding, we know surprisingly little about how to define visual clutter scientifically. We can judge it subjectively, but the problem of formulating an explicit definition has gone unsolved. <br/><br/>With NSF funding, Dr. Rosenholtz is using what we know about visual perceptual systems to develop a mathematical model that can estimate the degree of clutter in a visual display. The model is based on the simple notion that clutter begins when it becomes difficult to add items to a display without degrading performance. There is a counterintuitive consequence to this idea, which is that clutter is not a simple function of the total number of items. Instead, clutter is due to the complex interplay of a number of items with other factors such as item arrangement, shape, and color. The model will be tested against measures of clutter as perceived by human observers, in the context of a variety of visual displays. The measures include subject judgments as well as a number of established human performance metrics. The results of these experiments will advance our understanding of how visual scenes are perceived, and these advances may help with efforts to reduce clutter in displays where such efforts are helpful if not critical."

Preference models determine which one of several plans to prefer. It is important that planners use the same preference models as human decision makers because planners should make the same decisions as their human users, otherwise the planners are not of much use. The PI will investigate how to build planners that fit the preference models of human decision makers better than current planners, by combining constructive methods from artificial intelligence with more descriptive methods from utility theory in order to take advantage of the strengths of the two decision-making disciplines and to extend the applicability of Al planners. The PI will study optimal vs. good or near-optimal (""satisficing"") planning with a variety of preference models. He win explore how to exploit the structure of complex sequential planning tasks to solve them efficiently for realistic preference models suggested by utility theory, with an emphasis on preference models in high-stakes decision situations. To this end, he will focus on representation changes that make use of existing planners from AI by transforming planning tasks with nonlinear utility functions into others that these planning methods can solve, and will study the errors that result for the original planning task when satisficing planning methods are used instead. The research will be performed in the context of managing environmental crisis situations, such as cleaning-up marine oil-spills."

QMC is one among the most precise known techniques to study realistic materials in physics and chemistry and provide a significant gain in precision compared traditional density functional theory (DFT) approaches. This will bring electronic structure quantum Monte Carlo methodology to a qualitatively higher level of applicability to complex materials and lead to increased accuracy. The new QMC techniques will be applied to forefront problems in the properties of Earth materials in order to obtain accurate equations of state, phase transitions, and elasticity of solid materials that are of high interest in geophysics. One significant limitation of today's QMC methods is the high computational demand, which currently makes applications to larger systems including solid solutions prohibitively expensive. A substantial portion of the QMC computation is spent on forming and evaluating a Slater determinant, which is constructed from one-particle orbitals. The team plans to develop and apply different localization transformations in order to obtain a sparse determinant. Two linear algebra methods will be developed for their efficient evaluation. First, Krylov's method for the iterative evaluation of a determinant will be incorporated into QMC. Secondly, the trace of the determinant will be calculated with Monte Carlo methods. Both techniques will further the goal of obtaining an order-N QMC techniques that are more efficient and applicable to a wider range of materials, well beyond the current possibilities.<br/><br/>Computational mineral physics is part of the large effort to use computer simulations to predict and understand properties of the Earth. New mathematical techniques will be derived to make advance quantum Monte Carlo simulations more precise and significantly more efficient. The properties of important Earth materials at high pressure will be predicted with unprecedented accuracy. This work will also lead to a more precise description of a number of fundamental phase transitions in solid deep Earth. This project is a close collaboration between a mathematician, mathematical physicists, and geophysicists. It will bring new applied math methods into geoscience, with broad applicability to all Earth materials. The broader impact will include the development of new computational techniques applicable to many areas as well as the education of graduate students and post-docs in state-of-the-art materials simulations, teaching of new computational techniques in graduate level classes and during two workshops that will be organized.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

From Network Exchange Theory (NET), experiments have been completed to show that high-power central actors reap maximal benefits at exchange and low-power peripherals get minimal rewards. At issue for this research is whether low power actors will act to form coalitions and oppose the power exercised over them and, if so, with what effectiveness. Legitimacy Theory (LT) argues that group members are more likely to take actions that are collectively legitimized. When applied to exchange network processes, LT implies that low power actors are more likely to initiate coalition activity, to actually form coalitions, and to act effectively in them when coalition formation has been legitimized. The current experiments will study the effects of legitimacy by endorsement. In LT, endorsement refers to the approval or support that low power actors give to various elements of social situations including actors, positions or roles, behaviors and the rules that link actors, roles and behaviors. In this experimental study, subjects will complete a series of negotiations and exchanges in two-part. In Part 1, subjects negotiate exchanges independently. No one is given the opportunity to form a coalition. Joint application of NET and LT implies that subjects are most likely to initiate coalition formation and to actually form coalitions in the High Endorsement treatment and least likely to do so in the Low Endorsement condition with the control condition falling between. Coalitions are expected to be more stable (i.e., members are less likely to defect) and more effective in the High Endorsement condition and least stable and least effective in the Low Endorsement condition. A coalition's effectiveness is measured by the extent of its success in countervailing power. The two-structure design permits observation of size effects on coalition formation, stability and effectiveness, and permits tests of more than 20 additional theoretical predictions.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACT<br/>The theory of collective action offers a quite gloomy picture for the prospects of acting collectively. Nevertheless, collective actions do succeed and, when they do, often that theory is silent. Do they succeed at times because of the effects of legitimacy? This research will answer that question. The research will enhance sociology's infrastructure by adding its coalition designs to the Web-Lab housed at the University of South Carolina (weblab.moore.sc.edu). Like all Web-Lab designs, researchers at any location in the U.S. or elsewhere will be able to access these. The USC laboratory contributes to research-based learning, offering undergraduate and graduate classes using the Web-Lab. Designs used in this research will importantly enhance that course work. The USC laboratory also enhances diversity among student researchers. Currently, the majority of student researchers are women and, in a typical year, 20% of student researchers are African-American."

The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.<br/><br/>The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled ""Discovering the recognition code bacteria use to sense their environment by tracking co-evolutionary patterns.""  Bacteria posses multiple two-component  signaling pathways that are responsible for adaptive change due to environmental stimuli. The phospho-transfer central to this process requires precise protein docking, while the presence of multiple pathways requires that the structurally similar signaling pairs only dock with their cognate partners.  By studying co-evolutionary patterns in over 1000 functional pairs, this research investigates how these constraints have been met by nature and then uses this knowledge to construct a tool to enable prediction of unknown functional pairs.<br/><br/>The relevance of the bioinformatic tool will rely on the assimilation of structural data, proteomic data of over 200 sequenced bacterial genomes, and detailed knowledge of the biochemical and biological characteristics of these pathways.  In working with biochemists and biologists at the host lab, the Fellow is gaining a perspective that will enrich his ability to contribute to working biologists from an informatics perspective and allow him to actively participate in the synthesis of diverse areas of expertise in the future.<br/>"

There<br/>is a critical need to determine water budgets, to track contaminants moving across the<br/>interface (in either direction), and to understand the influence of groundwater discharge<br/>on surface water habitats. But obstacles remain to making the necessary measurements.<br/>Flux estimates made using mass balance calculations and models do not provide locations<br/>of groundwater discharge and recharge. Point measurements made using seepage meters<br/>or piezometers and sediment K have been plagued by lack of spatial coverage and<br/>reproducibility problems.<br/>This research will map the extent and continuity of groundwater recharge and<br/>discharge zones at two well-documented sites, Lake Lacawac in Pennsylvania and Mirror<br/>Lake in New Hampshire, using a newly-developed marine resistivity system.<br/>Measurements collected by towing the electrodes behind the boat on a floating line can<br/>be combined with GPS and bathymetry data during data inversion to produce nearly<br/>continuous 2-D resistivity profiles. Resistivity responds to variation in porosity, ionic<br/>strength of pore fluids, and clay content. In some cases, changes in pore fluid indicate<br/>groundwater recharge from the lake (outseepage) or discharge to the lake (seepage).<br/>Increase in porosity may indicate likely areas of discharge and increased clay content<br/>may indicate areas of restricted groundwater-surface water interaction. Using the<br/>resistivity system, measurements can be made over larger areas, and compared with the<br/>geology beneath the lake. The geophysical interpretation of potential areas of<br/>groundwater seepage or outseepage will tested by deploying an array of low cost manual<br/>seepage meters, as well as new logging seepage meters that make use of an<br/>electromagnetic flowmeter to detect changes in flow over time. The geophysical surveys<br/>will advance knowledge of groundwater-lake interactions by providing better spatial<br/>coverage, linkages between geologic features and seepage, and more temporal data in<br/>order to examine system response to stresses (both storms and climate change).<br/>This research is important to society because of the increasing pressures on<br/>freshwater resources. Better understanding groundwater-surface water interactions will<br/>improve prediction of water budgets and chemical transfer (i.e., contaminants).<br/>Furthermore, seepage interfaces are often hot spots of biological activity and play an<br/>important role in nutrient and carbon cycling. This study is designed for transfer to other<br/>sites because it looks at the fundamental relationships between the geophysical signal(s)<br/>and the observed hydrology.<br/>The educational impact of this research occurs at multiple levels. Funds will be<br/>provided for three masters students during their second year of study. In addition,<br/>undergraduates will act as field assistants and take ownership of research sub-projects. To<br/>further enhance their research experience, funding is included to permit undergraduate<br/>students to attend a scientific conference and present their research. Temple often attracts<br/>first-generation college students and has a 30% minority population; in the geology<br/>department, there is a good gender balance among students. Thus, Temple is able to<br/>reach under-represented groups in the sciences. In addition to university education, the<br/>project will contribute educational materials on the importance of groundwater-lake<br/>interaction for tours at the lakes studied."

Most major practical problems, such as environment, public health and the access to technology, are inherently interdisciplinary and are shared across national boundaries. Internationally, we also face the challenge of transforming higher education itself to become more accessible and more responsive to the needs of our communities. Faculty on this project have been working with models for coupling collaborative multinational research addressing common scientific and engineering challenges to mutual assistance in the reform of our institutions. The essence of this approach is to tap into the rich and vibrant spectrum of international research and service activities, which are at the very heart of faculty interests and enthusiasms, while simultaneously creating opportunities that can be embedded in the core of undergraduate curricula. The current project builds on work to date in this promising arena by creating a small alliance of universities, both within the US and worldwide, which will collaborate on further refining, scaling-up, and institutionalizing this approach to integrating international research, education and service. There are several design features to this multinational project-based strategy. Prioritized projects : 1) Are embedded in genuine faculty research interests on all sides; 2) Can take place within curricular structures that affect large numbers of undergraduate students on all sides, rather than the fortunate few; 3) Contribute to the solution of practical regional problems, and 4) Invoke deep partnerships with other allies, including industry, state and local government, and non-profit organizations. A collaboration on first-year engineering design with Tohoku University, in Sendai, Japan, has been created and is currently in its third year. A four-year collaborative project on environmental challenges facing two regions with Sichuan University, in Chengdu, China has been launched. To further catalyze a fundamental re-formulation of international education and research, this project is supporting two major activities. The first is to help seed the creation of a small alliance of institutions, each of which shares the vision of strategically coupling undergraduate education reform to the solution of complex regional problems. This is particularly important in increasing the range of diversity of institutions that are able to participate. The second is to disseminate the lessons learned by the core group concerning the pragmatics of multinational collaborations that integrate education and research. The Principle Investigator's institution has made a major commitment to the success of this project, including faculty release time, staff support and cash, totaling approximately 50% of the amount requested from the National Science Foundation."

The turbulence measurements were performed using a submersible Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system mounted on a telescopic profiling platform with a 10 m profiling range that can align the sample area in any desired direction. The data consist of time series of instantaneous, 2-D velocity distributions in two independent sample areas. The sample areas are spaced to obtain the Reynolds stresses with minimal wave contamination using structure functions. With varying magnifications, the PIV data resolve length scales ranging between 1.2 mm to 1 m, enabling direct calculation of dissipation rate. Preliminary results from the deployments that motivate the present analysis proposal include evidence of: a) Variations of Reynolds stresses and mean current with wave phase. b) Turbulence production lower than the dissipation rate, and variations of stresses with depth in the outer portions of the bottom boundary layer. The stresses seem to scale with the mean current. c) Turbulent energy spectra that increase in similarity to the universal spectrum with increasing Reynolds number, but still indicate anisotropy at all scales, including the dissipation range. e) At moderate, but typical tidal flows, the production is intermittent, occurring during periods of gusts, while the dissipation changes little.<br/><br/>Proper modeling of oceanic circulation is essential for improvements in predictions of climate, weather and human impact on the coastal ocean.

0516181	An Investigation of the Mechanism Producing Rhythmic Beating in Cilia and Flagella	MCB	Cellular Dynamics and Function	11/01/2005	11/17/2008	Charles Lindemann	MI	Oakland University	Continuing grant	Richard Rodewald	10/31/2010	"$689,382.00"		lindeman@oakland.edu	530 Wilson Hall	Rochester	MI	483094401	2483704116	BIO	1114	"1114, 1132, 7465, 9183, BIOT"	$0.00	"Flagella and cilia are self-contained biological machines (micro in scale in the aggregate but consisting of nanoscale mechanical parts) that convert chemical energy from ATP into useful mechanical work. These are highly conserved eukaryotic organelles that are found in plants, protistans, and animals (including humans).  The general function of flagella and cilia is nearly always to move in a rhythmic fashion (although the nonmotile ""sensory cilia"" represent a notable exception).  These rhythmic movements play important roles in various life processes such as reproduction, embryonic development, and movement of fluids across cell surfaces in contexts as varied as protozoan feeding and mucus clearing in the trachea and bronchi of lungs. We still do not fully understand how this basic component of a living eukaryotic cell works. This project is directed at understanding, at a precise molecular and physical level, how cilia and flagella work. The major goal is to experimentally gather critical physical information about the flagellum and to incorporate it into a theoretical and computational model of flagellar mechanics. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Lindemann has developed a unique set of tools that will aid him in this endeavor.  One such tool is a novel method, based on force-calibrated glass microprobes, for measuring small forces, which enables the measurement of force actively produced by flagella and the passive mechanical stiffness of a flagellum.  This novel methodology permits the acquisition of new and useful information that can be used to describe the mechanical behavior of flagella.   Another tool is a detailed computational model of the mechanics of the axoneme (the mechanostructural component of the flagellum or cilium) that Dr. Lindemann has developed, termed The Geometric Clutch model.  This simulation model has successfully duplicated, and even predicted, the behavior of cilia and flagella.  The computer model provides a framework that can be used to build toward a more complete picture of the mechanics of the axoneme. Dr. Lindemann will use the data from his force measurement experiments to improve the computer model.  When experimental results and computed simulation are in agreement, the model often provides a means to understand the mechanism behind the observed result; in other words, the combination of experimentation and modelling can help us learn how the flagellum works.   <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The goal of the project is to understand how flagella and cilia work.  Therefore, the project will contribute basic scientific knowledge about the living eukaryotic cell. There are very few research programs that are combining computer modeling with laboratory experiments to study the mechanical workings of flagella. The mechanical and physical information obtained from these studies complement the remarkable advances in understanding the flagellum at the molecular level. The Geometric Clutch model allows the physical properties of many specific axoneme structures to be identified with the appropriate molecular components. This has already yielded concrete predictions about properties that the various molecular components, including spokes, the dynein heads and the nexin links, must have in order to be functional in a flagellum.   Dr. Lindemann's research program has a well-established base of experience with mammalian sperm.   He is now developing a computer model specific to the mouse sperm flagellum.  The mouse is one of the primary research model systems and, as such, a large data base is available on the genome and molecular biology of this animal. A working model of the mouse sperm axoneme will position Dr. Lindemann's laboratory as the only research program that can do experimental measurements on mouse sperm and also examine the results in a theoretical framework.  Dr. Lindemann is also embarking on a collaboration with Dr. David Mitchell that will involve the analysis of Dr. Mitchell's remarkable transmission electron micrographs of Chlamydomonas flagella, obtained by  Dr. Mitchell through the use of his innovative methods of rapid fixation and orientation of samples for sectioning.  Again, the large data base of molecular and genetic information about the structure and properties of the flagella of this model unicellular organism will assist in the analysis and interpretation of the images in terms of mechanism.<br/><br/><br/>Broader impacts: Dr. Lindemann's work applies physics and computational modeling to a biological system. It has drawn the interest of people in the mathematics, physics and engineering communities because it is a successful melding of ideas from different disciplines. The flagellum is nature's own micro-machine, built of nanoscale parts.  Despite the extensive knowledge of the biochemistry of the flagellum that is available, it is only by understanding the mechanical properties that we can reach a full understanding of how it works.   This understanding is crucial to the development of biomimetic devices that harness molecular motors to create new functional and useful nano- and micro-machines.  We must observe and learn from nature to build tomorrow's nanotechnology.   Dr. Lindemann has an extensive record of mentoring undergraduate students and introducing them to the principles and practice of laboratory research, and many of the undergraduates are co-authors on scientific reports and upon graduation, advance into careers in science, teaching and medicine.  This project will continue to be a vehicle for this integration of research with teaching and training . <br/><br/>"

Where are most of the atoms in the universe? How do galaxies and their environments affect each other? These questions will be addressed by a detailed study of a 100 square-degree strip of the Southern sky. Our observations will focus on the universe when it was between 2 and 6 billion years old. <br/><br/>The new Southern African Large Telescope (SALT, in South Africa) will be used to make four-color images of the strip. The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT, in Chile) will make microwave maps of this strip. We will identify galaxy clusters in the strip and then use the SALT spectrograph to obtain ages and redshifts for galaxies in the clusters. The Magellan and Blanco telescopes, also based in Chile, will provide additional high-quality imaging data for a gravitational lensing survey, directly probing the distribution of mass in the survey region. By combining our microwave maps with space-based X-ray observations, we will be able to measure the temperature and distribution of gas and compare it to the spatial distribution of galaxies. An integrated analysis and numerical simulation effort will combine all of the data sets and extract constraints on the universe as a whole and on the evolution of galaxies and clusters.<br/><br/>This ambitious program will build strong international collaborations based on the scientific talents of three major US astronomy and physics programs (Princeton, Rutgers, and the University of Pennsylvania) and of two Southern Hemisphere institutions, Catolica University (Chile) and the University of KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa). This novel multi-national effort will provide superb international scientific training for undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and young faculty. Undergraduate students will engage in an 8-week international research experience at one of the two Southern Hemisphere sites. Graduate students will be paired with their peers at other partner institutions and will participate in weekly video and web teleconferences. Semi-annual summer schools and workshops (alternating between hemispheres) will introduce graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to cutting-edge technologies, new scientific results, and different cultures. Students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty from other ACT institutions in the UK, Mexico, and Canada will also participate in the summer school, thus broadening the international collaborative network. Postdoctoral researchers and faculty will also travel to South Africa and Chile to work with their colleagues on data collection, analysis, and synthesis. This project will not only enable an exciting scientific research program but will also train future leaders that are able to prosper in the global scientific environment."

Most of this change will occur over the next 30 years, as 77 million baby boomers cease to work and pay payroll taxes and instead start to retire and collect benefits.""<br/>The growing numbers of elderly individuals in need of supports to live in the community will severely test the current services infrastructure. Part of the answer is to develop technological innovations that allow a sensitive and intelligent augmentation to empower an elder population to successfully ""age in place."" However, it is essential to understand the needs of the target community before encouraging large investments in research leading to exotic, new technologies. Rather, this issue can best be addressed by integrating the knowledge and perspectives of social science, computer science, and in partnership with potential elderly recipients of the technology. Through such an approach, social scientists can best understand the potential of the technology, examine the ways aging clients might use it in their own context, address the learning transition into their effective use, and determine what challenges must be overcome for success. Technologists can provide reconfigurable experimental systems supporting field tests designed to provide empirical data that can be used as dynamic feedback into this analysis. Together,these synergistic activities can provide systems for studying the broader introduction of technology to the aging population. This proposal addresses the concern that those who have been developing assistive technology have not been sufficiently involved at ""ground level"" with the elders themselves or with their families or service systems. In addition, collaboration between social scientists and computer scientists has been rare; yet, social science can tap into the theoretical foundations of behavior and identify those issues which are likely to facilitate and obstruct the introduction of assistive technology to the elderly. Therefore, an interdisciplinary and integrative approach proposed here is essential to a positive outcome.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This proposal brings together social scientists and geriatric social work practitioners from Smith College and computer scientists who have expertise in computer vision, robotics, and human computer interaction from the University of Massachussetts and Mitsubishi Electrical Research Laboratory (MERL). An ecosystemic perspective will be used to study the effective utility of computer based technology for enhancing capacity in the elderly to ""age in place"" or live independently. Many of the issues examined in this study will be informed by the long-standing research tradition of environmental gerontology which examines the impact of physical, social, organizational and cultural environments on aging processes and outcomes. In order to assist the elderly in engaging comfortably with new technology, it is essential to enhance their sense of agency and control and thus promote empowerment; therefore, enhancing a sense of control for the elderly will be a critical element of the way in which technology is introduced. We will also examine the unique cognitive and learning issues for older adults in mastering new technology and will attend, as well, to the ethical issues raised by the introduction of technology. The technologists will provide reconfigurable experimental systems supporting field tests designed to provide empirical findings with respect to the technology. Together, these synergistic activities can provide systems molded to the precise needs and desires of the aging population - systems that are ultimately based on carefully conducted research and trial.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The technological innovations studied and developed here have great potential to reduce depression risk as a result of increased stimulation of cognition, reduction of social isolation, improvement in self care and greater sense of self efficacy, and to significantly improve the quality of care afforded the elderly. The results of this research will guide scientists and engineers in the introduction of technology to the rapidly growing and highly vulnerable population of elderly. We expect it will point the way to significant cost reduction while increasing the quality of care for senior citizens. Furthermore, the lead research team is from an undergraduate women's college that has an elite graduate program for training social workers. It will bring women undergraduates into research contact with Ph.D. and MSW graduate students and faculty and prepare them for the coming technological revolution in elderly care."

The underlying questions are: (i) To what extent are gene regulatory networks modular? (ii) How do modules originate and how do they evolve? (iii) How do extant and emerging criteria for defining modules in networks affect our ability to predict biological function? The project has integrated computational and experimental components, and the project team consists of experts in molecular biology, genetics, computational science, mathematics, and physics. On the computational side, the project will develop and evaluate new algorithms for module detection, and will use these algorithms to predict modules in budding yeast from both existing and project-generated genomics data. On the experimental side, a high-level, causal interaction map of gene function in budding yeast will be generated. This will be done by systematically screening for individual genes that, when overexpressed, suppress the deleterious effects of known mutant genes. The mutant genes and their suppressors will define an interaction map that will be used to define modules and compare with extant maps. Experimental module boundaries, so defined will then be compared with our computational predictions. This test can validate or amend our current understanding of modularity, and will likely raise questions that will extend this understanding. To obtain insight into rules by which entire modules evolve, a related experimental effort will be conducted in Pichia pastoris, a distant evolutionary relative of the budding yeast, in order to study evolutionary changes in module structure. This project is expected to advance our understanding of networks in modern systems biology, provide new insights and data and promote new engineering-inspired ways of thinking about biological function. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Novel research materials, data and software will be openly available to the community at large through our research website. We expect that some of the methods, computational and experimental will be able to be readily extended to more complex eukaryotes. An important component of this project is education and outreach, which will be advanced through a dedicated series of summer workshops for high-school teachers, summer internships for high-school and undergraduate students, and online course material, all focused on integration of physical and biological sciences addressing the evolution of biological complexity. The simple experimental system should lend itself to the development of student experiments that probe the complexity of the yeast network. This project will provide an opportunity for young students to discover complex forces that shape living systems at a fundamental level of organization."

Even the order of magnitude of reef biodiversity is poorly known, yet eutrophication, overfishing, and global warming threaten the very existence of reef ecosystems. Documenting reef biodiversity is thus of the utmost urgency, so that baseline information becomes available about the diversity, distribution, and ecological roles of reef biota, against which future changes can be compared, and management and conservation decisions made. Sea cucumbers are among the most poorly known large marine invertebrates, especially on coral reefs. Yet sea cucumbers are among the most common and diverse large invertebrates on reefs, and a cornerstone of reef detrital food webs. Likely as many species remain undiscovered as have been described. Our knowledge of these striking, large animals lags behind that of many other groups partly because few scientists specialize on them and most that do are near or past retirement age. Large aspidochirotids, the focus of this proposal, are harvested in a multimillion-dollar beche-de-mer industry and sold as a gourmet food item in Asian markets. As Asian economies grow, demand for beche-de-mer is increasing and overfishing is a reality or an imminent threat in much of the tropics.<br/>The objective of this project is to greatly improve our understanding of sea cucumbers through large-scale, collaborative phylogenetic efforts, revisions, and training. Three graduate and several undergraduate students will be trained in modern systematics and pursue research on holothurians. PEET trainees, PIs will work with other holothurian specialists to collaboratively document a large portion of sea cucumber diversity. Three major groups preferentially targeted by fishers (Stichopodidae, Bohadschia and Actinopyga, comprising ca. 110 species) will be revised. A web site will be developed to include a comprehensive database of all aspidochirotids, including copies of all original descriptions and figures, updated synonymies and lassification, species pages, interactive keys, image libraries, GIS maps, and pdfs of the taxonomic literature on sea cucumbers. The group will develop a robust phylogeny of aspidochirotids using molecular and morphological approaches, and explore hypotheses about their evolution, ecology, biogeography, and biology. Phylogenies and revisions will be used to address questions about major biotic transitions (between tropical - temperate, shallow - deep, off reef - reef zones), patterns of marine speciation, and evolution of holothurian morphology and ecology. The phylogenetic approach will also help delineate species complexes and identify geographic limits of stocks. Having a taxonomic understanding of the biota is essential foundation for work on the ecology, conservation, and management of megadiversity ecosystems like coral reefs. Understanding the species-level taxonomy of sea cucumbers will facilitate efforts to manage fisheries, especially as several fished taxa are in unresolved species complexes, and stock limits are poorly understood. The abundant photographic and other documentation will foster attention and study of these animals by divers, naturalists, fisherman, and others."

Closing this gap by providing an order of magnitude increase in processing power will realize the potential of this powerful technique. The new system is based on a Beowulf cluster supercomputer specifically designed to handle and process TRSPIV image data sets of 5.2 Giga Bytes or more. The parallel processing will be completely transparent to the user and will require no knowledge of parallel processing, removing inhibitions about acquiring large samples and allowing the user to concentrate on the experiment. This system will be used in several departments of the College of Engineering at Utah State University and at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). TRSPIV measurements will become accessible to a large segment of the fluid dynamics community. For a modest increase in cost, it will become possible to process the very large samples that time-resolved SPIV generates. Other measurements involving large samples, such as phase-locked measurements in periodic flows (e.g. flow control studies) will also benefit. Experience has shown PIV to be very accessible measurement technique, making this system valuable in the productive undergraduate research program at Utah State. The PIs also plan to use the system for outreach activities with local high schools and under represented groups."

Chemical structures that will have two or more protruding appendages of DNA will be synthesized. These appendages, or arms of molecular ""spiders"", will have the ability to attach to or detach from a position on a surface in response to external stimulus. When a spider arm reattaches to a different position, the spider will move across the surface. The successful construction and description of these autonomously moving molecules will generate both scientific and public interest, and these studies have the potential to lead to applications in areas such as drug delivery and nanopatterning. <br/><br/>Chemical Bonding Centers are designed to focus innovative collaborative efforts that address a ""big problem"" which will lead to a major advance in chemistry or at the interface of chemistry and other sciences and will have the potential to attract broad scientific and public interest."

It is based on the assumption that we know little about how evaluation systems are developed or can be themselves evaluated. This is especially so because of the complexity of evaluation demands given the range of current methods and approaches and contexts of evaluation. What is proposed is to use structured participatory mixed methods system approaches to: identify the needs that STEM educators and evaluators have for evaluation of their programs; develop a formal model of an evaluation system to address those needs; identify the major components of that system and how they might work together; and operationalize one or measures of evaluation capacity building that can be used to assess evaluation system development. The model and measures will be implemented and tested in a pilot project in a New York City that includes both formal and informal STEM education programs. The project is intended to contribute to our fundamental knowledge regarding the nature and structure of evaluation systems, how they can be developed more effectively and how to evaluate their development. By ""evaluation system"" the project means ""an arrangement of various components - values and principles, methods, resources, and structures - designed to conduct and support an evaluation capability"". Usually an evaluation system is a way to support many separate evaluation projects, and often with the express purpose of being able to integrate and compare the results of these distinct evaluations. The project does not claim there are no resources for evaluation. Rather it is that there are too many, or resources varying in quality and not screened or adapted for use in particular contexts. It is a lack not of resources but of systems for supporting evaluation. Thus, the proposed project is designed to: develop a model of STEM evaluation system needs and how they might be addressed; develop one or more measures or evaluation capacity that can be used to assess change efforts; and pilot test a capacity-building effort in two local STEM programs while simultaneously testing the evaluation capacity building assessments developed. Project partners have indicated support including the schools (the Biology Teachers Institute and the informal science Cornell Garden Mosaics project); STEM research groups at Cornell (nanobiotechnology project with education outreach, integrative graduate education and research traineeship project for scientists and engineers, science inquiry partnerships, and environmental inquiry IMD project."

The mission of the American National Election<br/>Studies (ANES) is to inform explanations of election outcomes by providing data that support rich<br/>hypothesis testing, maximize methodological excellence, measure many variables, and promote<br/>comparisons across people, contexts, and time. The ANES serves this mission by providing researchers with a view of the political world through the eyes of ordinary citizens. Such data are critical, because these citizens' actions determine election outcomes. <br/><br/>This research continues the ANES mission for the next four years, but in new and better ways<br/>than ever before. It builds on an ANES history that has made the project a valuable resource to<br/>generations of social scientists. As has been true for every past presidential election in the ANES time<br/>series, a presidential year pre- and post-election study will be conducted using face-to-face interviewing of a nationally representative sample of adults, with an unusually high response rate. This study will include questions specific to the election of 2008 and also questions that augment the ANES time series, which is now in its sixth decade. For the first time, moreover, scholars will be able to purchase interview minutes and additional cases on the time series study to enhance its breadth.<br/><br/>In many other respects, this proposal constitutes a substantial break from the past, outlining new kinds of data collection, new methods for choosing questionnaire items, a new management structure, new organizational procedures to promote the involvement of a broader set of scholars, and a fundamentally different kind of relationship between the ANES and its user community.<br/>One new data collection effort will be a two-year panel study involving six core waves of data<br/>collection with the same respondents, plus 15 additional waves of data collection. The first core wave will be in late 2007, before the primaries; the next three core waves will be spread over the months running up to election day; and the final core waves will be in November and May after the election. Data will also be collected during every other month throughout the life of the panel, but with a focus on matters that are not explicitly political, to minimize selective panel attrition or conditioning driven by interest in politics while producing lots of valuable information on respondents. The panel will allow scholars to study citizen politics in new ways and will illuminate how election year politics affect judgments of the new administration in the formative months of its term.<br/><br/>A second new data collection enterprise involves a partnership with the Ohio State University Center<br/>for Human Resource Research. They conduct the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which has been interviewing a nationally representative panel of adults and their children for decades with breathtakingly long and varied questionnaires. Questions measuring political attitudes and behaviors will be included in these surveys for the first time, allowing the study of developmental and socialization experiences through the life-cycle and across generations.<br/><br/>To help scholars develop and validate new measurement tools for use in the above-listed surveys, an<br/>ANES pilot study will be run in November, 2006, reinterviewing respondents from the 2004 ANES.<br/>The components of this data collection plan each strengthen the others. Alone, each component will<br/>allow a broad range of scholars to evaluate the robustness of old and new theoretical claims. In addition, each endeavor will be designed to facilitate coordinated analysis with all the other data collections. The specifics of the designs of all these studies will be determined by an array of scholars more intellectually diverse than ever before. Its new PIs and Board of Overseers hail from more universities and a broader range of disciplines than any of its predecessors. <br/><br/>This research project includes a new Internet-based procedure for soliciting, processing, reviewing, and providing feedback on proposals for study design elements from anyone who wishes to offer them. All this will be done with an unprecedented transparency to the user community. Because these activities will generate a huge amount of data, detailed plans have been designed outlining how the management of the study design, data collection, and data dissemination processes will be carried out by the experienced technical staff that is already in place. In addition to coordinating the questionnaire design and fieldwork processes, the staff will maintain and update the study's huge and multifaceted website by adding the newly collected data and also dramatically enhancing the study's electronic archives of previously-collected information dating back from the 1940s.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: By generating large, multifaceted datasets of high quality, the ANES will equip researchers to learn new and important lessons about the world of politics. These data will be distributed widely and quickly to serve thousands of scholars and to be used in classrooms around the world to enrich research and education. Americans want to understand how its democracy works. The ANES will help to inform the nation about itself, exploring the causes and consequences of voting behavior and electoral outcomes. With such knowledge, the polity will be better equipped to nurture and refine its system of government."

A broad-scale ""family tree"" (phylogeny, genealogy) will be estimated using DNA sequences from approximately 250 species, representing all 126 families into which Lepidoptera are currently divided. A simultaneous review of known lepidopteran fossils will allow estimation of the geological ages of origin of the major groups. The 24 genes to be sequenced, identified by genome comparisons and screening in an earlier Tree of Life project, constitute far greater sampling of the genome than has heretofore been possible in most insects. Beyond providing a ""backbone"" phylogeny, the project is designed to catalyze a world-wide community effort to further resolve the lepidopteran tree, incorporating more traditional evidence from anatomy and behavior in addition to DNA. Annual lab workshops will help other lepidopterists to apply the numerous genes developed for this project, methods for which will be continuously updated on the web. An international network of >20 experts on Lepidoptera will help to choose species and provide specimens for project DNA sequencing. These experts will also jointly produce the first comprehensive catalog of anatomical features potentially informative about lepidopteran family genealogy, clarifying the chaotic terminology which has frustrated previous attempts to employ these traits for tree-building. A central project feature, also borrowed from modern genomics, will be an interactive website allowing the project team plus any other researcher to contribute and download data, methods, analysis and commentary on lepidopteran phylogeny at any level. The intent is to foster global cooperation and progress toward a fully-resolved tree. The web site will be ""seeded"" with most of the current evidence, to ensure a critical mass of information for others to build on. The same compilations will be used to greatly augment the available resources for public education on Lepidoptera, through contributions to popular web sites such as the Tree of Life.<br/><br/>The Lepidoptera are the largest single group of plant-feeding insects, numbering over 160,000 species. Ubiquitous and familiar, they are both a vital component of terrestrial ecosystems - what would birds and bats eat without them?- and arguably the most damaging group of pests overall to agriculture. As unusually conspicuous terrestrial non-vertebrates, Lepidoptera are extensively used in ecosystem assessment, and for educating and involving the public in environmental biology. They are also important focal organisms in many areas of biological research. For example, the evolutionary diversification of Lepidoptera in association with the rise of flowering plants, beginning in the Age of Dinosaurs, has figured prominently in the attempt to understand the origins of today's biodiversity. A well- corroborated ""family tree"" is essential both for understanding any aspect of lepidopteran evolution, and for constructing classifications that let us effectively organize and apply our voluminous knowledge about individual moth and butterfly species. However, relatively little progress toward such a tree has heretofore been made."

Two opposing theories about why this might be are: <br/>Life first arose in a hydrothermal environment, possibly in the deep subsurface.<br/>Thermophiles preferentially survived the ""late heavy bombardment"" of the Hadean Earth. <br/>Since no sedimentary record survives from this period, it is not possible to address these theories directly through geology. Instead, we must look to modern geomicrobial processes to better understand controls on, and modes of, thermophilic life. Armed with this understanding, geological records may eventually yield more information on the physiological capabilities and nature of early life.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses geomicrobial processes at interfaces between mildly reducing hydrothermal fluids and oxidizing surface sediments or waters. Specifically, we will use a combination of molecular, chemical, and isotopic methods to identify the geomicrobial associations, metabolic strategies, nutrient, and energy requirements and geochemical signatures of streamer and biofilm-forming communities (SBC) of thermophilic and chemolithotrophic Bacteria and Archaea.<br/><br/>We will address the following questions:<br/>1) What is the physiochemical basis for the occurrence of biofilm-forming Aquificales? <br/>2) What is their primary carbon source and mode of carbon assimilation?<br/>3) What are the identities of the Crenarchaeota that appear to co-colonize these systems?<br/>4) Is there a co-dependence of these microbes and, if so, what is its basis?<br/>5) Can biosignatures be used to distinguish thermophilic and mesophilic communities?<br/>6) Might these systems leave a molecular record that could be traced back in time?<br/><br/>Scientific Merit: Through this research, we will learn more about the physiological basis for life at high temperatures and the characteristic biosignatures of thermophilic microbes. In particular, we will seek to discern if there is a symbiosis or simply a physical co-habitation of thermophilic Aquificales and Crenarchaea in the SBCs of Yellowstone National Park. These organisms occupy a special niche at the interface of hot, sub-subsurface hydrothermal fluids and a ""cold"" and oxidizing atmosphere. In seeking to increase understanding of microbes and biogeochemical processes operating at this interface and the strategies used to derive energy and nutrients, our proposal is firmly aligned with the aims and objectives of the Biogeosciences Program. In combining cutting-edge geochemical and microbiological approaches, we will also be generally improving methods and research techniques for the study of geomicrobial processes. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This proposal focuses on teaching and training and will support the training of a new postdoctoral investigator and graduate student at MIT and will provide unparalleled research opportunities for undergraduates interested in the biogeosciences, including significant collaborative interactions in the field and laboratory at three institutions. Providing meaningful and positive research experiences in multidisciplinary science to college undergraduates is critical to fostering the next generation of researchers and educators. Because the focal point of our research is one of the US's most visited national parks, there will be enhanced opportunities for public dissemination of our results. We will work directly with the Park Service to develop educational materials, including scientifically sound treatment of the philosophical and practical aspects of fundamental research pertaining to ""origins of life"" and ""limits of life"" concepts."

Gao (Virginia Tech)<br/><br/>Abstract: Global optimization problems are widespread in the mathematical modelling of real world systems for a very broad range of applications. Due to the nonconvexity of the cost functions, many problems in global optimization are NP-hard. Traditional direct methods and local optimization procedures can not guarantee the identification of the global minima. On the other hand, duality theory and methods may provide potentially important influence on the solutions and algorithms for global optimization problems.<br/>The primary goal of this project is to develop a general canonical primal-dual method and its associated triality theory in global optimization. The project focuses on a general constrained global optimization problem, which arises directly from numerical discretization of a large class of nonconvex variational problems in engineering mechanics. The secondary goal is to advance the development of certain powerful primal-dual algorithms with concrete applications to nonconvex mechanics.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed work includes <br/>(1) a potentially powerful canonical dual transformation which can be used to formulate perfect dual problems (with zero duality gap); <br/>(2) an interesting triality theory which can serve as an optimality criterion to identify both global minima and local extrema of nonconvex function. <br/>Each of these aspects presents its own challenges. Formulation of perfect dual problems requires nonstandard methods, as the traditional duality theory in convex analysis may lead to a so-called duality gap when the primal problem is nonconvex. Global optimality criterion for nonconvex/nonsmooth functions over feasible spaces will need special mathematical techniques due to the loss of convexity and smoothness.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are potentially very great as the proposed problem arises in multi-disciplinary fields of global optimization, nonconvex/nonsmooth analysis, engineering mechanics, modern materials, mathematical physics, and scientific computation. The general methodology of canonical dual transformation and the beautiful triality theory will bridge the existing gaps among these fields. The broad distribution of software and publications (including a set of three volumes of Handbook of Duality Theory in Engineering Science to be published by Springer) will benefit practitioners and scientists across engineering, mathematics, physics, and computational science. Two international conferences on global optimization and nonconvex mechanics will be organized in 2005 and 2006, respectively. These conferences will open new trends in modern analysis, optimization, and engineering science. Furthermore, they will stimulate young faculty and students to venture into this rich domain of research. The proposed work will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team at Virginia Tech which includes both undergraduate and graduate students from math and engineering departments. <br/>The completion of this project will lay a ground work in global optimization, nonconvex mechanics, and computational science."

We propose a novel solution that exploits new<br/>high resolution satellite imagery (2m, FORMOSAT-2) with unusually high revisit frequency (daily) over<br/>a region of very broad interest to the earth science community (Taiwan). Our proposed method entails<br/>the collation of a time series (2004-2005) of orthorecti*ed, georeferenced images of selected mountain<br/>river channels, in tandem with contemporaneous stage measurements of discharge at the nearest gauging<br/>station downstream. Patterns of inundation along selected channel reaches will be mapped in each<br/>image. With the aid of cross-channel profiles mapped in the field at low stage, we will make estimates<br/>of low width, depth, mean bed shear stress and mean low velocity. Once a broad range of discharges<br/>has been processed, we expect to be able to construct rating curves for these low measures as a function<br/>of the directly observed, at-station stage data. Combination of the rating models with the multi-decadal<br/>archive of station data in Taiwan will permit an assessment of the long-term probability distributions of<br/>low widths, depths and shear stresses along and across the selected bedrock channels. Measurements of<br/>this kind, albeit indirect, will be of enormous interest to the geomorphology community. However, the<br/>method is by no means guaranteed, because remote river gauging has never been attempted in mountain<br/>catchments; it remains to be seen whether the precision of the anticipated rating curves will suffice for<br/>rivers akin to those of the Taiwan Central Range. The main task of the pilot project will be to address<br/>this issue and to lay the foundation for a more comprehensive, longer-term assessment of Taiwanese<br/>mountain river discharge.<br/>Broader outcomes: While low measurements in steep mountain rivers are particularly sought after by<br/>those interested in bedrock channel processes, they are also of great interest beyond: from modelers<br/>of landscape evolution and the interaction between climate and tectonics, to hydrologists preoccupied<br/>with the assessment of flood hazard in populated mountain environments. Moreover, if the pilot project<br/>proves successful it will provide the Taiwanese space agency with an excellent example of the value of<br/>FORMOSAT-2 in natural hazard assessment, one of its principal missions. As a result, more attention<br/>will be paid to the regular acquisition of FORMOSAT-2 imagery in tropical mountain areas, an essential<br/>step if the elusive goal of a high-resolution, multitemporal image archive is to be achieved - at present,<br/>images of highland areas are a relatively low prioity (for FORMOSAT-2 and other equivalent satellites)<br/>and are only acquired daily during emergency periods (e.g. typhoons). Such an archive would be widely<br/>appreciated across the discplines of earth sciences, hydrology, ecology, not to mention in remote-sensing<br/>R&D itself.<br/>A-1"

This multi-step program will be begun by defining the circuitry in the fruit<br/>fly subserving its recognition, selective attention, and novelty responses, analyzing the<br/>contributions, connections, and interactions of these circuit elements both behaviorally and<br/>physiogically, and then introducing this neural architecture as the basis for the computer-simulated<br/>brain in a brain-based device capable of displaying novelty recognition.<br/>We will use techniques of gene targeting that we have developed previously to identify<br/>the parts of the brain contributing to recognition, selective attention, and novelty responses. We<br/>will map the sites in the nervous system mediating the effect by manipulating neural activity.<br/>This will be achieved in two opposing ways: one way by blocking activity and the other by<br/>increasing activity.

As is the<br/>case with animals, the behaviors of brain-based devices emerge solely as a result of internally<br/>generated activity of their nervous systems rather than of responses to any programmed<br/>instructions from computer software. Such devices are particularly useful in situations of novelty<br/>where computation is not possible in principle or in cases of great local complexity where<br/>programming proves infeasible. Such a device must confront novel situations and complex sets of<br/>parameters that must be dealt with rapidly. Our goal is to implement principles from the fruit fly<br/>system into such a device, using as our platform an existing brain-based device developed at The<br/>Neurosciences Institute.<br/>Aim 3: Introduce a simulated neural architecture based on the functional network for novelty<br/>detection defined in Aims 1 & 2 into a brain-based device.<br/>The long-term goal of this work is to understand the principles upon which the nervous<br/>system of the fruit fly operates as the basis for neurobiologically inspired computational devices.<br/>The principles underlying nervous system function hold promise for developing a new generation<br/>of devices that would be more capable of adaptive behavior than current systems. The most<br/>sophisticated behavior seen in either biological or artificial agents is shown by organisms whose<br/>behavior is guided by a nervous system. The fruit fly offers the requisite complexity to be of<br/>value in this endeavor, while being simple enough (i.e., small enough in neuron number) to be<br/>amenable to analysis. Most importantly, it offers sophistication afforded by a multi-disciplinary<br/>experimental approach (genetics, anatomy, physiology and behavior) to be followed by computer<br/>simulation and device implementation."

Different kinds of records on a given individual may exist in different databases - a type of data fragmentation. Even with standards, however, the ability to integrate schemas automatically is an open research issue. A related issue is the fact that current Association Rule Mining (ARM) algorithms for mining distributed data are capable of mining data (whether vertically or horizontally fragmented) only when the global schema across all databases is known. In the case of information extracted from distributed textual data, no preexisting global schema is available. This is due to the fact that the entities extracted vary between documents - new input text can contain previously unseen entities. As a result, a fixed global schema cannot be assumed and existing algorithms cannot be employed.<br/><br/>This effort describes a distributed higher-order text mining framework that requires neither the knowledge of the global schema nor schema integration as a precursor to mining rules. The framework, termed D-HOTM, extracts entities and discovers rules based on higher-order associations between entities in records linked by a common key. The entity extraction is based on information extraction rules learned using a semi-supervised active learning algorithm previously developed. The rules learned are applied to automatically extract entities from textual data that describe, for example, criminal modus operandi. The entities extracted are stored in local relational databases, which are mined using the D-HOTM distributed association rule mining algorithm.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of thework lie in the collaboration with local law enforcement and healthcare providers for deploying live test beds that enable problem solving by mining reports and identificaiton of physician best practices. Pre-college internships are provided for students as well as support for graduate students."

The organizers are Dr. Ramana Pidaparti and Dr. Mohamed Gad-el-Hak, in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond and Dr. Atef Sherif, National Agency for Remote Sensing and Space Science (NARSS) in Cairo, Dr. Basman El-Hadidi, Cairo University and Dr. Hamdi Kandil, Alexandria University, Egypt. This grant supports travel of 12 U.S. scientists to participate in the workshop. A number of events related to global weather conditions and natural disasters will likely challenge the world scientists and engineers in the 21st century. The reality of global warming and desertification will have serious effects in some parts of the world, particularly in developing, desert-dominated nations such as Egypt. Contributing to the problem is the lack of accurate modeling of the weather in Egypt, the Nile Basin and North Africa. Reliable prediction of rainfall and evaporation from lakes and basins along the Nile valley can assist strategic decision making related to water management in Egypt. The objective of the proposed workshop on global weather related disasters is to identify the technical challenges and the need for collaboration in the areas of computational modeling and simulations. The workshop report will be disseminated in electronic format as well as CD's and through conference proceedings. The long-term goal is to enhance existing analytical and computational methods, and improve understanding and prediction of the issues related to natural disasters. The workshop will stimulate future research Collaboration, and advance the modeling and simulation techniques for predicting large-scale weather related regional climatic changes.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Global weather related disasters do happen, and developing predictive methodologies will be of interest to the international community. The proposed workshop will shape the research agenda in identifying the issues related to predictive methodologies, which will further help in avoiding or at least returning the damage of natural disasters.<br/><br/>Broader impact: Four junior U.S. scientists are expected to participate in this international activity. The predictive methodologies for the issues identified from the workshop agenda and will have applications in broad scientific methods. The results from the proposed workshop are expected to establish a research agenda that will benefit the agricultural, industrial and service sectors, and broaden the scope of investigations of current environmental concerns in Egypt, U.S. and other countries in general. This project is being supported, in part, under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these joint scientific activities."

Reportedly, locals and tourists seeking vertical evacuation to avoid the floodwaters encountered winds that gushed through broken windows with drenching rains and sent them scurrying for shelter in the interior parts of these high-rise buildings. The NatHaz Modeling Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame ( www.nd.edu/~nathaz ) will conduct a field reconnaissance study to assess first-hand the damage to cladding and glass of high-rise buildings, and will secure perishable information and data. The focus of this study is on gathering surface wind records in the locale of these buildings or in their surrounding areas, and examining the damage to glass and cladding of high-rise buildings. Based on wind directions, availability of flying debris in their path, scenarios for the damage of glass/cladding will be established. This information will be used in correlating wind speeds to the observed damage, in establishing possible causes of damage and in assessing the adequacy of building codes and standards. In light of the breaches in building envelopes through broken glass experienced by many buildings, the potential of these buildings for possible vertical evacuation will be examined from structural integrity and functionality perspectives. The final report will catalog the collected information and observations based on the preliminary analysis for dissemination to other researchers in structural engineering as well as emergency management areas for follow-up studies. <br/><br/>The findings of this study will provide significant input on the performance of glass cladding of buildings in hurricane prone regions. This would assist communities in hurricane areas to assess the condition of their buildings prior to hurricane season for possible retrofits. This study will also provide a critical input to emergency management groups in the coastal regions of U.S. threatened by hurricanes for assessing the viability of vertical evacuation in high-rise buildings."

Late blight remains a significant agricultural problem. Worldwide, P.infestans causes over $5 billion in annual losses in potato production alone, making it the single greatest pathogen threat to global food security. The goal of this project is to produce a high quality genome sequence of P. infestans and make it maximally useful to researchers working to control this pathogen. This will include identification of the genes, improvement of data to support genetic studies, tools for viewing and accessing the genome and genes, and development of education, training and outreach programs centered on this program and its findings. Importantly, all data generated will be promptly released in public databases.<br/><br/>A genome sequence is the key resource to understanding the biology of an organism at the molecular level. Historically, the availability of a genome sequence of an organism has had an immediate and transforming effect on research into its biology, leading to an explosion of research and discovery. The extraordinary progress that has followed the release of the human and Arabidopsis genomes sequences are notable examples of this. With the P. infestans genome sequence in hand, it will be possible to: <br/>o Prepare a list of the genes of the organism<br/>o Study the function of its genes, and do so in a the context of a complete gene set<br/>o Compare this genome to the genomes of related sequenced organisms to find genes and other elements conserved through evolution and to look for critical differences<br/>o Identify gene targets for potential fungicides or other control agents<br/>o Better understand key aspects of pathogenicity, including plant infection, host specificity and reproduction.<br/><br/>The remarkable historical and contemporary impact of P. infestans offers unique opportunities in outreach and training. Outreach activities will include organizing a series of workshops on ""forensic pathogen DNA from the Irish potato famine"" in partnership with high schools and museums, integrating P.infestans economics into online teaching curricula, and developing a mobile exhibit on the potato famine pathogen. In addition, results from the sequencing project will be incorporated into classes at the undergraduate and graduate levels.<br/><br/>This project is being supported through a collaboration of the National Science Foundation and the National Research Initiative of the Cooperative Research, Education, and Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture."

(CUAHSI). CUAHSI has prepared a science agenda that identifies the interfaces among traditional boundaries among the atmosphere, land surface, groundwater and surface-water subdisciplines as the most promising areas for research. Substantive progress will only be achieved with multidisciplinary approaches applied at larger spatial scales to obtain coherent data sets than have typically been done in the past. CUAHSI envisages four mutually supportive infrastructure elements to meet this goal: 1) a network of hydrologic observatories, 2) an information system, 3) a measurement technologies program, and 4) a hydrologic synthesis facility. This project requests funds to provide a core support for the development and management of these facilities as well as to initiate the observatories and synthesis facility.<br/>Because this scale of coordinated research has not been previously attempted by the hydrologic science community, we propose to begin with a 'paper prototype' of a single river basin (a hydrologic observatory) designed to address a small set of specific hypotheses carefully chosen to yield a data set that will provide a robust characterization of the basin. Thus a data set sufficient to answer important questions and broad enough to be useful for many studies will emerge. The prototype will identify both the scientific and economic synergies from coordinating research in a single river basin. The Neuse River has been chosen as the site for this prototype.<br/>The second proposed activity is to initiate a hydrologic synthesis facility, envisioned as a place where hydrologic scientists from various disciplines can come together conveniently and at low marginal cost to tackle central problems in the field. A workshop to design the facility and funding for an initial synthesis project, including a competition for its selection, are proposed.<br/>This project will permit hydrologic science to make fundamental advances by providing facilities with capabilities currently unavailable to the community. These activities have been chosen to provide the greatest return on investment to move hydrologic science to a new plane of understanding. The benefits to society of improved hydrologic understanding are manifold, including more reliable forecasting of conditions and wiser management of water resources."

The study and model development will focus on this protozoan parasite because T. gondii is the major cause of death in southern sea otters, and otters serve as a valuable sentinel for marine pollution with this important human pathogen. Focusing on two coastal sites where T. gondii infections and mortality in sea otters are prevalent, this integrated study has three components that link terrestrial ecology to land use patterns and ultimately to sea otter ecology.  Investigators from University of California at Davis, California State University at Fresno, Institute of Ecosystems Study, and University of British Columbia will predict terrestrial environmental contamination with oocysts and risk of exposure to T. gondii based on the prevalence of infection in domestic felids and wild rodent populations.  The investigators hypothesize that there is a distinct spatial pattern of risk for otters because land runoff forms well-defined zones at specific locations in coastal waters, and high oocyst concentrations are expected in these zones.  Finally, they propose to study whether individual otter diet and movements can predict the risk of exposure and death from protozoal encephalitis caused by T. gondii infection.  Data from the three components will permit evaluating the impact of alternative control strategies using simulation modeling to test whether reduction of putative risk factors will reduce site-specific incidence and prevalence of T. gondii in otters. This project is unique in its multidisciplinary and comprehensive approach - incorporating terrestrial and marine ecologists, oceanographers, epidemiologists, and parasitologists to investigate the ecology of an important environmental pathogen at the interface of terrestrial and aquatic systems.  <br/> <br/>In terms of the broader impacts of this study, this project emphasizes graduate student training in research and outreach. Overall, 4 Ph.D. and 2 Masters students will be mentored in research and outreach efforts. The simulation model will permit evaluation of different control strategies to reduce pathogen pollution of the near shore marine environment. This will benefit the threatened southern sea otter population that is struggling to recover, as well as other marine wildlife and humans in coastal areas. Sea otters are a flagship species with extremely high visibility, which provides a unique opportunity to inform the public about the land-sea interface and pathogen pollution.  A public website www.seaotterresearch.org will be expanded to include specific information on the goals of this study and to publicize the findings in a public-friendly format with special interactive sections devoted to younger students (K-8), land and water resource managers, and cat owners. A brochure explaining risks of toxoplasmosis, suggested best practices for cat owners, and methods to reduce environmental exposure to T. gondii will be provided to the cat-owning public through pet product retailers and veterinarians in coastal areas. Sea otter bookmarks with the web address will also be provided at no cost through pet product retailers and schools in the high impact areas. Public town hall meetings will be organized and attended by senior personnel and students at both study sites to inform and discuss with local residents the rationale, design and findings of the study. Each of the graduate students involved in the project will be trained in public relations/speaking and will be required to make at least 2 presentations per year at schools and public meetings in high-risk communities. In addition, to original research publications, students will present the results of this research at national scientific conferences.<br/><br/>"

Remarkably, the bacteria found attached to particles are genetically distinct from those in the surrounding water. Bacteria that colonize particles employ species-specific enzymes that breakdown the organic content at different rates. Since sinking particles in the ocean represent a major mechanism influencing global carbon flux, bacterial metabolic activity on marine particles is an important factor in biogeochemical cycling. However, little is known regarding the variables that regulate microbial diversity on and around marine particles. This study will investigate mechanisms controlling micro-scale diversity and interactions among marine microorganisms colonizing particles. A specific focus will be microbial competition, and the possibility that pelagic bacterial population structures are influenced by the production of antibiotics. Experiments will be conducted to quantify the effects of bacterial antagonistic interactions at the molecular, single-bacteria cell, consortia, and community levels. The colonization of model particles by microbial natural assemblages will be measured in response to fluorescence-tagged antagonistic strains. Growth and respiration of sensitive strains in close proximity to antagonistic bacteria will be measured to quantify interactions at the single-cell level. Molecules produced by antagonistic bacteria will be identified and tested for their effects on particle colonization by single strains and natural consortia of bacteria. <br/><br/>This is the first, in depth investigation to probe cell-cell antagonistic interactions as a micro-scale factor involved in structuring marine microbial communities. Knowledge of microbial diversity on suspended particles will be advanced, and the interactions and specific adaptations involved in surface colonization will be better understood. This endeavor will further fuse connections between marine bacterial chemical ecology, microbial diversity, and biogeochemical cycling. Undergraduate and graduate students will be cross-trained in chemical ecology and molecular microbial ecology, and future teachers will learn molecular and microbiological techniques and concepts during one-year internships."

This project will use a combination of state-of-the-art global hybrid (kinetic ions, fluid electrons) simulations and comparison with spacecraft data to address this problem. The project has two phases. The first concerns the entry of plasma into the magnetosphere on the dayside magnetopause, while the second concerns phenomena that occur on the magnetotail flanks and the processes that transfer incoming solar wind plasma into the plasma sheet. Initially, the focus will be on issues such as the influences of the bow shock, ion foreshock and magnetosheath on dayside transport during steady and non-steady solar wind conditions. Formation of low latitude (LLBL) and high latitude (HLBL) boundary layers and their structure will be investigated. Next, the transport of the boundary layer plasma will be followed to assess its contributions to the plasma sheet population. In addition, direct entry mechanisms into the plasma sheet through the tail lobes and flanks will be investigated. The proposed modeling and spacecraft data analysis activities are designed to take advantage of the strength of each approach and achieving a synergy that will lead to an understanding of solar wind entry into the magnetosphere and its paths to the plasma sheet. By virtue of resolving ion temporal and spatial scales, global hybrid simulations are uniquely suited for addressing plasma transport questions such as the relative significance of reconnection and wave-particle interactions or local vs. non-local processes. In addition to the basic plasma moments (density, flow speed etc.), hybrid simulations will provide ion velocity distribution functions throughout the magnetosphere. The kinetic treatment of ions makes it possible to investigate mass filtering effects at the magnetopause and to trace the orbit of ions in a self consistent manner."

The organizers are Dr. Joyce Ray, Associate Deputy Director for Library Services at the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) in Washington, DC and Dr. Noha Adly, Information and Communication Director at the Bibliotheca Alexanderina, Alexandria, Egypt. The workshop will involve representatives from the U.S. and Egypt, and participants from other Middle Eastern countries. The workshop has two distinct but related objectives, to elucidate the requirements and mechanisms for building regional information networks and infrastructure, and to develop plans for a Digital Library of the Middle East whose content will focus on the cultural heritage of the Middle East. The Bibliotheca Alexandrina, a leader in promoting cultural heritage research, will host the workshop as part of its role as an information and research center, demonstrating the importance and utility that information technologies play in building and preserving digital cultural heritage assets.<br/><br/>The NSF has in the past decade sponsored numerous activities to strengthen Internet connections among U.S. Research and Education Networks (RENs) and their counterpart RENs in many parts of the world. To date, however, efforts to build such links to the Middle East and Africa have lagged behind. This project brings together countries in the Middle East to compare and formulate strategies for developing national and regional RENs. The workshop will not only help to strengthen collaborative links between U.S. and Middle Eastern scientists working in the cultural heritage disciplines, but will also lay the groundwork for regional and national RENs that will enable a wide range of collaborations between Middle Eastern and U.S. researchers in many science and engineering disciplines. Finally, the outcomes of the workshop should strengthen the position of Middle Eastern researchers in the global mainstream of scientific communication, which now includes sharing of massive amounts of digital content. <br/><br/>Rapid advances in technology make it now feasible to create extremely accurate digital facsimiles of a wide variety of cultural heritage materials that capture and in many cases increase the scholarly value of the originals while creating unlimited possibilities for shared use. The workshop will identify and promote new opportunities to collect, organize, and make available through digital technologies materials related to the cultural heritage of a region of almost unparalleled cultural and archaeological riches. The Middle East includes the ancient land of Mesopotamia where some of mankind's great civilizations began, the lands where three major religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, emerged, and the lands where the first written language, cunieform, appeared about 4500 years ago. The value of cultural artifacts has long been recognized with the unfortunate consequence that important objects and parts of archaeological sites have been transported to different locations around the world. Piecing back together the history of the Middle East will involve the efforts of an international cadre of scholars from a wide range of disciplines, including historians, physical and cultural anthropologists, archeologist and other domain experts working with computer scientists, digital library experts and curators. Bringing together such diverse communities can build new intellectual programs of research and scholarship in the Middle East as well as in the U.S.<br/><br/>This project is being supported under the U.S.-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these joint scientific activities. Additional funds have been provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering to ensure that the workshop will have wide participation from Middle East countries."

Main St, Suite 710"	Durham	NC	277054010	9196843030	SBE	1699	"0000, OTHR"	$0.00	"The ability to focus attention on elements of our sensory environment is a critical cognitive function that enables one to enhance the processing of high priority stimuli. A classic auditory example is the ""cocktail party effect,"" in which a person can focus selectively on a particular speaker while tuning out other conversations. In vision, attending to a particular region of the visual field results in faster and better discrimination of stimuli in that region. In recent years, both electrophysiological and functional brain imaging studies have suggested that a network of frontal and parietal brain areas enables selective attention by enhancing the responses in sensory cortices in favor of task-relevant stimuli. Almost all studies of attention, however, have been conducted within a single sensory modality. The real world is multisensory, numerous real objects have multisensory characteristics (e.g., both auditory and visual aspects) that need to be attended, perceived, and integrated. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Marty Woldorff is combining electrical and functional imaging measures of brain activity to study the mechanisms by which attention operates in a multisensory world. This includes the study of (1) whether there are separate attentional resources for processing stimuli in different sensory modalities, (2) how attention influences multisensory integration processes, and (3) how attention may spread from one sensory modality to another in a multisensory object. Recording both electrical and functional imaging measures of brain activity during the performance of multisensory attentional tasks will reveal the location, timing, and sequence of the brain mechanisms underlying multisensory attentional processes.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project relate to the fact that the real world is multisensory, but the mechanisms by which attention operates in multisensory circumstances are far from understood. As just one example, every day millions of motorists drive on streets and highways in the multisensory environment of a car, in which they must cope with a myriad of visual and auditory sensory inputs, including police sirens, car horns, radios, talking passengers and misbehaving children. Understanding processing limitations and how attention facilitates performance by influencing multisensory interactions is of fundamental importance for understanding the performance of such everyday real-life activities. Moreover, understanding these mechanisms could have a large, practical impact on matters ranging from the training of drivers to the design of cars and cockpits. The present work also has impact for understanding the mechanisms by which people integrate the auditory content of speech with the visual input of mouth and head movements, a function fundamental for human beings everywhere. Lastly, gaining basic scientific understanding concerning how attention operates in multisensory circumstances has impact not only for individuals with normal perceptual and attentional capabilities, but also for individuals in whom such capabilities have been impaired through injury or other causes."

Unfortunately, these ecosystems are being degraded worldwide due to infectious disease, human activities, and climate change.  Poorly studied members of this rapidly deteriorating ecosystem are the Bacteria and Archaea.  Although recent studies have made progress toward our understanding of coral-associated microbial communities, there are substantial areas that have not been explored.  Since these coral reef ecosystems are at risk, it is important to assess microbial biodiversity before habitat destruction worsens.  Their two key objectives for the NSF Biodiversity Survey and Inventories proposal are to (1) survey microbial diversity associated with three different coral species collected from two sites in the Caribbean, and (2) disseminate this information in an online database while promoting education and training of students and junior personnel.  Samples of coral mucus, coral tissue, and background seawater will be analyzed to distinguish the microbial communities uniquely associated with each sample type.  They will take both a culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach to the survey. Carbon source utilization patterns and DNA fingerprinting approaches (e.g., denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, 16S rDNA cloning) will be used to characterize whole communities.  Microbial isolates will be characterized in terms of cell morphology and motility, growth characteristics, antibiotic resistance patterns, production of cell-signaling molecules, and phylogeny.  The data obtained will be channeled into a public, online database that will be developed by all members of the research team for the purposes of disseminating and sharing of information regarding coral microbial communities among the broader scientific community. <br/>Educational opportunities at the high school, undergraduate  (through two NSF undergraduate research programs), graduate, and postdoctoral levels will be incorporated into each stage of the proposed project.  All members of the research team will work cooperatively in a very dynamic setting to both collect and evaluate the data, as well as contribute to website development and database design.  They will also develop a special topics course to be offered each summer of the proposed project entitled ""Coral Biology:  The Complex Role of Microorganisms in Coral Health and Disease.""  The proposed work will foster collaboration between two US-based educational institutions (Medical Univ. of South Carolina, Univ. of South Carolina-Aiken,), The Institute for Genomic Research (TGIR), and an international organization, the Colombian Institute for Marine and Coastal Research (INVEMAR).<br/><br/>"

To improve space weather prediction, this project combines a physics-based model of the ionosphere and thermosphere with targeted measurements, a process known as targeted data assimilation. The proposed research includes extensions of data assimilation algorithms to address nonlinear dynamics, model error, and computational complexity. Dynamically steered experiments involving the Millstone Observatory and EISCAT incoherent scatter radars will demonstrate the ability of targeted data assimilation to improve the quality and value of measurements for space weather prediction. The proposed research is relevant to NOAA. The project's goal is to improve space weather prediction in the ionosphere and thermosphere. The ability to predict the effects of solar storms is needed to protect humans and technological systems. Humans in manned spaced flight, as well as in commercial aircraft, are affected by solar storms, and total radiation dosages are a growing concern. Technological systems are also affected. For example, magnetic field fluctuations induce currents in electric power lines, which can damage components of the power grid causing blackouts and substantial economic losses. The accuracy of GPS,widely used for military and commercial operations, is commonly degraded by these events. The proposed research will greatly benefit the incoherent scatter radar (ISR) community. Since ISRs require high power, they are extremely expensive to run, and thus every radar experiment must be chosen for maximal efficiency. This efficiency is difficult to achieve in practice, however, since radars work in different modes and scan different parts of the ionosphere. This project will improve ISR efficiency by allowing operators to observe what may be happening if the radar mode or look direction were changed. This methodology will fundamentally change the way radars are run, since operators will be able to make informed decisions on what science they can accomplish by changing modes. When an experiment is not yielding useful results, operators will be able examine model results that simulate alternative radar modes, and thus dynamically switch experiments. This ability will dramatically improve the efficiency of the radars."

QMC is one among the most precise known techniques to study realistic materials in physics and chemistry and provide a significant gain in precision compared traditional density functional theory (DFT) approaches. This will bring electronic structure quantum Monte Carlo methodology to a qualitatively higher level of applicability to complex materials and lead to increased accuracy. The new QMC techniques will be applied to forefront problems in the properties of Earth materials in order to obtain accurate equations of state, phase transitions, and elasticity of solid materials that are of high interest in geophysics. One significant limitation of today's QMC methods is the high computational demand, which currently makes applications to larger systems including solid solutions prohibitively expensive. A substantial portion of the QMC computation is spent on forming and evaluating a Slater determinant, which is constructed from one-particle orbitals. The team plans to develop and apply different localization transformations in order to obtain a sparse determinant. Two linear algebra methods will be developed for their efficient evaluation. First, Krylov's method for the iterative evaluation of a determinant will be incorporated into QMC. Secondly, the trace of the determinant will be calculated with Monte Carlo methods. Both techniques will further the goal of obtaining an order-N QMC techniques that are more efficient and applicable to a wider range of materials, well beyond the current possibilities.<br/><br/>Computational mineral physics is part of the large effort to use computer simulations to predict and understand properties of the Earth. New mathematical techniques will be derived to make advance quantum Monte Carlo simulations more precise and significantly more efficient.

This work will also lead to a more precise description of a number of fundamental phase transitions in solid deep Earth. This project is a close collaboration between a mathematician, mathematical physicists, and geophysicists. It will bring new applied math methods into geoscience, with broad applicability to all Earth materials. The broader impact will include the development of new computational techniques applicable to many areas as well as the education of graduate students and post-docs in state-of-the-art materials simulations, teaching of new computational techniques in graduate level classes and during two workshops that will be organized."

We learn to swing a hammer in a manner that strikes the nail accurately; we learn to press the brake with an appropriate level of force to decelerate the car smoothly; and we learn to move a computer mouse in order to proficiently utilize software. As technology becomes increasingly complex in its operations, its functionality, and its degree of interaction with the user, there is a growing need to embed adaptability and intelligence into the device itself. In this situation, the device and the user simultaneously learn in an attempt to optimize their interactions. The degree of success in this sensorimotor learning process depends strongly on the interaction between the person and the engineered system. <br/><br/>The focus of the Center of Excellence in Adaptive and Neuro-Biomechatronic Systems (CEANS) will be to understand and to optimize the learning that occurs as humans interact with adaptive technology. The Center will focus its efforts on addressing a few broad questions: What are the biological processes that occur as a person learns to interact with a device? How do the properties of the device affect the learning process? How can we design engineering devices to maximize the effectiveness of the learning process? <br/><br/>CEANS will use advanced prosthetic systems as a research platform to address these questions regarding the nature of the sensorimotor learning process and to develop strategies for the design of adaptive systems to achieve specific learning outcomes. After a traumatic injury such as limb loss or spinal cord injury, technology can assist in tasks such as stepping, reaching or grasping. Several intelligent robotic devices and electrical stimulation systems with adaptive capabilities that are either on the market or on the horizon require that the person learn to use the device as the device adapts to meet the needs of the person. CEANS will use these types of co-adaptive prosthetic systems to investigate the molecular, cellular and systems-level dynamics of sensorimotor learning.<br/><br/>Our goal for this Catalyst project is to lay the foundation for a Science of Learning Center that addresses key issues regarding learning in the integration of adaptive biological systems with adaptive engineered systems. In the planning period, we will develop a proposal for a Center that integrates interdisciplinary research and development with educational and outreach programs. Our research agenda will be at the intersection of molecular biology, neuroscience, mathematics, bioengineering, and rehabilitation. CEANS will draw upon a wide range of expertise to discover the principles that govern activity-dependent learning in living systems, to develop novel approaches to sense dynamic changes in adaptive living systems, and to deliver new adaptive technology for sensorimotor learning. The scope of activities will include experimental biological investigation, design and development of new technology to maximize learning outcomes, the evaluation of the effects of the technology on biological learning processes, and the transfer of these techniques to biomedical industry and clinical practice."

Such `smart dust' is of any use only if the various transceivers are very cheap, use very little energy, so that they are around for a long time, and do not cost much to put in place. In particular, the transceivers cannot be expected to be able to transmit far, and must be placed in essentially random positions. This leads us to numerous mathematical problems, several of which we hope to attack.<br/><br/>For example, a mathematical model of one of many real-life problems goes as follows. Suppose we have a large number of points (radio transceivers) in a square or circular disc, distributed at random. Let N be the network obtained by connecting each point to the k points nearest to it (each transceiver can communicate with the k transceivers nearest to it). How large should k be in order to make it likely that the network N is connected? In other words, how large should k be to make it likely that, for any two transceivers x and y, a message can be sent from x to y via a sequence of transceivers, i.e., there are transceivers a, b, ... , u, such that the message can be sent from x to a, from a to b, etc., and finally from u to y.<br/><br/>There are numerous other mathematical problems related to ad hoc wireless networks: for example, in the problem above we may relax the requirement that the entire network be connected, and want only a large set of transceivers that can communicate with each other. It also makes sense to care about the speed with which a message can be transmitted to faraway transceivers, and we may want to investigate how an efficient route can be identified. In yet another problem, we should take into account the interference encountered if several nearby transceivers broadcast at the same time.<br/><br/>The problems above belong to the theory of random geometric graphs, an area started by Gilbert about 45 years ago, but, curiously, still not too well developed. Our aim in this NSF project is to identify a number of problems that are not only of interest from the point of view of pure mathematics, but also have substantial applications to large ad hoc wireless networks."

When new species evolve from an ancestral one, their hybrids usually have several developmental or physiological problems, like infertility or lower vigor. Those problems are the result of incompatible genetic changes that have occurred in each one of the species during and after speciation. Trying to pinpoint what are those genetic changes has been difficult using traditional genetic methods. However, recently developed molecular methods that allow investigators obtain a snapshot of gene activity in all genes from an organism at any given time (""microarrays"") provide an alternative, or complement, to traditional genetic methods to uncover the genetic changes underlying hybrid incompatibilities. We will use microarrays to explore this question in a classic group of fruit fly species: Drosophila pseudoobscura and its close relatives D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura bogotana. We will investigate gene activity in hybrid sterile males from those species to first determine what genes have unusual levels of activity and will follow up only genes with unusual activity that are involved in reproduction. We will then establish whether a subset of those genes is indeed involved in hybrid sterility using traditional genetic methods (i.e. a series of genetic crosses). Finally, we will determine whether genetic changes that have occurred at those genes or at other genes that affect their activity are indeed responsible for the hybrid incompatibilities. This approach is likely to provide major insights into the identity of genes responsible for hybrid incompatibilities in these and other group of species. <br/><br/>The results of the proposed research will be of general interest to biologists and will allow us training students in functional genomics and evolutionary genetics. We are fully committed to integrate individuals from underrepresented groups in our research program. Finally, the identification of putative hybrid male sterility genes in Drosophila could lead to the discovery of similar genes also involved in human male infertility, and thus the health implications of the proposed research may be large."

Because characters are affected by many genes, and because genes affect many characters, variation in different characters (e.g., arm length and leg length) are not independent of each other. The genetic variance-covariance matrix (G-matrix) summarizes these interdependencies. This study will estimate the G-matrix for eight species of Anolis lizards. Because species of these lizards on different islands have adapted to the same environment, this study will allow the comparison of distantly related species that have experienced the same natural selection pressures, as well as closely related species that live on the same island, but have experienced different selective pressures. These comparisons will permit evaluation of the factors that affect how the G-matrix evolves. <br/><br/>The G-matrix is of fundamental importance in describing evolutionary change by translating natural selection in one generation into phenotypic change in the next. Nonetheless, scientists still do not have a good understanding of what factors affect evolution of the G-matrix. By examining many species, this study will be the most extensive study to date and will thus greatly expand understanding of the genetics underlying evolutionary change. This project will support the training of a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and several undergraduates, including students from traditionally underrepresented groups. Anolis lizards have become one of the major models for studying evolutionary diversification and relaying that understanding to a broad audience. Accounts of Anolis evolution have appeared in countless textbooks, television programs and popular publications. This project will continue those efforts."

The requested funds would be highly leveraged because most of the cost of drilling a 5km deep borehole will be borne by industry and the Icelandic government, with participation from the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program. An Icelandic geothermal power company is providing an existing ~ 3 km deep well for deepening to 5 km depth. This project will provide the first opportunity worldwide to investigate the deep, high temperature reaction zone of a mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal system, which has been a long-standing goal of the Ocean Drilling Program. This drill site is ideally situated for a broad array of scientific studies involving reactions between basalt and seawater at high temperatures, reaching supercritical conditions. Such active processes in the deep, high temperature reaction zones that control fluid compositions of black smokers have never before been available for comprehensive direct study and sampling. Ocean drilling has penetrated only 2 km into 5 Ma old ocean crust. where temperatures were ~ 180 oC. In contrast, the IDDP collaboration with industry in Iceland will produce fluid samples from the flow tests at 3, 4, and 5 km, drill cuttings and spot cores down to 4.0 km depth, and 1.0 km of continuous drill core from 4.0 to 5.0 km depth. These samples will reveal the integrated record of basalt-seawater interactions at >400oC. The study of these materials will permit a quantum leap in our understanding of active hydrothermal processes that are important on a global scale, <br/><br/>The funds provided will be used for: (1) coring for scientific purposes; (2) support for the scientific program at the well site, for fluid sampling, for core handling, and for basic petrologic characterization of the cores, and distribution of sub-samples and data to an approved list of international scientists; and (3) support for a coordinated group of US Co-PI's investigating hydrothermal water/rock interactions and geochemical modeling. The core and fluids that will be retrieved may characterize the lower boundary of a major hydrothermal system and thus provide important evidence about what controls the upper temperature limits of hydrothermal systems."

Traditional database management systems (DBMS) are not designed to handle such applications, especially if the application requires managing a large number of moving objects. The goal of the COMET (Continuous Management of Evolving Trajectories) project is to design, implement, and build a database management system for managing large repositories of continuously evolving trajectories data sets. Since in these environments location updates are issued continually, the DBMS must support extremely efficient methods for dealing with updates. In addition, to allow querying on previous locations of the moving objects, the DBMS must keep track of past trajectories. As time passes these trajectories continue to increase in length, and with large and often increasing number of moving objects, the database size can increase dramatically. Consequently, the backend DBMS must deploy scalable techniques to deal with increasing data sizes, and increasing number of mobile objects. The key focus of the COMET project is on developing efficient and scalable methods for querying on past, present, and future locations of moving objects, and on scalable trigger mechanism in this environment. The expected results of this project may have a strong impact on emerging notification-based applications, such as emergency response systems, in which critical data needs to be disseminated to a physical mobile user based on the user's current and changing spatial location. The project will also train a number of graduate and undergraduate students. The project Web site (http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~jignesh/comet) will be used for making the COMET software, all developed applications, and real user movement data freely available to a broad research community."

Most of the volcanism associated with hotspots is thought to occur directly over the mantle hotspot constructing features Hawaiian, Canary, Society island chains. However, this main phase is commonly followed by a period of quiescence and then a secondary volcanic phase. Diamond Head volcano on O`ahu, Hawaii, is a textbook example of secondary volcanism. The cause of such late-stage volcanism remains an enigma. <br/><br/>This three-year project, funded jointly by the Divisions of Earth and Ocean Sciences, will examine the what (compositions), where (distribution and volumes), when (ages), and why (mechanisms) of secondary volcanism on and around the northern Hawaiian Islands. It is a coordinated land- and sea-based project with four main phases: (1) onshore mapping, sampling, and compilation of water well information to determine the volumes, ages and compositions of rejuvenated volcanism on Kaua`i and O`ahu. (2) A 28-day marine expedition to map the Kaua`i and Ni`ihau submarine volcanic fields with multibeam bathymetry and acoustic imagery, and to sample many of its volcanoes using the JASON2 ROV to characterize the petrology, geochemistry (major & trace elements, and isotopes) and ages of these lavas. (3) Integration of these results with previous surveys and petrologic/geochemical studies to establish a quantitative database for Hawaiian volcanic evolution. (4) Geodynamic modeling of this database to evaluate mechanisms for secondary volcanism. A first-order objective will be to establish how the submarine form of volcanism relates in space, time, volume, and composition to the nearby main shield volcanoes and their associated onshore secondary volcanism. Results will feed numerical modeling efforts to test proposed origins of secondary volcanism such as small-scale mantle convection driven by thermal and/or compositional buoyancy. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed project include a K-12 interactive education program involving lesson-planning and interactive web activities with sciences classes throughout the state of Hawaii before, during and after our marine work. Also, we will mentor several graduate and undergraduate students on research projects. We will recruit underrepresented students in our research, give public lectures to school groups and the local community on Hawaiian volcanism, and gain a better understanding of the volcanic environment which impacts all life in Hawaii."

The most prevalent model for the formation of hotspots is the mantle plume model (stationary deep-mantle source) and, consequently, many previous studies have focused on classic plume locations. The PI will address the cause of the Newberry hotspot track in Oregon which cannot be the product of a stationary mantle source. The three end-member tectonic models for the formation of the Newberry hotspot are: (1) gravitational flow along the base of the continental lithosphere due to the edge of the craton or plume related material, (2) counterflow associated with subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate, and (3) progressive lithospheric faulting at the northern boundary of the Basin and Range. The preliminary seismic data suggest that there is no flow of mantle material along the length of the Newberry hotspot. Rather, E-W oriented shear wave splitting observations, oblique to the volcanic progression, are observed regionally. These observations suggest that either hypotheses (1) and (2) need modification or that lithospheric processes (hypothesis 3) exert the<br/>dominant control. The PI will utilize datasets from seven existing seismic networks to investigate lithospheric and asthenospheric structure in the region. Tomographic imaging of the mantle will integrate teleseismic body-wave traveltimes with local surface-wave constraints. The preliminary seismic anisotropy study will be extended to include more stations and the larger datasets that are becoming available. The ultimate goal of the proposal is to characterize the lithospheric and asthenospheric processes beneath the Newberry hotspot. These processes can then be used as a complementary hypothesis to the mantle plume model, in order to objectively evaluate other hotspots. The proposed analysis of the existing data sets in Oregon will provide a mechanism to optimize Earthscope resources through planning of future experiments to coincide with the<br/>presence of the USArray transportable array and the arrival of PBO equipment in the region."

In turn, these studies will help farmers, breeders and producers nationwide by development of improved diagnostics, resistant plant varieties, and better control measures.<br/><br/>This project brings together biotechnologists, software engineers and biologists from throughout the United States to address an increasing threat to vegetable and legume productivity by developing a tractable model for molecular dissection of Phytophthora evolution, adaptation and virulence. The approach has potential to impact all future genome sequencing efforts and will provide an opportunity to benchmark an important sequencing technology platform. Because NCGR is located in the only minority-majority state and provides internships targeted to Hispanic and Native Americans, this project will provide opportunities in bioinformatics, computational biology, biotechnology and genomics to individuals from groups that are largely underrepresented in these scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>This project is being supported through a collaboration of the National Science Foundation and the National Research Initiative of the Cooperative Research, Education, and Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture."

The research tasks include investigation and development of efficient design methodologies, algorithms, and microarchitectures for the emerging nanotechnologies, including both nano-CMOS and technology candidates beyond CMOS. We plan to use nano-FPGA (nano-Field Programmable Gate Assembly) as an architecture/platform driver to explore various issues in nanotechnology designs. The regularity and reconfigurability makes nano-FPGA an ideal candidate to support the reliability and complexity requirements of designs in nanotechnologies. Based on this driver, we will explore novel techniques to achieve highly reliable and error-resilient designs to overcome likely defects and non-deterministic behavior of new nanodevices. The outcome of this research project will be innovative design methodologies, tools, and algorithms that enable efficient and economic design solutions for nanotechnologies as soon as they become available and practical. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) has identified nanoelectronics, one of the next generation of information technology devices, as one of nine ""Grand Challenge"" areas because of the potentially significant economic and societal impact of innovations in this area. While most innovations in nanotechnology at this stage are primarily at the level of individual devices, it is at the systems level where the true potential of nanotechnology can be realized. The rather unique focus of this project on design methodologies and systems-level issues, such as design of architectures, robustness, and error-resilience, will help accelerate the development of viable nanoelectronic systems. On the other hand, at this early stage, nanotechnology research requires extensive investment and is truly pre-competitive in nature, which makes it an ideal candidate for international collaboration so that we can leverage the global investment and coordinate research efforts in this area. Therefore, we will explore international collaboration opportunities with researchers and educators from leading universities in Taiwan, and China in this target area. In addition to research collaboration, we will initiate an educational program that will enable U.S. students and young researchers to visit the participating countries for workshops, joint research, student exchanges, etc. It will help them appreciate the culture, technology, and economic development of these regions, thus developing the scientific talents and social interaction skills required of future leaders with international vision and experience."

The goal of MIRAGE is to study the chemical and physical transformations of gaseous and aerosol pollutants in the outflow from Mexico City, currently the world's second largest metropolitan area. This project involves the fielding of an elastic lidar system and supporting equipment. The use of a mobile lidar will allow the characterization of the location, concentration, extent and persistence of the Mexico City plume as it transports into the surrounding regions. The mobility of the system will allow connections to be made between aerosols in one area and their sources upwind. These measurements will help to address issues relating to changes in aerosol size, shape and composition with time. The lidars will provide information on the height, backscatter and attenuation coefficients and relative density of aerosols in the atmosphere, as well as the height of the boundary layer, the entrainment parameter, and the amount, height and optical depth of cloud layers. Ultimately, the information this proposal will provide will be used to develop methods to mitigate the effects of emissions into the atmosphere. The project will provide valuable research experience to several graduate students."

Many countries are taking actions to enhance their technical and operational capabilities to monitor and control air quality and implement preventive actions to reduce the risks of air pollution. Air quality modeling is a cost effective tool to assess the current and future pollution estimations. One such tool is the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF)/Chemistry model, which has been developed as a state-of-the-art online modeling system. In this type of modeling system, the chemistry is integrated simultaneously with the meteorology, allowing feedback at each model time step both from meteorology to chemistry and from chemistry to meteorology. Currently WRF/Chem is completely embedded within the WRF Common Infrastructure (WRFCI). Options include several chemical mechanisms, aerosol modules, dry deposition, several options for biogenic emissions, and several options for photolysis (http://www.wrf-model.org/WG11). However, many scientific questions related to air chemistry may not need an ""online"" formulation. Similar arguments are given by operational centers who do not want to slow down their meteorological forecasts with cost intensive chemistry. Therefore, in this project, scientists from the Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in India in collaboration with US scientists (the PI from CIRES/FSL and the Co-PI from NCAR) will develop an 'offline' atmospheric chemistry model from WRF/Chem. The US scientists are directly involved in the WRF/Chem development in the United States. The Indian scientists will create the software design for the 'offline' WRF/Chem model. This includes capabilities - within the WRFCI - to read and process meteorological output from any of the available WRF cores and run only the chemical part of WRF/Chem without repeating the meteorological integration. In addition, the WRF/Chem model will be used by Indian scientists for pollution forecasting as well as addressing scientific questions related to air quality issues in India. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will should benefit both the United States and for India because of the provision of an excellent research and forecasting tool (the off-line model) to researchers and operational scientists and the likelihood of improved understanding and prediction of atmospheric air pollution.<br/><br/>This research is jointly funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Atmospheric Sciences."

Mountain glaciers are sensitive climatic indicators, and their fluctuations permit evaluation of several hypotheses regarding climatic changes in tropical, subtropical, mid-latitude, and sub-polar regions of both hemispheres. As additional chronological data constraining mountain glacier fluctuations are generated, particularly with increasing usage of cosmogenic and luminescence techniques, it is essential to design a) a conceptual framework for evaluating the temporal and spatial distribution of mountain glacier fluctuations and b) a community research plan to obtain critical data. The conceptual framework and research plan are the goals of the proposed workshop.<br/><br/>The workshop will consist of a three-day assembly in Beijing or Llasa as well as a three-day visit to field research sites on the Tibetan Plateau in May or September 2006. It will involve approximately 15 U.S. participants, including four graduate students, one undergraduate student, and one high school science teacher as well as 9-10 senior and junior researchers. The researchers represent at least nine U.S. universities and include members of underrepresented minorities. Researchers from the United Kingdom, Austria, India and New Zealand are expected to join those from the U.S. and China at the meeting.<br/><br/>Workshop results will be disseminated through an edited journal volume, archiving of the compiled data into a web database, and conference presentations. In addition, the high school teacher on the U.S. team will develop web-related materials of interest to high school teachers and students."

Previous research in these forests attributed a discrete change in forest composition at about 2,000 m elevation to the effects of historic fires. Such discrete shifts in vegetation in the face of gradually changing environmental factors are exceptional, and strong feedbacks between forest composition and the likelihood of fire were hypothesized. The recent fires present a powerful empirical test of this hypothesis and could provide quantitative evidence of the strength of these feedbacks. The extent and pattern of spread of the fires will be mapped using remote imagery. Based on a set of permanent plots that were established before the fires, field sampling of fire intensity and ground truthing of remote imagery will be conducted. Initial vegetation recovery from the fires also will be quantified. Understanding of the sensitivity of globally-threatened tropical montane cloud forests to changes in fire frequency accompanying future climate change should be improved by this proposed study. Important broader impacts of the research will include the training of undergraduate students and the participation in the research by Dominican National Park Service staff who serve as guides and field assistants."

Invasions of nonnative species not only have direct effects (competition, predation), but also indirect effects that cascade through food webs and into other ecosystems.  For example, recent research in Japan showed that the indirect effects of nonnative invading rainbow trout on stream food webs reduced the amount of adult aquatic insects emerging from the stream and caused a 65% decline in streamside spiders.  By extension, streamside birds also gain about 25% of their energy from emerging insects, so invading trout could affect them as well.  This project will study the effect of nonnative brook trout invasions in Rocky Mountain streams, an even more widespread invasion that affects thousands of stream miles.  This study will test whether these fish invaders have similar direct effects on native cutthroat trout as rainbow trout do on native fish in Japan.  It will also examine whether these effects propagate through the stream food web and reduce emerging aquatic insects that feed streamside spiders.  These effects will be measured directly and indirectly by using a stable isotope of nitrogen.  This work will be performed in stream sections where nonnative brook trout are removed and compared to those where they have invaded, and along a gradient from central to northern Rocky Mountain streams.  This study will have applied implications for the fisheries management of these stream systems.<br/>"

The general approach involves introducing collaborative lab experiences and team projects based on realistic applications, and to include cross-disciplinary and remote collaboration. Since today's undergraduates are increasingly familiar with technologies such as digital music, photography, and video from everyday life, early and pervasive connection to the technology can aid in understanding of fundamental theoretical concepts. Thus, the program will embrace cutting-edge technology, both in terms of exposure of students to applications and in the use of this technology in teaching. The specific plans impact the undergraduate curriculum at three levels: development of a new freshman introductory EE course, revision of an existing EE core course in signals and systems, and expansion of senior capstone design opportunities. Necessarily, the course developments will involve improvements to laboratory equipment used in teaching, as well as development of new course materials and teaching strategies. The proposed curriculum developments build on specific course material developed elsewhere, as well as results in the literature on collaborative learning. The evaluation of the proposed work with respect to the learning objectives and diversity goals will include both formative and summative efforts, including standard course evaluation forms, focus groups, attitude surveys, analysis of students' responses to specific exam questions, and quantitative analysis of inter-student classroom interactions, being conducted with assistance form the college's center for learning and teaching.

This is largely due to the difficulty of integrating molecular biological-based community composition measurements into an oceanographic measurement program, even though recent data imply that microbial diversity should strongly affect many biogeochemical processes. New developments in whole-community molecular fingerprinting approaches and high throughput sequence analysis make such integration possible. In this project, the PIs will evaluate microbial community diversity in the context of environmental data, as a critical first step toward relating molecular genetic data to processes that may be represented in conceptual and numerical models of the ocean. The project is very cost effective because no additional fieldwork is requested. Instead, the PIs will use existing high quality biological oceanographic data from predominantly subtropical or tropical regions. Samples come from the SW Pacific around Australia, the North Pacific from Hawaii to Empress Seamount, the W Tropical Atlantic including the Amazon Plume, the Gulf of Mexico on the West Florida Shelf, and the San Pedro Ocean Time Series between Los Angeles and Santa Catalina Island. Molecular and oceanographic data will be analyzed by multivariate statistical techniques including ordination, cluster, and canonical analysis. Questions to be addressed include: Do physico-chemical parameters structure microbial communities? Do some microbial taxa appear together regularly, and are some taxa mutually exclusive? Can correlations be used to connect certain taxa to specific biogeochemical processes? The project includes a significant exploratory component, and is expected to generate numerous specific hypotheses to test. The results will be digitally archived and can be integrated with new data on marine microbial diversity as it becomes available. Broader impacts of the project include a connection to K-12 teaching through USC's COSEE West program, undergraduate and graduate student teaching and research, and outreach to the general public through a website."

A potentially exacerbating factor to P-limitation is the presence of arsenate (AsO4=), an analog of phosphate (PO4=), that is present in relatively constant concentrations in these systems. As phosphate concentrations decline, the As:P increases, potentially making it difficult for phytoplankton and bacteria to acquire sufficient P required for growth. One mechanism used by phytoplankton to cope with As is the reduction of arsenate to arsenite and methylation to monomethyl and dimethyl arsenic. Under P stress or limitation, the differing abilities of phytoplankton species to detoxify As (arsenic stress) may influence the structure of the autotrophic community, as has been demonstrated in coastal waters. Thus, older paradigms of simple nutrient limitation control of primary production and autotrophic communities may need to be replaced by more intricate paradigms where non-essential, but bioactive, elements such as As may also be shown to profoundly influence autotrophic communities. <br/><br/>To define the linkage between the biogeochemistry of these two elements, and the role of As (and interactions with P) in the regulation of autotrophic communities in oceanic waters, scientists from the Smithsonian Institution and the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography will conduct a series of laboratory experiments using cultured isolates. The exact chemical and biological conditions and rates under which arsenite and methyl arsenic are produced, and their subsequent degradation rates and mechanisms, will be quantified to calculate their residence times, and hence periods of P stress integration. This research will also explore development of arsenite and methyl arsenic as tracers of phosphorus stress or limitation on a variety of temporal and spatial scales. A suite of cultured isolates representing several important members of the phytoplankton community (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, larger eukaryotes) will be tested for resistance to As as a function of the As/P/N ratio. These cultures will be kept very dilute, with low nutrient concentrations, so growth of each species will be followed using flow cytometry. Another aim of this study is to confirm the hypothesis that cyanobacteria are more resistant to high As:P ratios than eukaryotic species. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the research include fostering improved understanding of a potentially crucial factor, As, that phytoplankton and bacteria in large sectors of the open ocean must contend with to acquire a limiting nutrient, phosphorus. Additionally, the PIs will mentor minority undergraduate students and train graduate students in the latest techniques in culturing delicate marine plankton."

We are motivated by the vision of providing support for communication, monitoring, and surveillance over areas that lack the infrastructure for traditional computation and communication (e.g. protection and monitoring for large geographical areas such as the Alaska pipeline). By deploying a sensor network along such areas (using humans or flying drones) one can maintain a global view of key attributes of the environment. This research focuses on the following three goals within the broad area of synergy between communication and mobility in sensor networks: 1. Deployment - Distributed algorithms for mobility-assisted network deployment with desired topological properties, 2. Mobility-based Topology Control - Distributed algorithms for adaptive self-organization of the network nodes to support desired information flow, and 3. Link-level Communication Modeling - the development and analysis of a suite of localized algorithms that monitor the connectivity properties of the network locally and give global link characterization for the entire network. We expect this research to impact the deployment and maintenance of real-world sensor-actuator networks in the future via a deep understanding of the fundamental problems outlined above. The educational impact of the project will be the creation of a multi-purpose teaching module using the experimental systems developed in the proposed research."

In the 2004 - 2005 Austral summer, two rather extraordinary circumstances combined: 1) The extent of fast ice in McMurdo Sound exceeded 100 nautical miles - more than double the extent ever seen before, and 2) One of the two Coast Guard vessels able to break a channel to USAP's McMurdo Station was not able to sail due to mechanical difficulties. The Coast Guard and the NSF Office of Polar Programs determined that if only one icebreaker were used, the risk to the USAP would be too great. A worldwide search for an available icebreaker was conducted. This search resulted in the charter of the Russian icebreaker, KRASIN from the Far East Shipping Company (FESCO). The KRASIN is a very capable icebreaker and the largest conventionally powered icebreaker in the Russian fleet. Again, in the 2005 - 2006 Austral summer the USAP is faced with an identical situation. The ice is extensive and only one USCG POLAR class vessel is available. After another worldwide search the KRASIN was offered by FESCO. For the coming year KRASIN will be the lead icebreaker and POLAR STAR will be held in ready reserve to assist if necessary. In order to confirm the availability of the KRASIN, NSF and FESCO have mutually agreed to sign charter in fiscal year 2005 with a $1.00 obligation. The estimated obligation for FY06 is $7,200,000. The actual amount will be adjusted pending actual schedule and fuel consumed."

However, it has so far been difficult to find and compare hypotheses about genetic relationships, since they exist only in scholarly books and papers, and can only be accessed individually. The Multi-tree project will develop a digital library of scholarly hypotheses about language relationships, one which is fully documented and transparently traceable to the scholarly work upon which it is based. Hypotheses about groups of related languages will be displayed graphically as familiar diagrams of family trees, with each node opening to display additional information on the language or subgrouping represented. Moreover, competing hypotheses about the same language family will be displayed as two or more trees aligned side by side for easy comparison. The Multi-Tree database will also be integrated with the existing LINGUIST List databases, which house a wealth of information about language and linguistics collected over a 15-year period of building electronic infrastructure for the discipline. The Multi-Tree project thus has considerable potential to contribute to research and education both within the field of linguistics and in related scientific disciplines. The project will provide accessible data and an overview of language classification which can trigger new hypotheses. It will make relationships between lesser-known languages better known, stimulating research on minority languages. Finally, the online search facility will constitute a captivating instructional tool, for use in K-12 through graduate education."

However, a number of unresolved questions regarding the biogeochemical redox cycling of As and microbial pathways for arsenate, As(V), reduction remain to be answered. The proposed project will address the following unresolved questions:<br/>Question 1: In a given sediment environment, is in situ As(V) reduction related to detoxification or energy acquisition pathways? What factors induce these pathways?<br/>Question 2: Under environmental conditions and at environmentally-relevant As concentrations, what are in situ rates of As(V) reduction and what factors limit these rates?<br/>Question 3: How do the varying microbial capacities (i.e., iron (Fe)(III), and/or As(V) reducing activity) influence the mobilization of As from solid phases?<br/> The proposed project will combine molecular biological and geochemical approaches to interrogate microbial redox cycling of As and its coupling with Fe cycling at field sites with natural, geothermal As inputs. Factors influencing in situ rates of As(V) reduction will be examined and the conditions that trigger this process will be identified. Molecular tools will be employed to track abundance and expression of genes involved in As(V) reduction in situ.<br/> Specifically, Question 1 will be addressed by determining the environmental conditions that affect the gene expression for the two main pathways for As(V) reduction: respiratory (arrA) and detoxification (arsC). The bacterium, Shewanella sp. str. ANA-3, which is amenable to genetic manipulation will serve as our model organism for these studies. Field studies will focus on the development and application of molecular biological techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to track and monitor the expression of arrA and arsC in environmental samples. Question 2 will be addressed by introducing hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) pre-equilibrated with As(V) into the ambient sediment environment using a novel gel probe in which the HFO suspension is immobilized in a highly porous gel. Withdrawal of the gels over time and analysis of the oxidation state of As associated with the HFO suspension will allow us to determine the timescale for As(V) reduction in situ. Sediment incubation experiments will also be performed to determine how As(V) reduction rates respond to changes in, for example, organic carbon substrates. We will address Question 3 by examining As mobilization from natural sediments and model solids by mutants of ANA-3 that are deficient in one or more of the genes for Fe(III) reduction and/or As(V) reduction by respiratory and/or detoxification pathways. <br/> The results of the proposed project will substantially increase our understanding of the fundamental biological and geochemical processes that influence the occurrence and mobility of As in the subsurface environment. The project will contribute to development of the science base for prediction and mitigation of human exposure to As, which is a major health issue world-wide. The proposed project will also support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, who will be exposed to a wide range of experimental methods and who will develop the skills needed to pursue interdisciplinary environmental research."

The proposed work stems from recent innovations at UCLA on the role of feedback control in the<br/>game theoretic framework of distributed learning. This recent work has overcome long standing perceived<br/>obstacles in game theoretic learning and opens new opportunities for distributed system design.<br/>The proposed research will emphasize underlying mathematical models of multiagent learning. The<br/>research directions to be explored are:<br/>Advanced analysis of feedback control based learning in games: The introduction of feedback control<br/>methods in learning in games is very recent, and there are many important unresolved issues. Proposed<br/>topics of interest include strategic advantage of feedback control based methods, analysis of systems with<br/>heterogeneous learning algorithms, dynamic network interconnections, and supervised switching for learning.<br/>Continuum action spaces: The learning in games framework currently applies to learning among a finite<br/>set of choices. This direction involves learning with decisions over a continuum, such as dynamic resource<br/>allocation problems. Issues include new feedback control based approaches to distributed optimization,<br/>severely limited information structures, and complementary sharing of information structures.<br/>Multiagent games with state evolution: The learning in games framework uses a static game setup.<br/>The state variable is the state of learning, but not inherent states of subsystems or the environment. This<br/>direction considers learning for games with internal states, also known as Markov or stochastic games. Issues<br/>include changes of time-scale for expert selection, feedback control based Q-learning, and integrator action.<br/>Application to Evolvable Hardware: Evolvable hardware is an emerging area that uses notions inspired<br/>by biological evolution for the design of reconfigurable, self-organizing hardware. The proposed concepts on<br/>multiagent may be viewed as an engineered evolution with its blending of feedback control and multiagent<br/>learning. This project will use the evolvable hardware paradigm to illustrate and motivate the proposed<br/>research.<br/>Intellectual Merit: There is an extensive body of research in the area of multiple player games. In the case<br/>of non-zero-sum games, the concept of mixed strategy (i.e, randomized) Nash equilibrium, despite its central<br/>role, has received considerable scrutiny as to how players, through repeated interactions, would ever converge<br/>to a Nash equilibrium. Indeed there are long standing examples to the contrary. The innovative basis of<br/>the proposed research establishes that simple notions from feedback control can enable such convergence.<br/>Consequentially, this research opens many new possibilities into how to design distributed adaptive systems<br/>from a game theoretic viewpoint.<br/>Broader Impact: The proposed research will have a broader impact on societal applications and undergraduate<br/>student eduction.<br/>Societal: The distributed systems concept is relevant in a multitude of domains, both engineered and<br/>social. These include data networks, distributed robotics, traffic networks, distributed design, power grid<br/>infrastructure, and distributed computation, as well as economic exchange, social exchange, and political<br/>coalition dynamics. The proposed work addresses a fundamental component of the mathematical models of<br/>such systems and has potential implications in a variety of areas.<br/>Educational: Key activities to be undertaken are 1) Introducing 1-unit freshman courses on the concept<br/>of distributed systems and feedback control and their applications. This is through UCLA's Fiat Lux<br/>freshman seminar series, and 2) Developing an research test-bed based on evolvable hardware as a venue to<br/>incorporate undergraduate research-level participation through directed study electives.

The optical system will implement three pulse echo peak shift spectroscopy (3PEPS), a four-wave mixing method that has proven useful for measuring the spectrum of fluctuations of cofactor-containing proteins.

This collaborative work brings together the expertise of an optical physicist, chemical engineer, and biophysicist, to develop instrumentation that will advance knowledge in biomolecular dynamics. This new instrumentation will stimulate broader application of powerful femtosecond nonlinear optical techniques to biochemical studies, and will further develop technologies with great promise in biological studies: multiphoton microscopy and microfluidics.

This focus on overlay functionality has left unanswered the single most critical question: What lies underneath?

First, there must be some means of information discovery and dissemination through with overlays learn about the underlying Internet; a so-called Information Plane. Second, elevating overlays to first-class objects places special emphasis on the coordinated assignment of complex collections of network resources (e.g., bandwidth, storage, computational cycles, shared information) to competing overlays in an economically coherent, computationally practical fashion. This requires an Economic Framework for resource allocation.  Third, there is a complementary question of how to define the basic unit of resource, and the challenges in the implementation of decisions made in resource allocation by means of Virtualization. Combined, these elements form the critical core of an operating environment for overlays; the necessary universal substructure for an overlay-enabled world. These three elements play a pivotal role in this research program: they are both a key objective (output), and at the same time, essential for building a scalable wide-area testbed that allows researchers to evaluate new ideas under real-world conditions.<br/>"

Ongoing research in the field of plant molecular biology has revealed the importance of the sterol-derived brassinosteroids, which are the only steroid hormones identified from plants thus far. In addition to brassinosteroids, plants contain a wide variety of sterol compounds whose biological functions are not understood. The long-term goal of the Schrick lab is to identify and characterize the components of putative sterol signaling pathways in plants. Candidate sterol-binding proteins include a family of homeodomain (HD) transcription factors having Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) lipid/sterol-binding domains. START domains, named after the mammalian cholesterol-binding StAR protein, are found in a variety of proteins across the eukaryotes, but have been studied in only a few cases from animals. Strikingly, START domains in combination with the HD DNA-binding motif are unique to plants. This project addresses the hypothesis that the START domain found in HD transcription factors binds to lipid/sterol ligands and that this interaction controls gene expression during development. Several members of the HD-START family from Arabidopsis, maize, and rice, have crucial roles in cell differentiation and/or exhibit layer-specific expression patterns. Using the Arabidopsis thaliana Meristem Layer 1 (ATML1) and GLABRA2 (GL2) genes as models, the aim of this project will be to examine the putative role of START domains as lipid/sterol binding motifs. Potential ligands will be experimentally identified in a novel in vivo lipid/sterol-binding assay utilizing the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the assay the START domain is expressed as part of a synthetic transcription factor that activates a reporter gene in response to ligand binding. This assay will be implemented to test a chemical library of lipid/sterol compounds for binding to candidate START domains from Arabidopsis HD-START transcription factors, and additionally will be used for mutational analysis of selected START domains. Completion of this project will provide a conceptual framework for the presumed function of plant START domains in ligand binding, potentially revealing a link between lipid/sterol metabolism and cell differentiation in plants. Moreover, this work will result in significant advances in understanding of the role of HD-START transcription factors in plant development, and will lead to important insights underlying lipid/sterol signaling mechanisms. This research will have broader impacts through multidisciplinary education of graduate students as well as undergraduates, and the information gained from this research will facilitate improvements in plant-derived substances for practical applications in biotechnology."

This research is focused on understanding the multitude of critically important roles chromatin structure plays in normal development. In particular, the work focuses on a highly conserved group of proteins that form a complex whose main function is to regulate gene expression through direct effects on chromatin structure. This complex uses energy to alter the contacts between chromosomal DNA and histones (basic proteins that wrap DNA in the cell) to allow for specific changes in gene expression. This energy driven process is called 'chromatin remodeling'. When components of this complex are missing or mutated, cells lose the ability to properly control their fates and growth, leading to a variety of defects in proper body patterning and unregulated cellular proliferation. This project utilizes molecular genetics and biochemical assays to explore important connections between hormone signaling and chromatin remodeling during development. Hormone signaling directs the development of tissues to adopt certain fates. Using both classical and 'reverse' (making specific mutations in the genes under study) genetics and cell-culture based studies, the mechanisms are being defined by which hormone receptors select the genes they will regulate and how they cooperate with chromatin remodeling complexes to either turn genes on or off in response to the presence of hormone signals. Genetic interactions are being examined between genes important for hormone signaling and the genes that help convey those signals to the proper cellular targets. The genes important in this process are also being selectively silenced in cultured cells where it is possible to directly address how the chromatin remodeling complexes help to determine whether certain genes will be activated or repressed. <br/>The project utilizes molecular, genetic and biochemical analyses of the Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly) Brahma (Brm) chromatin remodeling complex. Research efforts are primarily focused on one of the most highly conserved and critically important components, known as SNR1. This subunit is crucial in both flies and humans for coordinating or targeting specific protein interactions between the complex and a variety of transcription factors and cell cycle regulatory proteins. The broader scientific impacts of these studies are: (1) teaching and training of graduate and undergraduate students in fundamental concepts of systems biology, including molecular genetics, biochemistry, and bioinformatics/structural biology; and (2) a better understanding of the functional relationships among subunits of a large and extremely important chromatin remodeling complex. This project also provides new insights into the biological significance of chromatin remodeling in normal developmental processes, including hormone-dependent gene regulation and control of cell growth."

Washington. Seagliders have collected data on sections from the continental shelf edge offshore 220 km at fortnightly intervals, reporting back data after each dive, on deployments typically lasting 4-5 months. The objective of the observations has been to detect seasonal and inter-annual variability in this part of the California Current system by collecting highly spatially and temporally resolved observations. Using Seagliders makes possible extended high resolution observations that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive if carried out by ships. This three-year project will: 1) analyze more than 16 months of Seaglider observations already collected, 2) continue the Seaglider observational program to over the continental shelf, and 3) analyze the newly collected data to describe the seasonal and interannual structure of the northern California Current system. Extension in time over the existing Seaglider repeat transects is necessary to confidently describe seasonal and interannual variability in the Cascadia slope region and to resolve and understand the (primarily advective) processes that are responsible for this variability. The data in hand offer tantalizing hints at the low frequency variability, but the 1.5 year record along two cross-slope sections is too limited to support quantitative understanding.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The results from this project will improve physical and biological understanding of climate change. By autonomously measuring important oceanographic parameters over a sustained period of time, it will be possible to establish an unprecedented climate record in an economically important area. By expanding the spatial coverage of the autonomous transects, we will be able to resolve and understand the contribution of advection. The results of this project will benefit resource planners by helping to understand the coastal zone ecosystem and influences of large scale ocean circulation on coastal and estuarine conditions in the Pacific Northwest. We will continue our outreach activities with presentations to local schools, open houses, public talks, and contacts with print and electronic media on local, national and international levels."

The liquid crystalline structure manifests itself not only through the bulk properties of the<br/>dispersed phase, but also (and sometimes primarily) through the impact of liquid crystallinity on the<br/>nanoscopic interfacial region and the interfacial properties. The proposed research addresses the effect of<br/>the liquid crystal/isotropic liquid interface on morphology and flow, particularly in smectic systems.<br/>Experimental. A bicontinuous gel-like liquid crystalline dispersion with nanoscale dimension is obtained<br/>when a minor phase of a smectic biphenylcarbonitrile (8CB) is mixed with poly(dimethyl siloxane). The<br/>gel is meta-stable through the nematic regime and then undergoes a spontaneous transition to a dispersed<br/>droplet morphology at the nematic-isotropic transition. The droplet morphology is meta-stable and does not<br/>reform to the gel with lowering of the temperature. We plan to carry out the following experiments, with a<br/>goal of developing an understanding of this remarkable kinetically-trapped system and placing the<br/>interfacial and bulk mechanics of the liquid crystal dispersion in the broader context of colloidal gels: (i)<br/>optical microscopy; (ii) nonlinear rheology and determination of the dynamics of the bicontinuous<br/>morphology; (iii) broadband dielectric experiments in the gel and droplet morphologies. The interfacial<br/>mechanics of the smectic phase in blends are essentially unknown. We plan to measure the interfacial<br/>tension of smectic 8CB against PDMS and to carry out a systematic study of droplet deformation and<br/>recovery for 8CB droplets in isotropic, nematic, and smectic regimes in a PDMS matrix.<br/>Theoretical. The mechanics are ultimately determined by the interplay between surface ordering and bulk<br/>stresses from the liquid crystalline orientational elasticity. We will employ a simulated annealing method to<br/>determine orientation distribution in the liquid crystalline phase. The mechanics of the gel-dispersed<br/>droplet transition in the 8CB/PDMS system seems to be a surface tension-driven phenomenon; the<br/>transition does not occur at the smectic-nematic transition because the system appears to be kinetically<br/>trapped in a meta-stable state, and a similar kinetic trapping appears to prevent a spontaneous morphology<br/>transformation to recover the liquid crystalline gel. We will study the mechanics of the interfacial tensiondriven transition between extended and spherical homeotropic liquid crystalline phases embedded in a<br/>viscous matrix.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the proposed activities<br/>Advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning.

The project -emphasis is on spectroscopic probes with sub-monolayer resolution that can be performed in real time during film growth and modification. Such real time probes will lend new physical insights into the mechanisms of film growth, the optical properties of solids and their interfaces, and the relationships between film growth processes and the resulting properties. The scientific studies will focus on the following three themes: (i) phase evolution in thin films; (ii) optical models of nanoscale, microscale, and macroscale structures; and (iii) the optical effects of interfaces and anisotropy in thin films. Such efforts represent the continuation of a long-term research program, starting with the development of two-parameter multichannel ellipsometry over a decade ago and culminating with the recent development of sixteen-parameter multichannel Mueller matrix spectroscopy. This research endows undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars with interdisciplinary skills in condensed matter, materials, and optical physics necessary for future positions in academia or industry. The project has great potential for transfer of technology and skilled researchers to industries developing thin film photovoltaics, optical and wear-resistant coatings, and semiconductor metrological instruments. <br/><br/>This research project is devoted to the development of thin films and their associated measurement tools for applications in science and technology. Thin films are applied onto the surfaces of materials in order to provide functionality at low cost, and are used in numerous technologies from microelectronics to electrical energy production. Research and development on thin films for such advanced applications are expedited by measurement tools that can determine the film thickness and other properties in real time, i.e., non-invasively during the fabrication process. In this project, such tools will be developed and applied to optimize thin film growth processes used by a variety of industries. These efforts represent the continuation of a long-term research program that began more than a decade ago and has provided new tools and optimum processes now being used extensively in academia and industry. This research project will educate undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars from diverse backgrounds who will acquire skills spanning a number of disciplines in materials research. The project will have great potential for transfer of technology and skilled researchers to industry, thereby enhancing the nation's science and technology infrastructure.

Thus, information about language boundaries and language relationships can provide critical insights into the migrations, interactions, cultures, and genetics of populations. However, such insights can only be realized in a system that melds language information with information from the physical and social sciences. The most effective way to do this is through a Geographical Information System (GIS), which can flexibly organize a wide range of heterogeneous data, presenting the assembled information according to the topography of geographical regions. This allows language data to be integrated with geographical, political, demographic, zoological, botanical and archaeological data in ways which are immediately visually interpretable. <br/><br/>The LL-MAP project will build a database of linguistic information which is integrated into such a geographically-based system and is made freely available through Internet-based tools. These will allow users to generate customized maps showing the relationships between language and diverse kinds of non-linguistic data. They will also allow researchers to add annotations to map-oriented data, and to discuss the relationships the system manifests. In this way LL-MAP will encourage collaboration between linguists, historians, archaeologists, ethnographers and geneticists, as they explore the relationships between language and cultural adaptation and change. The integrated data approach embodied in LL-MAP will thus promote innovative research methods, and these in turn may lead to new insights into the prehistoric relationships among human populations."

Kaplan, Anthony K. Aufdenkampe, J. Denis Newbold, Robert H. Findlay, and Peggy H. Ostrom<br/><br/>Naturally occurring organic molecules dissolved in water constitute the largest pool of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems. Within streams and rivers, molecules that originate in terrestrial vegetation and are modified within soils and groundwater by microorganisms during movement to the channel, are the dominant source of organic matter. These terrestrially derived molecules in transport downstream contribute to the biologically useful chemical energy present in freshwater and coastal marine environments. Our research uses a novel application of stable isotopes to quantify those contributions throughout a drainage network, and we frame our investigations within the context of scaling rules that facilitate the transfer of information from one habitat or system to others. We will grow young deciduous trees in an atmosphere enriched with the stable isotope of carbon, harvest and compost the trees, and extract the compost to prepare a leachate of complex, microbially modified molecules, and follow the fate of those organic molecules in systems which range from small laboratory reactors to a 5th order stream. Combining scaling rules derived from the knowledge of how streams ""grow"" as they flow towards the ocean with scaling rules associated with nutrient uptake in streams, allows us to test hypotheses concerning how organic molecules are used for energy within a stream network. <br/><br/>This research has broad implications for the use of scaling rules in ecological studies and for the drinking water industry where organic molecules provide both nutrients for the unwanted growth of microorganisms in distribution systems and the building blocks for the carcinogenic byproducts of disinfection. Our approach also may provide a predictive tool that can be used to learn about the fate and transport of anthropogenic contaminants that are transported downstream through their association with naturally occurring organic molecules."

It quantifies their respective roles in the dynamics of countries' external deficits. The investigators constructed a disaggregated database of U.S. foreign assets and liabilities to obtain novel insights into the predictability of asset returns and exchange rates and the importance of valuation effects for the sustainability of external deficits. They will extend this work along three dimensions. First, they will do a similar analysis with other countries, contrasting large financially developed economies (UK, Japan) with small open economies (Canada) as well as emerging markets. Second, they will develop new theories of portfolio investment where international wealth transfers and predictable excess returns play a key role. Lastly, the investigators use their methodology to analyze fiscal adjustment. <br/><br/>The Intellectual Merit of this proposal is to further our understanding of how financial globalization affects the process of external adjustment. Traditional models focus on deficit countries restoring external balance through future changes in net exports. For the US, the investigators find that revaluations of foreign assets and liabilities are a quantitatively important -and stabilizing- channel as well. This research helps also identify important determinants of asset returns and currency movements. For the US exchange rate, the investigators' model outperforms the random walk out-of-sample from one quarter to four years. The proposal extends the empirical analysis in order to assess the importance and direction of valuation effects for other countries. The proposal also develops a class of general equilibrium dynamic models consistent with observed patterns of capital flows, asset prices, currency fluctuations and net exports. Those models feature home bias in equity and international wealth transfers, elements rarely incorporated in open economy models and yet crucial for realism. The proposed models allow the investigators to study the effect of demand and supply shocks or changes in portfolio preferences such as erosion of home bias or loss of international currency status on the capacity of countries to accumulate foreign debt. Finally the proposed activity extends our understanding of government debt dynamics by measuring the importance of valuation effects for fiscal adjustments.<br/><br/>The proposed activity has many Broader Impacts. First, the project provides a new perspective on the issue of current account sustainability by highlighting the role of capital gains and losses on gross foreign assets and liabilities. It provides a theoretically grounded measure of external imbalance and constructs a database to implement it. Initial results show that US external imbalances are currently smaller than in the mid 1980s. This fact alone is important for the policy debate. Second, the investigators' framework suggests that the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on external accounts operates inter alia through valuation effects via exchange rate changes. These effects play very differently in developed economies and in emerging markets where most liabilities are in dollars. They have implications for the choice of exchange rate regime. Third, predictability of the returns on net foreign asset positions and of the exchange rate has important consequences for financial markets, the design of effective economic policies, and hedging strategies for international businesses. Fourth, the proposed methodology can also be applied fruitfully to the analysis of other imbalances. The investigators propose to look at fiscal imbalances where valuation effects (via inflation) may be important. Finally the quarterly database of US foreign assets and liabilities at market value that the research team constructed has already raised the interest of other researchers and organizations (IMF, BIS). The NBER has asked them to participate in a special conference on G7 current account imbalances. They are planning to build similar databases for other industrialized as well as emerging countries. These data could be used for the testing of a wide array of open economy macroeconomic theories."

Tabular data are a staple product in disseminating data derived from confidential microdata that fuels social science research and informs policy decisions. As the amount of tabular data accumulates in public, and record linkage methodologies improve, so does the threat to our confidentiality and privacy. This project explores the practical questions: (1) What social science data, releasable from a table with small counts, will maintain confidentiality? and (2) Will the released data be useful for statistical inference? The methodological aspects of this research deal with complete and incomplete characterizations of probability distributions for k-way contingency tables using marginals, conditionals, and odds ratios, and tools from log-linear models, probability, directed acyclic graphs, and algebraic geometry. Complete specifications are associated with unique identification of the full joint distribution, i.e., full disclosure, with the maximum utility. Given observed partial information based on an arbitrary collection of conditionals and marginals, the bounds and distributions on the cell entries tell us what values the cells can take; thus can be used for risk and utility assessment. The bounds can be calculated via linear and integer programming. Tools from algebraic geometry can be used for the calculation of bounds and induction of distributions. This project evaluates the applicability and effectiveness of the current methodology for high-dimensional discrete data; it will study the disclosure risk and data utility of conditional and marginal releases in large often sparse tables. This research improves the current methodology by studying the effects of rounding of probability values when reporting tables of rates on sharpness of bounds. The project will start developing a broadly applicable theory for assessing distributions over the space of tables given observed partial information based on arbitrary collections of marginals and conditionals. New results in this area will advance the current frontier of statistical and computational theory by introducing and confirming new statistical models. <br/><br/>Until recently nothing was known about the effects on confidentiality of releasing tables of rates. Releasing conditional distributions for high-dimensional contingency tables could be useful for social science researchers assessing causal inference while still maintaining confidentiality. The results of this research will further the connections between statistical disclosure limitation, discrete multivariate statistical theory, and computational algebraic geometry. The project increases awareness of data privacy issues in both the statistics and social sciences research communities, promotes research on statistical disclosure limitation, and recruits young scholars to study new statistical methods applicable to social and behavioral sciences. This research provides government agencies and public health researchers with new tools for evaluating the safety and utility of high-dimensional tabular data releases. These tools and data releases complement current dissemination practices of public use data files, and offer more flexibility in sharing data and research results while maintaining confidentiality.

Transnational non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are an increasingly important ""organizational resource"" for helping people manage these concerns focusing as they do on such global issues as poverty alleviation, refugee flows, human rights, fair trade, environmental degradation, and broadening the participation of underrepresented citizens (e.g., women, disabled). In tackling these problems, transnational NGOs have exhibited a clear ability to foster collaboration among the various actors involved in global governance, but they have also contributed at times to increasing the level of conflict, depending on their mission, style, and the strategies they have employed. While the growing role that transnational NGOs play in globalization and democratization has come under increasing study, the factors contributing to their organizational effectiveness-or relative ineffectiveness--remain under investigated. This project studies what transnational NGOs are-how they are organized and how governance and leadership choices influence their effectiveness as agents of change. The project will complete a large-scale, systematic interview study of the leadership of such organizations at both the regional and international levels. The focus is on creating indicators and baseline data for scholars and the NGO community to use in understanding how such organizations are evolving, the nature of their leadership, their funding strategies, how they perceive issues of transparency and accountability, the ways in which they evaluate their organizations' impacts, the challenges they experience in working along side governments and international organizations, and the effects that they believe governments and international organizations are having on the nature of their activities. Most interview studies to date have been limited in scope and have often chosen to focus on examining a particular case where transnational NGOs have played a significant role. Moreover, the research has generally taken a particular theoretical perspective and not explored, as is done here, the conjunction between the various ways of viewing how transnational NGOs work as well as the conditions under which they may be more or less effective. The responses from the interviews will be converted into a database--the first of its kind on transnational NGOs--that provides the basis on which future studies can build. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. This project furthers research, education, and practice regarding transnational NGOs.

In humans, increasing evidence suggests that macroparasite (helminth) infections influence the susceptibility to and severity of microparasitic infections such as HIV and TB. However, much less is known about micro- and macroparasite interactions in wildlife, despite the high prevalence of co-infections in many natural systems. This research will examine interactions between gastrointestinal nematode infections and bovine tuberculosis in African buffalo at Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. Free-ranging TB-negative buffalo will be treated with a long-lasting anthelmintic drug in order to (1) test the effects of nematode removal on host susceptibility to TB infection by evaluating changes in host body condition and immunological parameters in response to treatment; and (2) determine the impact of treatment on TB transmission by comparing TB transmission rates in treated and untreated animals. By linking observed micro- and macroparasite infection patterns with underlying immunological, physiological and population dynamic mechanisms, this work will broaden understanding of the role parasite interactions play in the dynamics of infectious diseases in wildlife."

Current estimates suggest human activities have doubled the amount of biologically active nitrogen on a global basis, with agriculture accounting for 75 percent of the human-derived nitrogen. A complex set of environmental and socio-economic factors influence agricultural fertilizer management practices. Linkages among socioeconomic and ecological subsystems are recognized as crucial in efforts to pursue sustainable ecosystem management and improve nitrogen-use efficiency. Disconnections between human and natural subsystems must be addressed as well as disconnections within the component subsystems. Within the human realm, those who pollute do not pay the costs associated with resource degradation. Likewise, the biophysical system that has evolved as a result of high, input industrial agriculture is fraught with ecological disconnections. For example, uncoupling of carbon and nitrogen cycles is a defining trait of agricultural systems and is the root cause of the leakiness of these systems. On average, 45 percent to 55 percent of fertilizer nitrogen applied is lost to the environment. The goal of this research project is to understand how interactions among social and biophysical subsystems impact on carbon and nitrogen cycles in intensively managed agricultural landscapes at multiple scales. Specific objectives of the project are (1) to investigate how the human subsystem responds to the environmental consequences of carbon nitrogen uncoupling, (2) to evaluate the relationships between nitrogen leakiness, institutional capacity, and proximity to degraded aquatic resources, (3) to determine which policy changes are likely to be most effective in promoting more efficient nitrogen fertilizer-management practices, and (4) to model and simulate multi-scale interactions among policies, farm managers, and institutions as well as nitrogen losses across space and time. To understand how institutions respond to degradation of aquatic ecosystems, the investigators will compare the institutions and management approaches used in the Chesapeake Bay, where the negative impacts of excess nitrogen inputs are experienced more locally and by the farmers themselves, to those in the Midwest, where the negative impacts are much more remote. Research methods include field research, isotopic tracer studies, construction of mass balances at multiple scales, face-to-face interviews and surveys with stakeholders, geographical information systems, remote sensing, global positioning systems, statistical tools, systems modeling, and simulation.<br/><br/>This project has implications for coupled human-natural systems theory and methodology, social systems theory, and environmental policy. The theory of how the human and biophysical subsystems of managed landscapes is not well developed, particularly in the case of intensively managed, high-input agricultural systems. This research will enhance fundamental understanding of how social and ecosystem emergent properties mediate interactions among human and natural systems. In addition to using a synthetic interdisciplinary approach, the investigators will depart from a microeconomic model of social dynamics in which the aggregated behavior of individual actors is taken to represent social processes. They will focus primarily at the institutional level, where the social emergent properties govern the interactions between and social and natural subsystems. The project also will have practical outcomes of relevance to the development of agricultural and resource-management policy. This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems."

These would be developed in a mountain adjacent to that currently being mined, so would have access to all the infrastructure developed for the operating mine. The rock has been well characterized to a depth of 2500 mwe by a core drilling; it appears to be highly competent porphyritic granite with few fracture planes and little water.<br/><br/>The local community is strongly supportive of Henderson DUSEL, and this plays into the education and outreach plans of the collaboration. An existing outreach program, involving the Snowmass Area Large Time-coincidence Array (SALTA) would be one component of this outreach, although its impact would be expanded by involving regional high school students and teachers.

Thus, information about language boundaries and language relationships can provide critical insights into the migrations, interactions, cultures, and genetics of populations. However, such insights can only be realized in a system that melds language information with information from the physical and social sciences. The most effective way to do this is through a Geographical Information System (GIS), which can flexibly organize a wide range of heterogeneous data, presenting the assembled information according to the topography of geographical regions. This allows language data to be integrated with geographical, political, demographic, zoological, botanical and archaeological data in ways which are immediately visually interpretable. <br/><br/>The LL-MAP project will build a database of linguistic information which is integrated into such a geographically-based system and is made freely available through Internet-based tools. These will allow users to generate customized maps showing the relationships between language and diverse kinds of non-linguistic data. They will also allow researchers to add annotations to map-oriented data, and to discuss the relationships the system manifests. In this way LL-MAP will encourage collaboration between linguists, historians, archaeologists, ethnographers and geneticists, as they explore the relationships between language and cultural adaptation and change. The integrated data approach embodied in LL-MAP will thus promote innovative research methods, and these in turn may lead to new insights into the prehistoric relationships among human populations."

This technique promises to be a sensitive indicator of glacial erosion. Non-radiogenic Hf is contained in the mineral zircon, which can only be released by the abrasive grinding that accompanies glacial erosion.

While this is true of all marine mammals, variation in the physical and biological environmental is particularly profound in the Southern Ocean. A basic understanding of the foraging behavior and habitat utilization of pelagic predators requires knowledge of this spatial and temporal variation, coupled with information of how they respond to these changes. Current understanding of these associations is primarily limited to population level studies where animal abundance has been correlated with oceanography. Although these studies are informative, they cannot provide insights into the strategies employed by individual animals nor can they provide insights into the spatial or temporal course of these interactions. <br/><br/>Recent technological advances in instrumentation make it possible to extend an understanding beyond the simple linkage of prey and predator distributions with environmental features. The key to understanding the processes that lead to high predator abundance is the identification of the specific foraging behaviors associated with different features of the water column. This study will accomplish these objectives by combining accurate positional data, measures of diving and foraging behavior, animal-derived water-column temperature and salinity data, and available oceanographic data. This project will examine the foraging behavior and habitat utilization of two species of contrasting foraging ecology, the southern elephant seal, Mirounga leonina, and the crabeater seal, Lobodon carcinophagus in the Western Antarctic Peninsula, a region of strong environmental gradients. Although these two species are phylogenetically related, they utilize substantially different but adjacent habitat types. Southern elephant seals are predominantly pelagic, moving throughout the southern ocean, venturing occasionally into the seasonal pack ice whereas crabeater seals range throughout the seasonal pack ice, venturing occasionally into open water. The relationship of specific foraging behaviors and animal movement patterns to oceanographic and bathymetric features develop and test models of the importance of these features in defining habitat use will be determined along with a comparison of how individuals of each species respond to annual variability in the marine environment. The physical oceanography of the Southern Ocean is inherently complex as are the biological processes that are intrinsically linked to oceanographic processes. Significant resources are currently being directed toward developing mathematical models of physical oceanographic processes with the goals of better understanding the role that the Southern Ocean plays in global climate processes, predicting the responses of ocean and global scale processes to climate change, and understanding the linkages between physical and biological oceanographic processes. These efforts have been limited by the scarcity of oceanographic data in the region, especially at high latitudes in the winter months. This study will provide new and significant oceanographic data on temperature and salinity profiles in to further the understanding of the dynamics of the upper water column of west Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf waters. Outreach activities include website development and an association with a marine education program at the Monterrey Bay Aquarium Research Institute."

This is one of the first order problems identified by the ""Geochemical Earth Reference Model"" (GERM) initiative, and by the ""subduction factory"" focus of the NSF ""MARGINS"" initiative. One way to study this problem is to examine outcrops of lithospheric mantle that underlie crust known to have formed by magmatism above a subduction zone. This mantle represents, in part, the source from which the overlying crust was extracted, and its mineralogy and composition reflect the processes that have affected it through time, including melt extraction, fluid phase enrichment, and subsequent interactions with melt derived from lower in the mantle. The primary advantage of this approach is that large tracts of supra-subduction lithosphere are commonly exposed at the base of many ophiolites, allowing us to examine their composition directly and on larger length scales than is currently possible in any active system. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the geochemical flux preserved in lithospheric mantle above the proto-Franciscan subduction zone, as represented by harzburgite and dunite tectonites that underlie the Coast Range ophiolite of California. The goal is constrain the nature and extent of these fluxes, as documented by whole rock major element and trace element analyses, by mineral analyses using electron and ion beam techniques, and by isotopic analyses of ultra-pure, hand-picked mineral separates. Major questions we will pose include the cumulative extent of melt extraction and the nature of the melt extracted, the nature, source, and extent of fluid flux to the mantle in the SSZ wedge, and the nature and extent of mantle-melt interactions subsequent to melt extraction (e.g., addition of melt from sub-lithospheric sources, or reaction of this melt with the previously depleted peridotites). <br/><br/>The geochemical evolution of the source region for island arc volcanics is an important problem with implications not only for the chemical budget of the Earth, but also for the origin of ore deposits that are commonly associated with island arc volcanism, the transfer of volatile elements from inside the Earth into the atmosphere, and the time scales over which these processes occur. While volcanoes are found on many terrestrial planets, plate tectonics and arc volcanism are unique to Earth and represent an important component of planetary evolution."

In textbooks this interaction is handled by using the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), which allows scientists to consider the slow-moving atoms to be frozen in space in their average positions while the more energetic electrons do their thing. But a multitude of important chemical, physical, and biological phenomena are driven by violations of the BOA. Breakdown in the BOA results from low-energy excitations of the electrons near what is known as the Fermi energy coupling with vibrational excitations of the solid. The resulting vibronic interactions are a necessary ingredient in any process that makes or breaks a covalent bond or in conventional superconductivity, which is driven by the electron-lattice interaction. Many of the emergent properties of complex materials or artificially nanostructured materials result from coupling of the electronic and lattice (atom) motion in systems that are inherently anisotropic.

We will build upon and integrate well developed and widely used computational infrastructures and emerging standards, including Cactus, Triana, and grid services. By using very powerful application development tools that have already demonstrated advanced DDDAS capabilities, we are able to concentrate efforts on developing specific DDDAS algorithms and software modules that will apply not only to ecological and coastal modeling, but many other applications. The project will address scientific problems of particular interest to NOAA, involving scenarios that couple ocean circulation, storm surge, and wave generation models for the Gulf, as well as ecological, hydrodynamic, and sediment transport models of the Mississippi River Delta region of Louisiana, and will develop infrastructure and algorithms that enable these models to be coupled, both to each other and to external inputs from sensors, wind, and other data, and databases to optimize execution of complex workflows on grids, invoking appropriate models, meshes, and algorithms, depending on current conditions. The real time coupling of input data and complex workflows will allow, for example, dynamically invoking more accurate models and algorithms as a hurricane approaches the coast, choosing appropriate computing resources, comparing model results with actual observations, coupling freshwater control diversions with storm surge models to reduce hurricane damage and flooding, or guiding placement of future sensors and dams. In the course of this coastal modeling project, we will develop toolkits to facilitate DDDAS scenarios by enabling functionalities such as wrapping legacy codes, integrating framework support for advanced codes that allow dynamic composition of data as it becomes available, running multi scale simulations, and adapting to current conditions by dynamically recomposing if necessary."

At the core of the proposed systems is the adaptive-feedback control of mathematical and computational models based on a posteriori estimates of errors in key quantities of interest, and modern Magnetic Resonance Temperature Imaging (MRTI) and diode laser devices to monitor treatment of tumors in laboratory animals. This approach enables an automated systematic model selection process based on acceptance criteria determined a priori and is valid for models of events occurring at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The proposed project should be of interest to both NIH/NLM and NSF. The methodologies to be implemented involve uncertainty quantification methods designed to provide an innovative, data-driven, patient-specific approach to effective cancer treatment. The general mathematical framework resulting from this research will be applicable to any thermo-therapeutic cancer treatment, but our treatment protocols will be established based on tumors seeded in prostates of canines. The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop treatment strategies by selecting optimal parameter sets (such as laser power, wave length, and fluence rate) based on high fidelity model predictions and data from cellular and in vivo biological measurement, and MRTI thermal distributions.<br/><br/>"

These systems under development are based on a radically new wireless-communications paradigm: the analog wireless signal is converted directly to the digital domain at RF frequencies. Wideband superconducting digital-RF hardware will result in extremely robust systems, with revolutionary new opportunities for handling complex waveforms (e.g. the Wideband Networking Waveform).<br/><br/>Astronomers need compact spectrometers to study sources such as planetary atmospheres, molecular clouds, and extragalactic objects. Distant sources have very small signals that are red-shifted by as much as tens of GHz. Therefore, spectrometer bandwidth and sensitivity must be better than present instruments offer.

Taylor, Teresa Seeman, and Alison Moore<br/>University of California, Los Angeles<br/><br/>In threatening times, people seek positive social contacts, because relationships provide protection to maintain personal safety and that of offspring. This ""tend-and-befriend"" account of social responses to stress is the basis for our work. Our previous research has found that oxytocin is implicated in social responses to stress, especially in women. The present work, tests the idea that oxytocin acts as a social thermostat that is responsive to adequacy of social relations, which prompts people to seek social contact if relationships fall below an adequate level, and which reduces biological and psychological stress responses, once positive social contacts are reestablished. Vasopressin, a hormone very similar to oxytocin, has been tied to male social behavior under stress in animal studies, and so the research also includes men to test whether vasopressin and/or oxytocin modulate men's responses to stress. <br/>One-hundred-eighty healthy young adults will be recruited for a study of social responses to stress. Through questionnaires and a daily diary, satisfaction with social contacts will be measured to see whether gaps in social relationships are associated with elevated oxytocin. Participants then complete stressful tasks in the laboratory in the presence of a supportive audience, a hostile audience, or no audience. Heart rate, blood pressure, and cortisol are assessed at multiple times during the stress protocol. Oxytocin will be related to information about relationships and to biological stress responses during the stress tasks. This research represents the first test of a biosocial process proposed to underlie human social responses to threats and the stress-reducing effects of social contact. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the work stems from its multidisciplinary approach to understanding why people seek social contact in times of stress and why those contacts have such clear benefits for psychological adjustment and health. There currently exists a profound gender gap in stress studies, with men substantially. Thus, the broader impact of the work also stems from its exploration of sex differences in social responses to threat and their biological underpinnings. Previous work by the researchers on this ""tend-and-befriend"" approach to stress has not only influenced current directions in stress research, but has also made its way into the public consciousness through hundreds of media portrayals that detail the significant benefits of social contacts under stress."

A major goal of the 2010 program is to understand how each of these genes function during plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic cues. Global studies to analyze gene and protein function have largely focused on gene expression, gene disruption, protein interactions and protein localization. To elucidate biochemical activities of the proteome at the global scale, this project will continue to develop a protein chip for Arabidopsis. In the pilot project funded by NSF 2010 program, high throughput techniques for cloning and expression of 1000 Arabidopsis ORFs were optimized to produce high quality active proteins for the generation of an Arabidopsis protein chip. In this project, a collection of expression clones for 4,000 predicted Arabidopsis ORFs will be generated for tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag fusions. These proteins will be expressed in the plant-based transient expression system to produce and purify proteins. The proteins will be printed on various printing surfaces to produce protein microarrays, which will then be used to optimize protocols for analysis of protein activities. The reagents generated will be made available to the entire scientific community and the information will be available through our website (http://www.gersteinlab.org/proj/atpchip/).<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will provide a valuable resource for a variety of applications aimed at the high-throughput study of protein function in Arabidopsis. The project will generate a suite of protocols specific to plant proteomes and generate a resourceful set of plant expression clones and other reagents that are expected to significantly enhance the analysis of protein function in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the methods developed and information gained from this study can also be directly applied to the analysis of other agriculturally and horticultural plants. In addition to generating a community resource, the project provides the unique opportunity to elevate the awareness and importance of genomics and proteomics to a wide range of individuals including visiting scholars from around the world, educators from small colleges, public secondary school teachers in and around the New Haven area and under represented students at the undergraduate and graduate level. Specifically, participation in Yale University STARS program will provide opportunities for under represented students to conduct cutting edge research in proteomics lab."

Although much research has characterized synthetic organic actuation at relatively large scales, it is highly desirable to reduce the size of present actuators to allow direct interaction with certain biological systems and facilitate integration with emerging nanosystems. Active polymer deformation at small scales would have applications in biology, medicine, and engineering. <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to investigate nanomechanics in advanced active polymer materials. The specific objectives are to: (1) Understand the fundamentals of nanometer-scale strain storage and recovery in shape memory polymers and liquid crystal elastomers using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and imprint lithography experiments. (2) Resolve the physical phenomena in the storage and recovery of nanometer-scale strains in shape memory polymers and liquid crystal elastomers using molecular dynamics modeling. (3) Use the research program as a vehicle to create a unique and exciting educational opportunity for students at all levels to learn about nanoscience and nanotechnology.<br/><br/>The proposed research combines experimental and theoretical approaches and expertise in AFM, active polymers, and atomistic modeling. AFM impression experiments will be used to study the effects of deformation size-scale, temperature, and polymer structure on strain storage and recovery in shape memory polymers and light activated actuation in liquid crystal elastomers. Multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations will be used to ascertain operant deformation mechanisms in the materials and to help interpret results of AFM experiments. The experiments and simulations will be tightly coupled so experimental findings help to drive modeling studies and vice-versa. The research is driven by two technology test-beds; a nanopackage delivery system and an active biological scaffold. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the research lies in the first-ever measurements and modeling of mechanically active polymers at nanometer scales. The research achieves broad impact through a fundamental advancement in the understanding of active polymers that will aid polymer scientists and engineers at all length scales. The research is the necessary first step in the rational design of engineered biomimetic systems capable of nanometer-scale energy storage, processing, and delivery. The research emphasizes the participation, education, and training of elementary school and high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, who will all benefit from exposure to nanoscience and nanotechnology research."

It supports the development of a novel multiphoton microscope that will be capable of measuring biomolecular dynamics over 15 orders of magnitude in time. The microscope will use microfluidics technology to provide microsecond time-scale mixing, and low (ml/hour) sample consumption rates. Microsecond to second time scale delays will be achieved by using a microscope to probe the sample flow at increasing distances (corresponding to increasing time) along the outlet channel. The optical system will implement three pulse echo peak shift spectroscopy (3PEPS), a four-wave mixing method that has proven useful for measuring the spectrum of fluctuations of cofactor-containing proteins. The microscope will initially be employed in two lines of work: 1) studying the evolution of flexibility and heterogeneity during protein folding and 2) characterizing the dynamics of intermediate species in the photocycle of photoactive yellow protein. <br/><br/>Direct measurements of the molecular motions of biomolecules over a broad time range is crucial to furthering a microscopic understanding of biology. To fully appreciate the relation between molecular motions and biochemical events, the time scale over which molecular dynamics must be recorded is enormous - from femtoseconds (10-15 seconds) to seconds or even minutes. This collaborative work brings together the expertise of an optical physicist, chemical engineer, and biophysicist, to develop instrumentation that will advance knowledge in biomolecular dynamics. This new instrumentation will stimulate broader application of powerful femtosecond nonlinear optical techniques to biochemical studies, and will further develop technologies with great promise in biological studies: multiphoton microscopy and microfluidics. This research will benefit interdisciplinary biophysics education at the undergraduate and graduate levels by providing opportunities for students to work in multidisciplinary teams including molecular biologists, chemical engineers, and optical physicists."

Partially, this is because there has not been enough interdisciplinary study of criminals (particularly among sociologists and psychologists). Also, there has been an overuse of incarcerated offenders in much research with less attention paid to noninstitutionalized offenders (i.e., free on the street and currently offending). Such individuals may account for a large proportion of reported and unreported crime (particularly when they victimize other offenders). This 2-year project seeks to collect detailed qualitative and quantitative data on active, noninstitutionalized street offenders (drug dealers, street robbers, carjackers) from the streets of Atlanta GA to better understand their decision-making proclivities and psychological characteristics. First, participants (including active offenders, demographic controls, and college student controls) will engage in extensive, one-on-one interviews focusing on street crime, violence, and street culture. Subsequently, they will complete a battery of standardized questionnaires to provide a systematic understanding of offender criminal attitudes, subcultural beliefs, and offending propensities. The project will collect data on a group of individuals we know very little about, allowing us to link individual level factors with sociological, cultural, and contextual dynamics to help us understand criminal decision-making and behavior in the context of the urban street culture."

In the majority of the European countries and in North America tenants operate over 50% of farms. Latin American countries stand out for their limited use of tenancy, e.g., in Brazil tenants operate 10% of the farms. Historically this was not the case. Less than fifty years ago tenants operated a majority of the farms in some regions. The decline of tenancy has increased the pool of landless peasants, many of whom became squatters on public and private land. Squatting seems puzzling given the presence of considerable hectares of unused agricultural land. The puzzle is: why don't the landowners of the unused land rent to the landless. The project addresses this question and more broadly contributes to the understanding of the factors responsible for the decline in tenancy in Brazil. The research will also shed considerable light on contracting in other areas of Latin America. This project is being supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Economics Program.<br/><br/>The literature on tenancy is vast but the majority of explanations rest on transaction costs, e.g. asymmetric information and moral hazard, and risk. The investigators believe that these factors played a role in the fall in tenancy in Brazil but alone they are insufficient. They will contribute to the literature by testing for the importance of land conflict and land differentiation, including the marginalization of some land, in understanding the decline of agricultural tenancy in Brazil. Landlessness and land reform projects may reduce the desirability to land owners of renting land because they may fear that it will be too difficult to evict tenants if they are deficient in paying rent, given existing legislation ostensibly favoring tenants. Landowners may also be wary of renting for fear that it may target them for expropriation. By land differentiation we mean the rapid specialization that occurred in many agricultural regions partially as a result of the decline in transportation costs and the decline in trade barriers. Specialization marginalizes some land in the sense that some land may not be worth the opportunity cost of capital and the return to applying labor via a rental contract may be only subsistence and as such a potential landlord would opt to leave the land vacant or switch to pasture. Specialization for Brazil in some regions has led to a switch from labor intensive coffee to capital intensive soybeans. As a result, there was a rise in owner operated units and fall in tenant farming. In other areas of Brazil the decline in cotton and sugar and the switch to fruits and vegetables lead to a similar decline in tenancy.<br/><br/>Prior to testing econometrically the factors responsible for the decline in rentals, the investigators will produce analytical narratives of the economic history of agricultural contracting in 5 states in Brazil from 1950 to the present. The states represent different agricultural regions in Brazil and as such will have implications for the decline in rentals in other similar agricultural regions in Latin America. After understanding the agricultural conditions across states and over time the investigators will test for the importance of land differentiation and land conflict with county level data from agricultural censuses from 1950 to 1996. The Brazilian censuses are ideal for testing because they classify farms as being operated by owners, tenants, sharecroppers or squatters. They also collect data on ""unused but usable"" land which will allow us to further test for the impact of marginalization. The results of the research will have implications for land reform policies in Latin America and even more broadly worldwide. There are millions of rural landless in Latin America whose livelihood would be improved by producing for local markets and their own consumption. Depending on this project's results it may make policy sense for governments to target the marginalized lands either for purchase and redistribution, or for the government to guarantee renting without expropriation."

Research into how such coastlines evolve over spatial scales of kilometers to hundreds of kilometers and over time scales of decades and longer has just begun. Recent work has revealed surprising long-range interactions, with changes in one location directly affecting distant parts of the coastline. Human efforts to stabilize the shoreline position -- especially through artificial sand placement or ""beach nourishment"" -- are becoming increasingly prevalent, and these localized manipulations likely affect how entire coastlines evolve through their long-range as well as regional effects. This research project will incorporate human manipulations into an enhanced computer model of large-scale, long-term coastline change caused by wave-driven sediment transport. Addressing the behaviors of the fully coupled human-natural system will require developing a model that represents how humans respond to coastline changes, especially local shoreline erosion. Such a model will be based on (1) data that incorporates historical beach-nourishment decisions and economic variables; (2) economic theory;( 3) information gathered during a workshop involving coastal managers, engineers, policy makers, and stakeholders; and (4) scenarios of federal beach-nourishment subsidies, future expense of procuring beach-quality sand, and policy constraints arising from ecological concerns. The resulting coupled model will allow investigations of the types of coastline behaviors to be expected in coming decades and centuries in the context of likely climate change and the consequent changes in storm and wave patterns as well as accelerated sea-level-rise. The coastline of the Carolinas will be used as an initial case study to test the model.<br/><br/>Developing the social science component of the modeling endeavor will involve the first examination of how beach nourishment decisions are made. Experiments using the coupled human-coastline model will provide the first examination of how human-influenced coastlines evolve, and more specifically, how actions taken at one location are likely to affect other coastal communities in far-flung locations as well as nearby. The potential insights gained through this work could help coastal managers and planners avoid surprises arising from such spillover effects, which could be especially important as climate change and direct human manipulations become more important factors affecting coastline change. A dedicated website and targeted communications will facilitate dissemination of the main lessons to interested coastal planners and stakeholders. More broadly, this research will advance the embryonic science of human-landscape interactions, which are becoming ubiquitous across much of the Earth's surface.

The authors have developed a hybrid technique that overcomes the limitations of absolute plate motion and relative plate motion approaches. The new technique can be derived from either stationary or moving plumes. During this project the authors will further develop their APM modeling to address a broader range of questions, in particular hotspot motion. High-resolution APM models will be determined for the key plates Pacific, Africa, and Australia, both with and without hotspot motion. This will allow an assessment of the uniqueness of the APM models and to quantify plume drift within a group as well as between groups."

High throughput international backbones linking desktops of scientists around the world will help launch a new class of research collaborations with scientists ""wired together"" in a virtual, global, biodiversity collaboration environment.<br/><br/>To set the stage and prepare for this transformation in research communications among North and Central American countries, the workshop will include 40-50 invited leading biology researchers, cyberinfrastructure technologists, and funding agency representatives from the United States, Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, Colombia, and various other Central American countries. It will be focused on identifying activities that will enable North and Central American partnerships and collaborations. Outcomes will include recommendations for follow-on activities and suggestions for investments to promote international informatics collaboration. The broader impacts of the meeting will, ultimately, lead to new modes of collaboration, supporting biodiversity research and analysis for policy and planning, to better understand the ecological and societal impacts of global biodiversity. This workshop is being jointly supported by the Division of Environmental Biology, the Office of Cyberinfrastructure, and the Office of International Science and Engineering."

This proposal has also been submitted to NASA and will be jointly funded by OPP and NASA. The Principal Investigators will use geophysical field measurements and remote sensing to investigate the role of Greenland's supraglacial lakes in delivering melt water to the ice sheet's bed and in modulating ice flow on short time scales. Recent results demonstrate a correlation between ice velocity and surface melt draining through moulins to the bed, which may provide a mechanism for rapid response of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) to climate change. Supraglacial lakes are one of the critical links between surface melting and enhanced basal flow, have the potential to rapidly respond to future climate change, and are the focus of the research project described here.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The major result of this project will be significant new knowledge about the formation and dynamics of Greenland's supraglacial lakes and the role of surface melt and lake drainage in modulating ice sheet flow. Over the entire GIS, the project's results will provide the first clear understanding of where and why lakes form around Greenland, the total melt-water volume stored in these lakes, and their relationship to outlet glacier drainage basins. Over the dynamic and climatically sensitive Jakobshavn region, the results will show the interannual variability in lake systems and the available melt water flux from supraglacial lakes to the ice sheet's bed. These observations will be used to test emerging hypotheses concerning the role of supraglacial lakes in moulin formation. New observations of how local and regional climate control lake behavior will yield insight into the potential for lake systems to respond to future climate change. Ground-based measurements and experiments will: 1) allow account for the role of lake drainage in ice flow variability, 2) relate local climate controls to changing lake volume and moulin formation, and 3) provide better constraint on how models predict future ice sheet response to climate change. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Arctic change and Greenland's contribution to sea level rise is of great societal interest and concern. The results of this research will be disseminated to the public through ongoing Principal Investigator efforts including K-12 classroom visits, web sites, press interviews, and other opportunities. Results will be of immediate interest to scientists working to understand past and future changes to the GIS. They will present results in specialized journals and conferences, and will speak in departmental seminars that reach a broad cross-section of the earth science community. This research will contribute to the establishment of a new glaciological program at WHOI and to new collaborations at UW."

These include genome scale information (such as whole genome sequences, high resolution genetic and physical maps, etc), extensive phenotypic data sets (expression profiling, proteomics, and metabolic data sets, etc) genetic resources (mutation, recombinant inbred, and transgenic collections, etc.), functional genomics assets (including reporter-gene expression collections, high throughput deletion and RNAi sets, protein interaction surveys, etc.) and informatics resources (software tools, algorithms, databases, web sites, etc.). While each of these resources is quite useful individually, their highest value may lie in their use in combination and by those outside the groups that created the resource. The former requires creative synthesis - combining the information represented among these distinct resources in innovative ways to achieve a better understanding of fundamental principles in plant biology. The latter requires that individuals from other fields and disciplines be able to find, understand and effectively employ these resources in novel ways. Such innovative, synthetic approaches do not come 'off-the-shelf' and, instead, present a significant new challenge that can only be met by plant researchers/educators, information scientists, and others working together. This workshop brings together members of the relevant communities to consider whether the development of a plant science synthesis center could provide an effective means for meeting this challenge. Questions that workshop participants are addressing include the following:<br/>Is there a need for a plant science synthesis center?<br/> What would be the mission and goals of such a center?<br/> What mechanisms could a center use to respond to community needs and to<br/> promote progress through new synthesis and innovation?<br/><br/>The summary report of the workshop, describing the outcomes of the discussions, will be posted on the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) web site (http://www.arabidopsis.org/). The broader impacts of this workshop are substantial. The central goals are the identification of unmet needs and opportunities for progress across all areas of plant research and education, information and computer sciences, and enabling interdisciplinary research that engages individuals from all settings and perspectives and includes those outside the immediate field, including engineers, mathematicians, chemists, and others."

All of these microbes, whether beneficial or pathogenic (disease-causing), have developed mechanisms to neutralize the defense systems used by plants to protect themselves against infection. Understanding the similarities in the ways these diverse microbes attack plants will help us understand the vulnerabilities of plants to infection, which will in turn help design new and effective methods for controlling plant disease. Currently, genome projects focused on a variety of plant pathogenic microbes are uncovering large numbers of genes that the microbes may use to attack plants. However, because these genome projects are going on in different research communities, the terminology that is used to describe the functions of the genes varies so much that it is very difficult to compare the functions of genes in the different microbes. This project will establish a standardized set of terms, called a Gene Ontology, for describing the functions of genes used by microbes that live in or on plants, including pathogenic microbes. The work of establishing the terms will be carried out in collaboration with the Gene Ontology Consortium, which is a group of institutions involved in creating standardized terms for describing all the functions of genes in living organisms.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this work will be to establish a means for greatly facilitating the exchange of information among researchers studying plant-associated microbes. The work will also be of value to researchers studying animal- and human-microbe interactions. Members of many different research communities will be trained in the use of the standardized terms, through training workshops, internships, presentations at meetings, and on-line training documents. Training will emphasize graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty, especially those who are minorities, or are from undergraduate institutions. Information about the standardized terms will also be incorporated into courses for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project is being supported through a collaboration of the National Science Foundation and the National Research Initiative of the Cooperative Research, Education, and Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture."

With RDE (PPD)-DEI support<br/>over the past two years, we have expanded the Summer Biotechnology Program into a model program<br/>that fully integrates youths with disabilities into a genuine laboratory experience. Participants with and<br/>without disabilities work together in teams towards the common goals of learning and performing<br/>molecular biological techniques for recombinant protein synthesis, protein isolation, and protein<br/>purification. Students also work together to prepare and present a poster presentation for their parents,<br/>friends, and BUSM faculty members. SummerLab participants also discuss science career opportunities<br/>and tour local biotechnology companies such as Genzyme so that they can see how their experience at<br/>SummerLab might lead to future employment. This seminal experience serves as a basis for further<br/>laboratory science education through BUSM's CityLab Scholars and Academy programs.<br/>This RDE-FRI effort will enable us to continue to expand access to biotechnology and biological sciences<br/>for students with disabilities. We will continue to expand our summer and academic year laboratory<br/>experiences for students so that they can pursue advanced education at the undergraduate level. We will<br/>also expand the pipeline of students with disabilities who consider science education and careers by<br/>providing practical coursework and experience for science teachers who work with students with<br/>disabilities. We believe that by providing teachers with a mentored experience, they will be better able to<br/>encourage their students with disabilities to pursue science coursework.<br/>Intellectual Merit Criterion:<br/>The proposed program will provide physical (lab bench height, flexible seating without attached chairs,<br/>etc.) and material (large print for visually impaired youth, interpreter for hearing impaired youth, visual<br/>aids and note-takers for youth with brain injuries and learning disabilities) accommodations to facilitate<br/>career exploration. This program will further integrate the youth with disabilities so that the students with<br/>and without disabilities work together and learn from one another. Students who attend these programs<br/>will be encouraged to pursue additional science education, either at Boston University (through CityLab<br/>Academy and standard undergraduate science programs) or elsewhere. We will also seek to increase the<br/>number of science teachers who actively promote science careers as attainable goals for youth with<br/>disabilities. This program will also include on-going mentoring for both students and teachers to<br/>reinforce positive attitudes towards science. We will also evaluate student and teacher participants'<br/>attitudes towards science and science careers.<br/>Broader Impacts Criterion:<br/>Perhaps the most important characteristic of this proposal is that it opens doors for youth with disabilities<br/>who might not have had an opportunity to appreciate the tremendous career opportunities that are<br/>available in the sciences. There is a strong national interest in encouraging all students to pursue<br/>continued study of science and mathematics so that they have the requisite background to consider a<br/>science career. Students with disabilities are often particularly suited to pursue science because they<br/>possess the intellectual capacity to become independent thinkers, but often they (and their families and<br/>teachers) do not see the path to a science career. This program will provide a new pathway for students<br/>with disabilities to explore science careers and promises to build on CityLab's success in encouraging its<br/>students to pursue continued study of science. We will disseminate the materials and best practices that<br/>emerge from this project through conventional science education and disability networks."

Two such classes are applications that move between computing resources to exploit computational resources, and applications that migrate between servers to achieve resilience to hardware faults.  Both of these are instances of mobile applications in computational grids.  To achieve full mobility, applications must be able to move their state from one platform to another one that may have a different processor architecture (processorindependence) and a different number of processors (platform-independence).  The project will solve this problem using a combination of compiler technology and runtime systems.  The proposed solution is based on application-level checkpointing, an approach in which an application is instrumented so that it can save and restore its own state without any assistance from the operating system or architecture.  To achieve the goal of mechanism transparency, the proposed approaches employ compiler technology to automatically instrument codes in this way.   Experimental evaluation of the resulting system will be carried out jointly with the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC).  The proposed system will enable many existing parallel codes to be quickly and safely transformed into mobile applications."

Although buildings, bridges, nuclear power plants and like structures might not avoid catastrophic failure in extreme events, research needs to be carried out to protect critical structures. In the case of existing structures, a quick and effective way to achieve this goal is to use structural protection systems such as composite jackets. Previous applications of composite materials to civil structures were mainly focused on structural rehabilitation under fatigue or seismic loading (i.e., low strain rate situations). Systematic studies on improving structural survivability using composite materials and other protective materials under impact or blast loading condition (high strain rate situations) have received only preliminary attention. However, fundamental scientific groundwork is still significantly lacking. The goal of this proposal is to explore the fundamentals of dynamic failure mechanism and mechanics involved in improving structural survivability using protective systems, before these systems can be extensively applied to critical structures. This objective will be implemented through real-time, small-scale model <br/>experiments of dynamic failure incorporating dynamic fracture mechanics analysis. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activities is the identification of an interdisciplinary area of fundamental and practical importance. Complicated dynamic failure mechanism and mechanics can be extensively explored through carefully designed small-scale model experiments before these principles are applied to practical large-scale structures. The proposed activities will advance knowledge and understanding within the field of dynamic failure mechanics and across broader fields including composite materials and structural engineering. Since this project is focused on a highly visible research area of international importance to the general population, it is expected to lead to an immediate impact on society."

At the start of the millenium, the world's particle physicists arrived at a consensus that an ILC should be the next major facility for high-energy physics. Since then, candidate technologies for the accelerator were developed, the global community has agreed on the technology to be used and a global center to coordinate the completion of the design is now forming.  <br/><br/>Realizing the vision of the ILC will be a great challenge both technically and in timeliness. The technical challenges lie in both detector and accelerator areas and derive from the need for high luminosity and high precision of measurement. The timeliness challenge lies in the need to have significant overlap with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) if the full synergy of the two approaches to the energy frontier is to be achieved.  The physics goals of the ILC require a starting center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV, upgradeable to approximately 1 TeV or more, and a luminosity that is an ambitious four orders of magnitude larger than that achieved by the Stanford Linear Collider.  Achieving the high energy and ultra-low emittance of the ILC requires significant new advances in many areas of accelerator physics and technology, including beam simulation, beam diagnostics, radio-frequency structure development, and accelerator controls. This proposal addresses leading challenges in these areas, bringing to bear the talents of both experienced accelerator scientists and experimental physicists with expertise in instrumentation. In order to provide governments with a convincing design and cost estimate, in time for substantial overlap with the LHC, these accelerator challenges need to be addressed urgently. This proposal seeks to be a visible step towards that goal.<br/>This program will have scientific impact beyond the ILC. The accelerator physics R&D will push the state of the art in many areas (such as diagnostics) that have applications across the whole spectrum of accelerators. Benefits will accrue to the many other fields such as materials science, condensed matter physics, biophysics, and medical science, which utilize accelerators as their front-line research tools.  The collaborating groups have a strong history of outreach to undergraduates and K-12 students and teachers. The work supported by this proposal will be integrated into these outreach efforts. <br/>"

These systems are important because they significantly impact the carbon cycle and nutrient budgets in arid regions, and because they may be representative of early terrestrial biota before the rise of land plants. Biological soil crusts exist in an environment profoundly limited by the lack of water and nutrients, especially bioessential trace metals. We hypothesize that biological soil crusts maximize their retention of water and nutrients through the production of organic compounds. The soil crust community's mediation of organic compounds and the bioessential metals in the soil provides a fundamental biogeochemical link between microbes and earth-materials. Our experimental studies focus on the interactions of soil crust microbes with mineral substrates, and the nature and effects of the organic compounds produced and/or lost to the soil porewater on metabolically relevant metals. Our specific objectives are: 1) To characterize desert soil crust and the underlying soil mineralogy and geochemistry; 2) To compare crusted and uncrusted soil systems with respect to carbon and trace element composition; 3) To simulate rain events and assess changes in biological soil crust organic carbon production and metal distributions before, during and after water exposure. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry will be used to identify specific organic compounds directly from water samples, and ICP-mass spectrometry will be used to determine trace metal concentrations and distributions. This integration of organic biogeochemistry, trace element biogeochemistry, and geomicrobiology is quite unusual and our graduate and undergraduate students will gain unique trans-disciplinary research experience."

The investigators will continue their agenda of integrating psychologically more realistic assumptions about human behavior into formal economic models, to modify and improve economic theory in those areas where it is most importantly inaccurate.<br/><br/>This award funds research exploring the implications of self-control problems for the interplay between what consumers buy and when they buy it. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is that it helps to further delineate the implications of basic lessons from psychology for basic economics. Indeed, the investigators revisit a core domain of economic behavior - consumer choice under budget constraints - with one of the<br/>simplest and most successful models from the emerging behavioral-economics literature - selfcontrol problems modeled as a time-inconsistent taste for immediate gratification. The analysis of consumer choice is both a good place to empirically identify the nature of people's self-control problems, and a realm where self-control problems might have some of their most profound effects.<br/><br/>The research has two main thrusts. The first studies the relationship between prices, quantity purchased, and timing of purchases for unhealthy goods. In particular, self-control problems can lead to responses to non-linear prices or price variation that would not arise for those without self-control problems. For instance, consumers who don't fully anticipate their future selfcontrol problems may take insufficient advantage of low prices or bulk purchasing, and hence end up spending more than necessary for their purchases.<br/><br/>The second thrust concerns the relationship between the timing of total consumptions expenditures and the composition of that spending. Goods differ in terms of when they deliver utility. Some goods, such as restaurant meals and entertainment, deliver mostly short-term pleasure. Other goods, such as TVs, bicycles, and other durables, deliver both short-term and long-term pleasure. And many goods have consequences beyond the direct pleasure from consumption. For instance, potato chips, soda, or other unhealthy goods can create negative future consequences, while exercise, investment in cultural skills, and social networking can create positive future consequences. <br/><br/>The investigators show how the exact timing of when goods deliver pleasure and pain is far more important for people with self-control problems than those without, and how the availability and preferences regarding these different types of goods can dramatically change both the behavioral and welfare implications of self-control problems for the timing of consumption. The investigators intend to study how the common worry by economists about distortions in a person's overall spending and savings ought be supplemented or modified in light of concerns about what bundles of goods are being purchased.<br/><br/>In fact, among the broader impacts of this research is that it can help move economics to more realistic analysis of policies designed to address savings behavior, credit-card borrowing, overconsumption of unhealthy goods, obesity, and similar phenomena. While the research itself is preliminary and theoretical, the investigators hope that by combining the many insights of rational choice economics with the acknowledgment that people might have limits to their self-control, this research will improve the contribution economics can make to policy analysis in these areas.<br/>1"

The project falls with the comparative-historical research tradition. Comparative-historical analysis is particularly well studied for addressing broad questions of national development in which macro processes and temporal sequences are central to the explanation. <br/><br/> Historical data from 15 Latin American countries will be used to investigate the intriguing negative correlation between Spanish colonial penetration in the eighteenth century and levels of economic, social, and political development in the twentieth century. Those regions of the Spanish colonial empire that were the most heavily penetrated during the colonial period, such as Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, and Guatemala are hypothesized to have emerged as the least developed countries of Latin American in the 20th century. In contrast, those regions that were the least penetrated by the Spanish, such as Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and Costa Rica, are hypothesized t have become the most developed countries of Latin American during the 20th century. This relationship will be testing by using existing quantitative data sources to measure level of colonial penetration and level of development for the different countries of Latin America. Measures of colonial penetration include statistics on trade, population, bullion production, budgets and salary. Measures of development include statistics on gross domestic product per capita, infant mortality rate, life expectancy at birth, and democracy. Extensive readings on the historiography of late colonial Latin America will also be completed. <br/><br/>The education component of the proposal consists of providing research opportunities for students as research assistants; creating a mentor program which links undergraduate with graduate students; and developing a new seminar course on ""Colonial Legacies"" and integrating sections of the project into a current course on methodology and development."

We have assembled an inter-disciplinary research team consisting of a software engineer, a social scientist, and a database researcher. Software systems have an enormous impact on the economy and on society; an improved understanding of the social processes underlying software development could well lead to faster development of cheaper, better software systems. Our interdisciplinary collaboration builds on existing work by explicitly connecting software engineering imperatives to the techniques of social science; thus we hope to evaluate the relevance of folklore principles such as ""Conway's Law,"" that claims a relationship between artifact structure and community structure. Finally this collaboration will help us formulate new, much-needed interdisciplinary pedagogy to train both undergraduate and graduate software engineers in the social aspects of software development: team-building, work allocation, coordination, project management, and process improvement."

The experimental configuration will consist of a modular array of 2 m counter-rotating propeller fans that generate Saffir-Simpson Category 2-4 hurricane-force winds. To simulate turbulence and wind-driven rain typical of the hurricane boundary layer, an active control system will throttle the engines, articulate interlocking neutral-shape airfoils at the exit, and inject water into the flow field. The target wind field characteristics will be established from analysis of surface wind field data collected by the Florida Coastal Monitoring Program during recent tropical cyclone landfalls.<br/><br/>Through collaboration with industry and government, a series of experiments will be conducted to investigate (1) vortex suppression technologies for low-slope roofs, soffit failures and design remedies, and measures to reduce water penetration in building walls and sub-systems and (2) the accuracy of existing components and cladding testing procedures that simulate wind loading and wind-driven rain effects. An additional aim is the development of relationships between the complex test methods employed by the Wall of Wind and simpler, less expensive test methods that can be routinely used for product certification."

RUTLAND<br/>INSTITUTION: UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON<br/><br/>Large eddy simulation (LES) in rotating flows has important applications in atmospheric modeling and rotating machinery. Traditional LES approaches are based on simple modeling concepts and often fail to capture important features of turbulence in rotating systems. System rotation adds dispersive-wave interactions that significantly alter the dynamics of the energy cascade, and can change the direction of energy transfer. The Dynamic Structure Model methodology to be employed offers several significant advantages over existing LES approaches including the fact that no turbulent viscosity is used so that energy transfer can occur in either direction according to the requirements of local conditions and an energy budget is enforced between the resolved scales and the subgrid scales. This grant supports an in-depth study of LES for homogeneous, rotating flows, both decaying and forced. The performance of the Dynamic Structure Model will be compared to that of alternate models based on the ideas of an eddy-viscosity, self-similarity and a forward energy cascade.<br/>This research program has potential broad impact on LES modeling for many applications with rotation, including swirling engine flows, geophysical and astrophysical flows, climate modeling, and rotating magneto-hydrodynamic flows (e.g., dynamos). Quantitatively accurate LES can be used to explore parameter ranges that are inaccessible to DNS, i.e. larger Reynolds numbers and smaller Rossby numbers. This work could therefore also lead to expanded and deeper understanding of the mechanisms for nonlinear two-dimensionalization and the formation of cyclones in rapidly rotating flows. One graduate student will be advised jointly by the PI's. The student will participate in the Delta Program in Teaching and Learning, run by the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) supported by NSF to develop teaching skills. A focused and coordinated program within the Engine Research Center (ERC) at UW-Madison exists to develop LES models for complex engineering flows, primarily internal combustion engines.

The physics goals of the ILC are ambitious and compelling. In recent years, a world consensus has developed that the ILC should be the next major facility for high-energy physics. Here in the U.S., the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP) identified the linear collider as the highest priority for the U.S. program in elementary particle physics. At the national level, the U.S. Department of Energy announced inclusion of the ILC in its 20-year plan for new facilities, according it the highest priority among the mid-term projects under consideration. <br/><br/>To provide a framework around which the worldwide particle physics community can organize its efforts to design and build the ILC, in 2002, the International Committee for Future Accelerators formed the International Linear Collider Steering Committee (ILCSC). Last year, the ILCSC created the International Technology Recommendation Panel, which successfully made the choice of the technology for the main linear accelerator of the ILC. Earlier this year, the ILCSC created an organization to lead the next steps in the design effort for the machine: this organization is called the Global Design Effort (GDE).  The GDE will establish a Central Team and three Regional Teams, one each from Asia, Europe, and North America and each one guided by a Regional Director. The Central Team is the focal point for ILC project planning. <br/><br/>Since this proposal supports a key element in the realization of the ILC, its broader impact is that of the ILC itself. The ILC is one of the most exciting new projects in the physical sciences. The accelerator physics R&D required for the ILC will push the state of the art in many areas that have applications across the whole spectrum of accelerators. Benefits will accrue to fields, such as materials science, condensed matter physics, biophysics, and medical science, which utilize accelerators as their front-line research tools. In addition, training opportunities will be provided that can begin to address the current national shortage of accelerator physicists.<br/>"

DNA in higher organisms, including humans, is packaged into nucleosomes by wrapping around an octamer of histone proteins. This creates a potential impediment to protein-DNA interactions needed for transcription of DNA into RNA, and so at many genes these nucleosomes must be remodeled to allow transcription to occur. Enzymes and pathways that allow chromatin remodeling have been identified for some genes, but for many others these pathways remain unknown. To gain new insight into regulation of transcription by chromatin, this work will focus on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CHA1 gene. The CHA1 promoter is readily inducible by addition of serine to growth medium, and its chromatin is remodeled upon activation. Genetic and biochemical approaches will be used to ascertain the mechanism by which CHA1 chromatin structure is remodeled during activation. Repression of CHA1 in the absence of inducing signal will also be investigated. It was shown that loss of the histone H3 amino terminus causes strong CHA1 transcription under uninduced conditions, accompanied by chromatin remodeling. Novel histone H3 mutations that cause CHA1 derepression have been isolated, and will be used in a suppressor screen to uncover genes contributing to histone-mediated CHA1 repression. <br/> The significance of this work lies in its investigation of basic mechanisms of chromatin-mediated gene regulation. Chromatin has been implicated in gene regulation in development and in hormone regulation, and so is of fundamental importance. Since remodeling of the CHA1 gene does not use known mechanisms of chromatin remodeling, these studies are expected to yield fundamental new insight into this aspect of gene regulation. Furthermore, since the proteins involved in gene regulation and in chromatin are highly conserved between yeast and higher eukaryotes, including humans, these studies will reveal aspects of regulation that are likely to be common across the eukaryotic kingdom."

The long-term changes occurring at these colonies are representative of changes throughout the Ross Sea, where 30% of all Adelie penguins reside, and are in some way related to changing climate. The recent grounding of two very large icebergs against Ross and Beaufort islands, with associated increased variability in sea-ice extent, has provided an unparalleled natural experiment affecting wild, interannual swings in colony productivity, foraging effort, philopatry and recruitment. Results of this natural experiment can provide insights into the demography and geographic population structuring of this species, having relevance Antarctic-wide in understanding its future responses to climate change as well as interpreting its amazingly well known Holocene history. This ongoing study will continue to consider the relative importance of resources that constrain or enhance colony growth (nesting habitat, access to food); the aspects of natural history that are affected by exploitative or interference competition among neighboring colonies (breeding success, foraging effort); climatic factors that influence the latter, especially sea ice patterns; and behavioral mechanisms that influence colony growth as a function of initial size and location (emigration, immigration). An increased effort will focus on understanding factors that affect over-winter survival. The hypothesis is that the age structure of Cape Crozier has changed over the past thirty years and no longer reflects the smaller colonies nearby. Based on recent analyses, it appears that the Ross Island penguins winter in a narrow band of sea ice north of the Antarctic Circle (where daylight persists) and south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (where food abounds). More extensive winter ice takes the penguins north of that boundary where they incur higher mortality. Thus, where a penguin winters may be due to the timing of its post-breeding departure (which differs among colonies), which affects where it first encounters sea ice on which to molt and where it will be transported by the growing ice field. Foraging effort and interference competition for food suggested as factors driving the geographic structuring of colonies. The research includes a census of known-age penguins, studies of foraging effort and overlap among colonies; and identification of the location of molting and wintering areas. Information will be related to sea-ice conditions as quantified by satellite images. Demographic and foraging-effort models will be used to synthesize results. The iceberg natural experiment is an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the demographics of a polar seabird and its response to climate change. The marked, interannual variability in apparent philopatry, with concrete data being collected on its causes, is a condition rarely encountered among studies of vertebrates. Broader impacts include collaborating with New Zealand and Italian researchers, involving high school teachers and students in the fieldwork and continuing a website to highlight results to both scientists and the general public."

Remarkably, the bacteria found attached to particles are genetically distinct from those in the surrounding water. Bacteria that colonize particles employ species-specific enzymes that breakdown the organic content at different rates. Since sinking particles in the ocean represent a major mechanism influencing global carbon flux, bacterial metabolic activity on marine particles is an important factor in biogeochemical cycling. However, little is known regarding the variables that regulate microbial diversity on and around marine particles. This study will investigate mechanisms controlling micro-scale diversity and interactions among marine microorganisms colonizing particles. A specific focus will be microbial competition, and the possibility that pelagic bacterial population structures are influenced by the production of antibiotics. Experiments will be conducted to quantify the effects of bacterial antagonistic interactions at the molecular, single-bacteria cell, consortia, and community levels. The colonization of model particles by microbial natural assemblages will be measured in response to fluorescence-tagged antagonistic strains. Growth and respiration of sensitive strains in close proximity to antagonistic bacteria will be measured to quantify interactions at the single-cell level. Molecules produced by antagonistic bacteria will be identified and tested for their effects on particle colonization by single strains and natural consortia of bacteria. <br/><br/>This is the first, in depth investigation to probe cell-cell antagonistic interactions as a micro-scale factor involved in structuring marine microbial communities. Knowledge of microbial diversity on suspended particles will be advanced, and the interactions and specific adaptations involved in surface colonization will be better understood. This endeavor will further fuse connections between marine bacterial chemical ecology, microbial diversity, and biogeochemical cycling. Undergraduate and graduate students will be cross-trained in chemical ecology and molecular microbial ecology, and future teachers will learn molecular and microbiological techniques and concepts during one-year internships."

Architectural commitments decisively influence economic and technical success, yet we lack a validated account of key relationships between architectures and such outcomes. Baldwin and Clark have proposed an account of the nature of architecture in terms of design rules, and of its economic value in terms of real options. Sullivan has developed options-based accounts of the value of flexibility in design and tested the ability of Baldwin and Clark's models to explain information hiding and aspect-oriented design. A major open question remains: Can this approach not only describe but support development of complex, software-intensive systems? This research will perform one experiment to test the hypothesis that it can. If successful, the work will demonstrate support for the modeling of complex architectures in terms of design decisions, design rules,<br/>dependence relations on design decisions, and modularity in the dependence structure; and account for key sources of value in the system design, judged by the ways it evolved and was exploited to create value for users. A theoretical issue to be addressed is the possibility of defensible estimates of the sigma parameter of the real options valuation model."

Recent research shows that Hg(II) binds to DOM more strongly (KDOM 1023 L kg-1) than previously thought under environmentally relevant conditions. Strong binding of mercury by DOM, which is controlled by a small fraction of the DOM containing reactive thiol functional groups, is second only to sulfide when compared to other ligands of geochemical significance. In addition to strong binding of Hg(II) by thiol-like moieties associated with DOM, strong DOM-Hg interactions are apparent from studies of the effects of DOM on the dissolution and precipitation of relatively-insoluble cinnabar (HgS). Organic matter enhances HgS dissolution through surface reactions favored by DOM rich in aromatic moieties. Precipitation of metacinnabar (HgS) is inhibited by low concentrations (=3 mg C L-1) of DOM by prevention of the aggregation of nanocolloidal mercuric sulfide. Interactions of HgS with DOM can influence the geochemistry and bioavailability of Hg in aquatic environments by maintaining higher dissolved total Hg concentrations than predicted by current speciation models.<br/>In this proposal, Joe Ryan (University of Colorado at Boulder), Kathryn Nagy (University of Illinois at Chicago), and George Aiken (U.S. Geological Survey, Boulder, Colorado) outline a plan to investigate more challenging aspects of Hg-organic matter interactions. Similar interactions with selected metals (from soft to hard) will be studied. Better definition of these interactions is required for the improvement of metal speciation models and increased understanding of the factors controlling metal cycling in aquatic systems. Specific objectives of this research are to (1) quantify the effects of organic matter, metal nature, and sulfide concentration on metal binding by dissolved and solid organic matter at environmentally relevant concentrations, (2) elucidate the contributions to metal binding by sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen functional groups in organic matter, (3) examine the effect of organic matter nature on the inhibition of metal sulfide precipitation, with an emphasis on mercuric sulfide, and (4) probe the mechanism of DOM enhancement of metal-sulfide dissolution. Major products of this research will be the determination of organic matter binding constants for selected toxic metals at environmentally relevant concentrations and the assessment of colloidal stabilization as a process contributing to the occurrence of dissolved metals in aquatic systems.<br/>Broader impacts of the proposed research include dissemination of the research results at national conferences and in peer-reviewed journals in addition to the following special activities. The co-PIs and their research assistants will collaborate with Dr. Edward Tipping, developer of a widely used geochemical equilibrium model (WHAM), to incorporate new DOM-metal binding constants into metal speciation calculations and with Dr. Alain Manceau to characterize competitive binding of metals with organic matter used in bioremediation schemes. The co-PIs will develop a graduate class on the interactions of organic matter with contaminants. The information resulting from this study will be directly applicable to the effective management of aquatic ecosystems, and has important implications for ecosystem restoration programs. Dr. Aiken will continue to participate in U.S. Geological Survey efforts to make science accessible for environmental regulators managing the Florida Everglades and the San Joaquin-Sacramento River delta in California."

The still-confusing role of the solvent will be explored using a new model based on the ""microviscosity"" of the solvent. Another part of the research will focus on what effect the wavelength of light has on the cage effect in photogenerated radical cage pairs. Preliminary results show a trend opposite to that predicted by theory. Other experiments will probe spin effects on the recombination of two metal radicals, which has not been systematically addressed until now. Another set of experiments will examine the effects of radical mass, size, and shape on the cage effect. In particular, it is proposed that the ratio of the rate constants for cage escape to cage recombination is proportional to the square root of the mass divided by the surface area of the radical. This hypothesis will be tested with radicals of various masses and sizes. If this relationship is general, it will give researchers a powerful tool for predicting cage recombination efficiencies. Femtosecond timescale laser pump-probe experiments will be used to directly observe the shortlived radical cage pair. In these experiments, the cage effect for two randomly colliding radicals will be studied relative to the cage effect for a radical cage pair formed by bond homolysis. As former radicals initially have a random orientation when they meet in a cage, whereas the latter radicals are initially aligned, this difference may show up as a difference in the cage effect and in the reactivity of the cage pair. <br/><br/>Graduate students will participate in successful internship programs, which prepare Ph.D. students for successful careers in industry or teaching by placing them in regional companies or in colleges for a one-term internship experience. The research described herein has also fostered closer ties to regional companies and colleges in the form of collaborative research projects. This has led to professors at regional colleges taking sabbatical leaves in the Professor Tyler's laboratory and to students at such colleges and companies using the instrumentation in the University of Oregon Department of Chemistry."

The majority of these courses deliver the basic facts and terms of biology to large numbers of passive students. Few of these courses have learning scientific reasoning skills among their stated objectives. This project is developing a set of teaching tools and tests in biology centered around the primary learning objective of model-based reasoning (MBR), the central intellectual activity of professional biologists. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the development, evaluation, and dissemination of a set of methods and tools for teaching and testing model-based reasoning in college level introductory biology courses. An independent panel of experts, drawn from among professional biologists nationwide, is rating model-based reasoning questions. These expert ratings are compared with student performance in a classroom in which MBR problems are used for teaching and assessment. This study uses open-ended essays to investigate changes in students' descriptions of their reasoning process at several points during the course. Improvements in reasoning skills are being compared between students in MBR-based courses and traditional lecture-based instruction. A series of valid multiple-choice summative examinations designed specifically to assess model-based reasoning skills are also being developed. Model-based reasoning instruction has the potential for broad impact in introductory biology courses nationwide. It exploits the strengths of two technologies that are being widely adopted. The first is web based course support, and the second is the use of Classroom Communications Systems (personal response devices) in the lecture hall. In partnership with a major publisher, a teacher's guide and student study materials are being published."

Platelets are micron-size cells - smaller than red blood cells - and when activated they become adhesive for other activated platelets and they adhere to the vessel wall. Their strong interaction with nano-size proteins at the sub-endothelium matrix activates and reshapes them from passively traveling discoids to active spiny spheres. The length and time scales characterizing such interactions as well as platelet-blood flow interactions span several orders of magnitude.<br/><br/>We propose a multiscale modeling methodology with focus on flow-modulated phenomena such as platelet adhesion and aggregation at the micron-scale, and including nanoscale effects representing the main protein interactions. We will develop an integrated approach by coupling multiscale representations of blood flow, ranging from a quasi 1D transient flow in compliant vessels at the largest scale, to unsteady 3D flows in curved and flexing vessels at the mm range, to multi micron-scale thrombus formation at a fissure in the lumen of such a vessel with an atherosclerotic plaque, to changes over short times (seconds and minutes) in the behavior of platelet structure, receptors and bonds in a developing thrombus-wall interaction. To this end, we will develop a new mesoscopic numerical method that bridges the gap between atomistic phenomena and large-scale phenomena to seamlessly connect length scales from 10 nm to a few mm. The new simulation approach will be validated systematically against experiments of varying biological and computational complexity.<br/><br/>We also propose to establish a virtual center for multiscale modeling in order to provide modelers and experimentalists with quantitative information about molecular and cellullar processes that can be incorporated into simplified models. To this end, we plan to organize a workshop on multiscale modeling of biological processes during the second year of the proposed project. In our outreach program, we plan to engage pre-college women from the Providence area in computer and computational sciences. This will involve lectures by our medical collaborators as well as interactive learning at Brown's virtual immersive visualization facility.<br/><br/>The potential impact of this work is great as it provides a new simulation capability for studying biomolecular interactions in blood vessels, organs and the entire arterial tree in a few hours instead of days or even weeks on a supercomputer. This, in turn, will allow fundamental studies at the molecular and cellular level and interaction with macroscales not currently possible with existing methodologies."

Specifically, it creates the first digital cd rom-based hypertext ethnography. The project's potential broader impact is twofold. It could potentially provide techniques for better archiving ethnographic research, thereby allowing for a wider dissemination of research findings and methods. Second, because it will be of interest to a wide variety of scholars (both for its teaching, substantive and methodological contribution) it serves as a model for creative strategies for data collection, archiving and distribution. This project, by creating replicatable ethnographic data, also strengthens the scientific basis of qualitative research."

Much of the empirical work on mental rotation in the field of cognitive psychology has focused on mental rotation of objects. However, within the last few decades, researchers have begun to examine other classes of mental rotation, including mental rotation of body parts and one's own body. Researchers also have begun using neuroimaging techniques to explore whether these different classes of mental transformations are supported by unique neural mechanisms. One contentious finding within the cognitive neuroscience literature is that some classes of mental rotation have been shown to activate low-level motor areas of the brain, while others have not. For example, researchers have found activation in primary motor and premotor regions in some imagined object rotation tasks, presumably because such tasks allow people to anticipate what they would see if they had manipulated a physical object. In contrast, despite its obvious link to body movement, the task of mental rotation of one's own body has been shown to elicit no low-level motor activation. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Maryjane Wraga's research focuses on these questions by examining the motor processing within a wider range of mental rotation tasks than previously has been studied. The research is being conducted using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which will allow for direct comparisons of specific brain regions of interest across experimental conditions. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are a greater understanding of the neural processes underlying the widely used skill of mental rotation. The project will provide opportunities for undergraduate women at Smith College to become involved in the field of cognitive neuroscience. Students will gain hands-on experience in every aspect of fMRI experimentation, from designing and programming studies, to running participants in the fMRI scanner, to analyzing and interpreting results. Such opportunities will facilitate participation of an underrepresented group within the field of cognitive neuroscience."

The governance of agrarian reform through the cadastral infrastructure finds itself in tension between government policies and practices of civil society that arose in the 18th century partitions of Poland and was exacerbated by wars, occupations, population displacements, and the Communist planned economy. The ongoing process of EU-promoted liberal agrarian reform and cadastral infrastructure modernization involves the establishment of territorial hegemonic consent through administrative technologies that encounters this tension. With unclear property ownership ranging from 3 percent to 40 percent in rural areas of Poland, the ambiguity about formal land tenure signals the continuing degree of civil and political society tension. The Polish government has sought to modernize the cadastral infrastructure, but since the mid-1990s, proposals to modernize the cadastre have been stymied in Polish parliament. Through an agricultural parcel registry to control subsidy applications, the EU offers the administration a technological solution that may circumvent the political impasse. Discrepancies between this registry and the existing land cadastre are provided to county (powiat) administrations in Poland, but the updating of the cadastral land registry is solely a local decision. The objective of this research is to establish how people, technologies, and institutions create and maintain governance and consent in the face of civil and political society tensions. Comparing Polish local government activities during the process of agrarian reform sheds light on the variability of governance and different roles of administrative technologies.<br/><br/>Historical studies of cadastral mapping show that the cadastre is a key part of territorial governance. This research will examine contemporary cadastral infrastructure focusing on how territorial governance develops. The working hypothesis is that the governmentality of the cadastral infrastructure hinges on the development of sufficient local ""flexibility"" between informal land tenure regimes and formal land cadastre and the corresponding establishment of ""flexible,"" scale-contingent hegemonic consent between civil and political society. The updating of land cadastres by Polish county administrations constitutes a key government intervention in agrarian reform. This research extends Verdery's parcel elasticity concept to consider the multiple roles of the cadastral infrastructure. The science and technology studies concept of boundary objects takes into account the interactions and flexibility between people, institutions, and technologies; these objects in the cadastral infrastructure are essential to creating and maintaining hegemonic consent. The research will rely on interpretative ethnographic methods developed for comparative research over a three-year period. Graduate students at Polish higher education institutes will conduct more than 1,000 interviews with government officials and farmers in six counties. U.S. students will also take part in the interviews, and the investigators will conduct two years of participant observation research in a specific locality.<br/><br/>This research will contributes to geography, geographic information science, area studies, science and technology studies, and graduate student education in the U.S. and Poland. The results of the research will inform policy concerning the resolution of ambiguities and discrepancies in cadastral records that constrain agricultural modernization and sustainable rural development. The project will actively involve Polish and U.S. graduate and undergraduate students and scientists, including minority students involved in indigenous studies."

But even with steady advances in model resolution and physics, precipitation forecasts have been slow to improve. It has become evident that there are substantial deficiencies in model bulk microphysical parameterizations (BMP) of cloud and precipitation processes, that is, the model descriptions of moist processes. Underlying these deficiencies are considerable uncertainties in many of the assumptions on which BMPs are based. One avenue to improve the performance of a BMP is to compare microphysical processes and predicted cloud/precipitation distributions from model simulations with in situ (mainly airborne) and remotely sensed (e.g., radar) observations. In addition, it is critically important that the microphysical measurements be obtained concurrently with observations of wind, temperature and humidity, so that errors in the simulated microphysics can be isolated from errors in other predicted fields. <br/><br/>In response to these problems, UW researchers initiated a study entitled Improvement of Microphysical PaRameterization Through Observational Verification Experiment (IMPROVE) to acquire the observations required to compare cloud and precipitation processes in current forecast and research models with detailed measurements and observations from a variety of weather systems. Two field studies were conducted: the Washington Offshore Frontal Study (IMPROVE-1), which examined frontal systems as they approached the Washington coast from 4 January to 14 February 2001; and, the Oregon Cascades Orographic Study (IMPROVE-2), which examined the orographic modulation of clouds and precipitation across the Oregon Cascades between 26 November and 22 December 2001. Making use of a comprehensive array of observing platforms, both field studies were highly successful in obtaining data for evaluating the performance of BMPs in mesoscale models, with twenty-six Intensive Observing Periods (IOPs) encompassing a wide variety of frontal and orographic precipitation systems. Analysis of this data has documented significant problems with the most sophisticated microphysics scheme in the MM5 model, including excessive snow amounts over the windward slopes and mountain crest, excessive snow blow-over to the lee slopes, too much cloud liquid water over the lower windward slopes and too little over the crest, problematic snow size distributions, and unrealistic graupel amounts at mid-levels. <br/><br/>This research will determine if these and other microphysical problems are revealed in other cases. Specifically, observational data from additional IMPROVE IOPs will be analyzed to ascertain the physical processes leading to the development of clouds/precipitation in the observed cases, followed by a comparison with mesoscale model simulations down to resolutions of approximately 1 km. These comparisons will provide the basis for modifications to BMPs in order to better represent the development of clouds and precipitation. In addition, the dual-Doppler radar data from NOAA P3 aircraft flights during IMPROVE will be used to evaluate the fidelity of mountain waves and other key mesoscale structures in the model. Finally, based on the above evaluations, modifications in the model moist physics will be evaluated for a wide variety of storm systems studied during IMPROVE, as well as in daily operational forecast runs of the University of Washington's real-time MM5/WRF regional forecast system. <br/><br/>Regarding intellectual merit, the Principal Investigators will analyze probably the most comprehensive data set in existence dealing with the flow and moist physics over a topographic barrier. This study will provide the best evaluation to date of the fidelity of mesoscale model structures and moist physics over terrain and should lead to improved moist process parameterizations in weather prediction models. <br/><br/>The research has the potential for broad benefits to society. The identification and correction of deficiencies in the moist physics of weather forecast models should result in improved understanding and prediction of clouds and precipitation, with the attendant societal and economic benefits. The physical understanding and model improvements resulting from this project will be widely disseminated for use by operational forecasting centers and other groups. This effort will also have substantial educational benefits, creating a group of graduate students knowledgeable in this critical area, and will expose a number of undergraduates to this important research topic."

Soybean and corn will be used as model systems for C3 and C4 plants. Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy will be combined with the micrometeorological methods to provide simultaneous, near-continuous measurement of isotopomer mixing ratios and isotopic fluxes of CO2 and water vapor, and 18O discrimination factors at the ecosystem scale. <br/><br/>The ability to determine the ecosystem-scale 18O discrimination is essential to a number of fundamental science questions relevant to atmospheric carbon budget and ecosystem processes. The broader impacts of the proposed activity include the acquisition of unique datasets for validation of atmospheric carbon budget models. The innovative research methods will enhance the capacity of the global carbon and energy flux observational network and foster collaboration between university scientists and engineers in a private industry. The new knowledge gained during the project will be transferred to the greater scientific community through a special conference session and training of undergraduate and graduate students. Finally, the overall strategy on the coupled exchanges of CO2 and water through the 18O isotopes should open a new dimension for investigating the carbon and water cycles in a truly integrated manner."

Because cnidarians diverged from the rest of the animals prior to the evolution of organs, their overall anatomy is quite simple. Despite this however, cnidarians have attained incredible diversity, comprising over 11,000 species, many of which display elaborate structures and complex life histories. The lack of organs and other anatomical landmarks has made it difficult for scientists to discern their evolutionary relationships. Recent technological and theoretical advances in the sequencing and analysis of DNA provide the opportunity to use the information encoded within an organism's genetic code to elucidate evolutionary relationships. The primary aim of this proposal is to obtain DNA sequence data from 1,800 cnidarian species: this will generate approximately 23 million base pairs of cnidarian DNA sequence, and the specimens from which the sequences are obtained will be retained in natural history museum collections. The information encoded in the DNA will be used to reconstruct cnidarian phylogenies (evolutionary trees), using computer algorithms and supercomputing facilities. Some of the questions this proposal will address are: Was the ancestor to all of cnidarians solitary or colonial? Are jellyfish or hydras more closely related to the corals? How and when did coral skeletons evolve? What are the evolutionary transitions between a simple hydra polyp and a complex Portuguese Man-of-War colony? Reconstructing a cnidarian evolutionary tree is important for our understanding of the patterns and processes that accompanied the early diversification of animal life. <br/><br/><br/><br/> Formal and informal education will result from this research. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars, including those belonging to groups under-represented in the sciences, will be trained. A symposium on cnidarian evolutionary relationships will be organized by the investigators at a national scientific meeting. A Cnidaria Tree of Life database will be developed to include outreach and learning components such as images, common names, and keys designed to appeal to students at all levels as well as interested users such as divers and aquarists. Museum exhibits will be created based on research results, one at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum, and one, entitled ""Cnidarian Diversity in the Oceans"" that will be part of the new Oceans Hall, due to open at the National Museum of Natural History in 2008. A website and classroom poster (in both English and Spanish) integrated with the latter exhibit will be created in collaboration with a K-12 educator supported through NSF's Research Experience for Teachers program."

These schemes will then be applied to quantify confidence in estimates of the climate-critical ocean circulation at Denmark Strait and the Irminger Sea. The project will pursue three overlapping objectives: to quantify posterior covariance in (i) four-dimensional variational assimilation, (ii) particle filters, and, (iii) particle smoothers. For (i) a novel scheme of constrained variation will be employed to calculate selected elements of the inverse Hessian (or Fisher) matrix of the maximum-likelihood cost function. For (ii) and (iii) a combination of parametric and moment-closure methods will be developed to overcome rank-deficiency problems in the particle/ensemble covariance estimates. In each case, the new methods will be initially developed for simple low-order dynamical systems, then applied to an eddy-resolving model of the ocean circulation in the Denmark Strait and Irminger Sea. The project will focus on the importance of non-Gaussian error statistics which are clearly present in this oceanographic application.<br/><br/>It is now widely accepted that data assimilation will play a major role in the future of ocean sciences with repercussions for diverse users in the fishing industry, marine transportation, naval operations, and recreation. Data assimilation provides a merger of oceanic measurements (from in-situ instruments and satellites) and knowledge of ocean physics in a numerical algorithm. In principle, it permits critical estimates of ocean temperatures, salinities, and currents in the past, present, and future, depending on the data coverage and the computer power available. However, because of natural variability in the chaotic ocean dynamics, some quantities are intrinsically unpredictable and a range of outcomes with widely different consequences are equally compatible with the available measurements. To be useful for practical decision-making, state and parameter estimates must be accompanied by a realistic assessment of their uncertainty. This project will apply some recent theoretical breakthroughs in applied mathematics to develop accurate assessments of uncertainty in calculated ocean estimates from data assimilation. The project will focus on an important application of great practical and theoretical interest, the ocean circulation southeast of Greenland. Knowledge of the ocean conditions in this area is particularly important for monitoring and predicting climate change. The project will also educate and train undergraduate, postgraduate, and post-doctoral students in the mathematical foundations of data assimilation and its practical application to the oceans."

For example: is the evolution of HIV virulence related <br/>to rates of transmission among hosts? Which environmental factors most <br/>strongly influence the rate of evolution, and what are the strengths <br/>and directions of evolution? This broad class of questions all involve <br/>adaptive evolution (i.e., the direction and strength of natural <br/>selection).

Methods are <br/>provided for formulating scientific hypotheses as explicit mathematical <br/>models, each of which can then be fit to the data. Modern <br/>model-selection theory is then to identify the best-support model or <br/>models. Because in this approach, the causal factors of interest are <br/>explicitly modeled and tested directly against data, scientists will be <br/>able to use these methods to identify which aspects of the evolutionary <br/>process are most important, describe the relative strengths and <br/>directions of these evolutionary forces, and understand how they have <br/>influenced the tempo and mode of evolution.<br/><br/>The comparative method is a fundamental tool in organismal, <br/>evolutionary and ecological biology.

The Center will be a collaboratory for researchers in the US and abroad, allowing them to coordinate their work and maximize the impact of their findings in ways that presently do not exist. <br/><br/>Increasingly, learners are seeking out and engaging with other learners and with digital resources in online communities. Despite the exciting, open-ended potentials of engaged online learning, little is known today about what takes place when deep and engaged learning occurs in online communities, how group configurations and community structures matter, or how learning by online groups can be supported to develop over time. <br/><br/>This planning project brings together a core group of researchers from around the country who have begun to investigate aspects of engaged learning in online communities. Centered around four established online communities for supporting learning, it focuses on the engaged learning of mathematics and science. It also reaches out internationally to establish working relations with relevant research networks abroad. <br/><br/>Online learning has the potential to help overcome inequities of opportunity for learners. People can participate in online learning regardless of their geographic location, time constraints, gender, initial interest, self-confidence, minority status, age, disability, or skill levels. Support of engaged learning in online communities can take advantage of new media and technologies. It can incorporate formal and informal contexts, like schools, museums, games and hobbies. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This Catalyst project brings together a critical mass of researchers from a spectrum of disciplines, each of whom have already made significant contributions to this timely area of the sciences of learning. The project is identifying detailed and rigorous methods to study the relations between cognitive and affective components of online learning at three levels of analysis: the individual, small group, and community. Such knowledge can help design new global learning opportunities for a broad spectrum of learners.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The world of the 21st century will involve technologically mediated spaces, where online lifelong learning will take place. Work-spaces, museums, schools, healthcare facilities, and other social institutions increasingly combine physical and virtual interactions. The work of this Catalyst and the SLC research agenda that it will define are essential to a world that increasingly involves computer-supported cooperative work and collaborative learning. The principles developed for mathematical and scientific learning can be explored and adjusted for other disciplines and new forms of formal and informal learning within online communities."

Each participant makes local autonomous decisions towards its individual goals which may potentially conflict with those of other participants. Open decentralized systems do not regulate the entry of participants into the system, potentially exposing the system to participants with malicious goals. In the absence of a controlling authority, each decentralized participant must take upon itself the responsibility of safeguarding itself against such attacks. Trust relationships based on reputation of participants can serve as important constituents in countermeasures against such attacks. A participant accumulates trust related information, analyzes the information, and builds trust relationships with other participants. These established trust relationships can be used to determine who can be trusted during future ensuing interactions.<br/><br/>Substantial effort has been devoted to developing decentralized reputation management systems. However, the existing literature has two major shortcomings. First, it has not directly addressed how such reputation management systems can be designed and developed in the context of an application. The underlying issue is that from a software engineering perspective, we lack a fundamental understanding of how all these components should be put together in a networked decentralized environment to provide a stable and secure system capable of withstanding security attacks. Second, there has been insufficient work directed at evaluating whether existing models effectively address critical threats. In addition, there has also been no comprehensive study of how a reputation model can be designed to counter various kinds of security attacks. The fundamental problem is that from a security perspective, there is a lack of both theoretical and empirical insights on how a reputation model can help detect, protect, and resist against attacks launched by a malicious participant or a group of colluding malicious participants.<br/><br/>Building on prior work, and drawing insights from a host of domains such as security, trust management, and software architecture, the project will create a comprehensive software architecture-based approach to engineering secure decentralized applications. The investigation of new modeling constructs, reasoning techniques, design principles and supporting tools will be conducted in three phases: theoretical analysis, development and assessment of guidelines, techniques, and tools through prototyping, and finally scalability and robustness assessment through simulation. Broader impacts will include influencing how large decentralized systems are built as well as educational curriculum."

In an attempt to make current tools and theoretical work more aligned with the needs of applications, we will focus on four important topics for group decision- making: (1) Obtaining and representing preferences of group members. This is a well-recognized bottleneck for decision-making because of the difficult cognitive requirements it places on individuals. (2) Efficiently solving games. Game theory is the primary mathematical tool used to model and understand group decision-making and group formation. Solutions to games are used to explain and to recommend social behavior, but computing such solutions is a notoriously difficulty problem. (3) Group and team formation. Given a group of people with different capabilities, how does one select the best team for handling a given task? Current methods are very limited in how they model such problems, e.g., they do not model negative interactions between group members. (4) Adaptive behavior.

The project will create research topics in multiscale mathematics, statistics, and software application integration with a flexible, Grid-based<br/>database and problem solving environment. The project will follow an integrated approach that addresses technical issues at each step of the process: 1) the dynamic simulation instructs the sensors what to look for and reprograms it for those analytes, 2) the sensors report to the simulation the new observed data, and 3) the simulation then incorporates the new data, updates its predictions, and reprograms the sensors as necessary in a closed loop.

This resource, vital to human activities, is constantly threatened by contamination. Groundwater becomes contaminated when man-made and sometimes naturally-occurring substances are dissolved in waters recharging the groundwater. Often, as groundwater is connected with lakes and rivers, the pollution of these surface waters implies the pollution of aquifers. Thus, it is important to understand the flow and transport of the coupled system of rivers, lakes, and aquifers. In this first application, such complex multiphysics couplings are studied.<br/><br/>The second application modeled in this work involves sepsis, which in the U.S. is the primary cause of death in critically ill patients. Sepsis can be defined as an uncontrolled inflammatory response due to bacterial infection. As of today, there are very few therapeutic options available to patients. Simulating inflammation and organ dysfunction that accompany sepsis can help understand this complex problem. The modeling process consists of identifying key chemical components and their interaction in different subdomains such as organs, epithelial layers, and blood arteries.<br/><br/>The underlying mathematical equations characterizing both applications are similar. Those equations are derived from the balance equations of continuum mechanics that express the conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy of an arbitrary volume moving within a fluid. Efficient and reliable numerical methods will be developed as a part of this project. One project output will be a computational tool that is beneficial to both environmental engineers and medical personnel. On one hand, effective strategies for clean-up of contaminated groundwaters can be simulated. At the same time,a better understanding of the inflammatory response due to bacterial infection will lead to the design of therapeutic solutions for sepsis. Another impact of this project will be the stimulation of the discovery process for undergraduate and graduate students involved in the research project.<br/><br/>Educational activities for the proposed project include the development of a new modeling course, the creation of a Master's degree in Computational and Applied Mathematics, the continuous mentorship of graduate and undergraduate students and their exposure to international collaborations, and an increase in the number of students, including minorities, graduating with a Master or Ph.D. degree in Mathematics."

These activities will require integrated networks of instruments, sensors, robots, and vehicles to cooperate forming a ""digital ocean."" Underwater communication via propagating acoustic signals holds the best promise for reliable and general purpose wireless communications in the ocean. Significant advances have been made in recent years to establish physical layer point-to-point links in many types of ocean environments. Yet, the development of higher layer techniques suitable for the challenging characteristics of the ocean environment remains largely unexplored territory. Networking the ""digital ocean"" via underwater acoustic communications remains one of the formidable technical obstacles to the a fully networked ocean. Challenges to be overcome by underwater acoustic modem and network designers include: severely limited range-dependent bandwidth and attenuation, extensive time-varying multipath propagation, and low speed of sound propagation in water resulting in long propagation delays. For sensor network deployment, these features imply that asynchronous and adaptive networking must be considered, typical medium access control will not be feasible, deterministic algorithms may not be feasible due to the stochastic nature of underwater networks, and link quality prediction and estimation will be paramount to delivering the desired quality of service. Finally, distance-dependent bandwidth implies that everything from capacity analysis to medium access control must be redeveloped under these new constraints. Terrestrial sensor networks are typically distinguished by high node density, large amounts of potentially correlated sensed data, stringent limitations on system resources, and multiple sources of uncertainty. Underwater sensor networks have even stronger limitations. To achieve the goals of an undersea sensor network, the PIs propose to study the following: network topology optimization and estimation, channel & energy-aware routing, delay/disruption tolerant underwater networking, cross-layer designs which integrate underwater channel characteristics, impact of the underwater acoustic channel on scaling laws and fundamental limits, experimental validation of system concepts for underwater acoustic networking"

Understanding the importance of species' interactions and their impact on communities is thus a central goal of ecologists and conservation biologists, and is the central aim of this work. The overarching goal is to examine the interactions between termites and large vertebrates in supporting the biological diversity of East African savannas, and to understand how these groups affect the distribution, diversity and abundance of other species. Such an understanding is of paramount importance as these habitats are lost, fragmented, and modified through agricultural use. Termites have been identified as key species, crucial to the functioning of entire ecosystems. In East Africa, termite mounds are a common feature of the landscape. Through their mound building activities, termites enhance soil nutrients and thus may be affect the diversity of the plants and insects that live in close proximity to these mounds. Vertebrates have also been implicated as playing a large role in the ecology of savanna habitats. However, the interactions between termites and herbivores and their effects on communities have rarely been examined. This work will provide novel data on the interactions between termites and vertebrates in providing habitat and resources that structure plant and animal communities across much of East Africa. These data are critical to understanding the forces that generate and maintain habitat heterogeneity and species diversity and to managing savanna ecosystems.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will support one full-time Post-doctoral Researcher, one part-time Post-doctoral Researcher, two graduate students (one in Kenya, one in the U.S.), three full-time technicians (two in Kenya, one in the US), and two part-time field assistants each year. The project will also be used for teaching at least 20 students per year through UC Santa Barbara's Kenya Wildlands Program. Yearly meetings will be held with the Laikipia Wildlife Forum, which includes scientists, local ranch managers and traditional Maasai pastoralists, to discuss the results of the project. The results will be disseminated to scientists in Kenya at the International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology, the National Museums of Kenya and the University of Nairobi. The project represents a significant contribution to human resource development, bridge-building among scientific institutions and among the scientific and lay communities of East Africa, and education in a geographical region where such opportunities are rare."

The goal is to surround the incoming students with support and involve them early in the research efforts of the departments through faculty and peer mentoring. The activities are expected to facilitate an increase in the number of STEM majors incrementally, 10% each year, to reach new highs in STEM retention, ultimately leading to graduation rates of 58%, the institution's average for all majors. The majors most affected are biology, chemistry, and computer science, as differentiated from the mathematics, engineering, and physics disciplines that are mainly service-oriented at the institution.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>Undergraduate research is being enhanced in a variety of disciplines including information assurance, genetics, ecology, analytical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry. Undergraduates become involved in research projects at the very beginning of their university career so that faculty can play an important role in mentoring STEM students. As these students progress, they become peer mentors to assist the following STEM majors. The research experiences along with cooperative learning laboratories are promoting student understanding of how science is conducted. To retain these students, the Supplemental Instructor (SI) method is being integrated into the introductory science classrooms. SI has been successfully used nationwide and on this campus to improve student performance. By providing SI instruction in the introductory science courses, all of the STEM majors are being reached, not just the group involved in the undergraduate research component. The students recruited into the program also gain a broader perspective of science by exploring the careers of successful scientists from a variety of disciplines through discussions of biographies/autobiographies. The reading forum allows for a broader discussion of the science world, ethics, and career guidance not normally allotted time in an undergraduate curriculum.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The extrinsic merits of the STEM reform are 1) educating the public of the many merits of a science career, 2) providing an opportunity for students to become involved in independent and multidisciplinary research projects and to present their findings; and 3) instilling an understanding of the possibilities that the field of science can provide for STEM majors. A Summer Science Open House encompassing not only the traditional high school juniors but also Saint Francis University admissions counselors and high school guidance counselors is designed to impact STEM recruitment in the geographical area. Exposing and educating high school guidance counselors on the many merits of a science career enables them to pass this knowledge on to students and to better nurture their talents. The hiring of a graduate assistant for STEM recruitment is expected to have a large impact on the ability of the institution to increase the overall number of STEM graduates by 60% (from 45 to 75 STEM students). To broaden the reach across the region, a week-long one-credit summer science course for high school juniors is being implemented."

The study and model development will focus on this protozoan parasite because T. gondii is the major cause of death in southern sea otters, and otters serve as a valuable sentinel for marine pollution with this important human pathogen. Focusing on two coastal sites where T. gondii infections and mortality in sea otters are prevalent, this integrated study has three components that link terrestrial ecology to land use patterns and ultimately to sea otter ecology. Investigators from University of California at Davis, California State University at Fresno, Institute of Ecosystems Study, and University of British Columbia will predict terrestrial environmental contamination with oocysts and risk of exposure to T. gondii based on the prevalence of infection in domestic felids and wild rodent populations. The investigators hypothesize that there is a distinct spatial pattern of risk for otters because land runoff forms well-defined zones at specific locations in coastal waters, and high oocyst concentrations are expected in these zones. Finally, they propose to study whether individual otter diet and movements can predict the risk of exposure and death from protozoal encephalitis caused by T. gondii infection. Data from the three components will permit evaluating the impact of alternative control strategies using simulation modeling to test whether reduction of putative risk factors will reduce site-specific incidence and prevalence of T. gondii in otters. This project is unique in its multidisciplinary and comprehensive approach - incorporating terrestrial and marine ecologists, oceanographers, epidemiologists, and parasitologists to investigate the ecology of an important environmental pathogen at the interface of terrestrial and aquatic systems. <br/> <br/>In terms of the broader impacts of this study, this project emphasizes graduate student training in research and outreach. Overall, 4 Ph.D. and 2 Masters students will be mentored in research and outreach efforts. The simulation model will permit evaluation of different control strategies to reduce pathogen pollution of the near shore marine environment. This will benefit the threatened southern sea otter population that is struggling to recover, as well as other marine wildlife and humans in coastal areas. Sea otters are a flagship species with extremely high visibility, which provides a unique opportunity to inform the public about the land-sea interface and pathogen pollution. A public website www.seaotterresearch.org will be expanded to include specific information on the goals of this study and to publicize the findings in a public-friendly format with special interactive sections devoted to younger students (K-8), land and water resource managers, and cat owners. A brochure explaining risks of toxoplasmosis, suggested best practices for cat owners, and methods to reduce environmental exposure to T. gondii will be provided to the cat-owning public through pet product retailers and veterinarians in coastal areas. Sea otter bookmarks with the web address will also be provided at no cost through pet product retailers and schools in the high impact areas. Public town hall meetings will be organized and attended by senior personnel and students at both study sites to inform and discuss with local residents the rationale, design and findings of the study. Each of the graduate students involved in the project will be trained in public relations/speaking and will be required to make at least 2 presentations per year at schools and public meetings in high-risk communities. In addition, to original research publications, students will present the results of this research at national scientific conferences."

The seismic risk issues ports face are unique due to the nature of their infrastructure, long-range planning horizon, diversity of stakeholders, and the roles of port authorities. This Grand Challenge project integrates engineering, logistics, risk analysis, and decision sciences within a seismic risk reduction framework that uses the performance of the port system rather than its individual components as the basis for seismic risk mitigation decisions. This systems-level approach is essential for estimating the full scope of direct and indirect losses following an earthquake. The NEES program enables a novel, integrated experimental and numerical simulation approach to advance understanding of the complex soil-foundation-structure systems that are typical of ports to develop geotechnical and structural mitigation alternatives targeted at all parts of the soil-foundation-structure system. The research program examines two innovative soil improvement techniques that are well suited to port facilities and evaluates their performance using the NEES@UTexas mobile shaker and the NEES@UCDavis centrifuge. The strength and ductility of piles and their connections to the overlying deck play a vital role in the seismic performance of pile-supported wharves. Improved pile configurations and pile-deck connections will be developed using full-scale tests at NEES@UIUC. Emphasis will be<br/>placed on techniques that are ""repair-friendly"" and can quickly and inexpensively be returned to service following an earthquake. Tests will be performed at NEES@Buffalo to investigate innovative bracing systems to mitigate damage to cranes from large ground displacements due to liquefaction. These tests exploit the full potential of the NEES program by using hybrid numerical and experimental simulation. The experimental studies on these soil-foundation-structure systems will be used to develop and calibrate numerical models. An important contribution is the development of soil-pile and pile-deck dynamic macroelements that will fill the existing gap between simplified solutions and computationally intensive numerical solutions for soil-structure interaction problems. Numerical simulations will be used to develop fragility relationships for the integrated soil-foundation-structure system that lead directly to the operational capacity of the wharf following an earthquake and facilitate the subsequent determination of repair requirements for the damaged system. Fragility relationships will be developed that reflect the performance of treated soils, improved pile-deck connections, and retrofitted cranes so that the effects of<br/>these mitigation alternatives on the operational capacity and repair requirements can be discerned.<br/><br/>Understanding system-level impacts of risk mitigation strategies on the functionality of a port is a crucial component of the seismic risk reduction framework. Advanced meta-heuristics for real-time operations optimization given component disruptions will be developed to provide decision support to stakeholders. Parametric approximation models of port system performance measures that can be incorporated directly into an optimization-based risk mitigation framework to inform decision makers will also be developed. Application of formal research on stakeholder participation and behavioral decision making to risk mitigation at ports has been extremely limited to date. The nature of seismic risk in ports and port authorities and operations make them fertile ground for the social and decision sciences research proposed in this project. The project furthers value-focused decision research by integrating it with research on how stakeholders and experts perceive and understand seismic hazards and risks. In doing so, the project will provide new insights on the relative roles of mental models of risks, values, and institutional affiliations in judgment and decision making about seismic and other risks. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include the application of the real-time decision support models to minimize the impact of an act of terrorism at a U.S. port. Ports are thought to be one of the most vulnerable components of the nation's transportation system. Like natural hazards, acts of terrorism reduce the throughput capacity of the port by damaging some or all of a port's facilities. In this respect, the development of these decision support models that optimize throughput capacity during periods of disruption can contribute to increased homeland security. The education, outreach, and training program promotes education at several levels and addresses the dearth of under-represented students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. A collaborative HBCU-REU program will increase the number of under-represented students in the STEM areas that pursue advanced degrees; Minority Postdoctoral Fellowships will help bridge the link from graduate school to academia; and an Industrial Fellowship Program will aid in technology transfer to practicing engineers. These programs form a continuum from undergraduate through professional education and will make a significant impact on creating a diverse workforce in the STEM areas."

Their directional optical properties are described by Bidirectional Transmission (or Reflection) Distribution Functions, abbreviated BT(R)DF, that express the emerging light flux distribution for a given incident direction.<br/>Their accurate assessment requires an appropriate experimental equipment. To answer this need, the investigator and her colleagues develop a new measurement device, able to achieve truly time-efficient bidirectional measurements of coatings or materials. This innovative bidirectional goniophotometer, also convertible into a fully automated heliodon for qualitative studies on scale models, collects the light flux emitted by the analyzed component on a half-mirrored hemi-ellipsoid and redirects it towards a calibrated digital camera equipped with a fish-eye lens. Only one set of images taken at different integration intervals is therefore needed to achieve a complete and continuous visualization of the emerging light distribution, which is a unique feature compared to conventional, point-per-point goniophotometers. The other major innovations of this research are to offer a wavelength-dependent investigation and to do this over the full solar spectrum. Extending the applicability of bidirectional functions to the near-IR spectral range opens new perspectives in managing and controlling solar gains, and leads to refinements in the location of the building's thermal mass. <br/><br/><br/>Non-technical description<br/><br/>Daylighting, or more generally lighting, not only has to adequately respond to our needs for visual comfort and for a healthy environment, it can also greatly contribute to reduce the environmental impact of buildings, considering that they represent about a third of the total energy use and that 40% of this energy today is generally dedicated to lighting. A carefully planned lighting strategy can also significantly reduce heating and cooling needs for housing by increasing solar gains in the winter and decreasing them in the summer. At the same time, numerous scientific studies have demonstrated the strongly positive impact of daylight availability on human productivity and well-being. <br/>To answer the consequential increasing incentive to design buildings more adapted to daylighting, the investigator and her colleagues develop an original, leading-edge and time-efficient measurement device for investigating how light is distributed inside a space after being redirected or altered by advanced daylight collection and redirecting systems or luminaires components. The instrument relies on digital imaging techniques to reduce the measurement time to a minimum, while offering a wavelength-dependent analysis over the whole solar spectrum to extend the materials' investigation to the thermal aspects of solar radiation. <br/>Having access to such a detailed information is critical for manufacturers that want to quickly develop and optimize their products, for architects to get guidelines in the judicious selection of the proper window and lighting components already at the project's design level, and for daylighting simulation tool developers to extend the capabilities of such software by including advanced light redirecting systems in connection with thermal control. Despite the complexity of its outcomes, the assessment process remains here rapid and cheap to efficiently promote more healthy and sustainable design"

The equipment will support research in two areas of broad technical and societal impact:<br/>(1) Increased efficiency and lower emissions for industrial furnaces; the requested equipment will support research that will provide insight, in real-world-scale working furnaces and boilers, on how to design furnaces and burners that address the ""Clear Skies Initiative"" and ""Global Climate Change Initiatives.""  <br/>(2) Under certain conditions, carbon nanotubes can be produced in the boiler combustion chamber, leading to the possibility of large-scale nanotube production with state-of-the-art quality. A study of the flame structure during nanoparticle formation and processing is a key to understanding and controlling the nanotube production process. The equipment will support research on the fundamental mechanisms of nanotube development in working furnaces and provide a basis for the development of production methods for nano-scale components on an industrial scale.<br/>"

The first is to develop efficient numerical methods for material transport on moving interfaces with global dynamics. The main difficulty is the coupling of the global dynamics, the moving interface and the material distribution on the interface. The investigator will develop efficient and robust methods that can<br/>(1) track material transport on moving interfaces,<br/>(2) couple interfacial dynamics with global dynamics.<br/>In particular the developed numerical methods will be used to study the effect of surfactants in two phase flow. The second is to analyze and extend the fast sweeping method, which is an efficient iterative method recently developed for Eikonal equations on rectangular grids, to unstructured grids and general Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Convergence and error analysis will be carried out. The fact that the fast sweeping method for a nonlinear problem converges in a finite number of iterations is a remarkable result. Further exploration of this method in the general framework of iterative methods will not only provide efficient numerical methods for may important applications but will also shed insight for constructing iterative methods for other nonlinear problems. The above research projects will involve interdisciplinary<br/>collaborations and will be integrated with education<br/>at different levels.<br/><br/>Numerical computations play a crucial role in modern science and technology while development of efficient and robust numerical algorithms is the underlying basic task.

Additional methodological approaches are necessary to characterize the role of such visual cortical activity during non-visual perception and the underlying neural mechanisms. With National Science Foundation funding, this research embodies a collaboration among Drs. Krishnankutty Sathian, John Foxe, and Charles Schroeder that brings different techniques to bear on the issue of multisensory form processing in extrastriate visual cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans is being combined with event-related potential (ERP) studies in humans and neurophysiologic studies in macaque monkeys, using experimental designs common to the three methods. The high spatial resolution of fMRI and the high temporal resolution of ERP studies are mutually complementary and allow specification of the temporal profile of neural activity, as well as precise localization. Monkey studies entail a combination of field potential and action potential analyses that allow both direct comparison to human (ERP/fMRI) data and investigation of the cellular bases of ERP and fMRI effects. Specific Aim I investigates the recruitment of visual cortical activity by tactile form discriminations and Specific Aim II explores multisensory interactions between vision and touch, during tactile form perception. The combination of three complementary experimental approaches being brought to bear on a common set of questions, using a common set of tasks, is unique and promises to provide a much more complete picture of the relevant neural processes than any of the approaches in isolation. This tripartite approach allows the acquisition of convergent evidence on the specific brain mechanisms of multisensory interactions, which are increasingly recognized to be ubiquitous and essential for sensory processing as well as other aspects of cognition. <br/><br/>Among its broader impacts, this project exemplifies the value of bringing multiple experimental approaches to bear on a set of issues. The project is anticipated to lead eventually to improvement in assistive technology available to individuals with sensory deprivation of any kind. By establishing a long-term collaboration between the three principal investigators, students and post-doctoral trainees will be able to acquire expertise in more than one of the experimental approaches, interact with more than one mentor, and further, train explicitly in the emerging field of multisensory science, a field with few formal training opportunities."

An understanding of the physics of these exotic nuclei is required to interpret in a quantitative way a range of new X-ray binary observations from space based X-ray observatories. This will pave the way to address the many open questions such as the mechanism behind burst oscillations, the origin of superbursts, and the nature of the underlying neutron star. Very neutron deficient nuclei serve also as unique probes of nuclear structure. They provide tests for the limits of nuclear existence, and they show unique decay modes such as one- and two-proton emission. In addition, neutron deficient nuclei include a special class of nuclei - isotopes with equal numbers of protons and neutrons. As protons and neutrons occupy the same shell model orbitals, many nuclear structure effects appear enhanced in such nuclei. This is particularly true for one of the most neutron deficient, classically doubly magic nuclei in nature, 100Sn. Doubly-magic nuclei, where both, protons and neutrons completely fill a nuclear shell, are of particular importance in nuclear physics and serve as benchmarks and beachheads for nuclear theories. The measurement of the decay properties of 100Sn is by many considered one of the ""holy grails"" of nuclear physics and would provide unique insights into the beta-decay of heavy nuclei. <br/><br/>The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University has worldwide unique capabilities in producing extremely neutron deficient nuclei. This includes sufficient amounts of 100Sn to measure the properties of its decays,<br/>as well as all nuclei participating in the astrophysical rapid proton capture process in X-ray bursts. However, due to the nature of the projectile fragmentation mechanism used to create these nuclei, current experimental setups do not achieve the necessary beam purity.<br/>Many of the key experiments can therefore not be performed. We will build an RF Fragment Separator experiment, which will deflect unwanted rare isotope beam contaminants with an RF field, while transmitting the desired species. This device can be combined with existing experimental setups for decay and reaction studies and will allow a large group of graduate students and scientists to take full advantage of the production capabilities for neutron deficient beams at the NSCL to address fundamental questions in <br/>nuclear physics and astrophysics."

Because characters are affected by many genes, and because genes affect many characters, variation in different characters (e.g., arm length and leg length) are not independent of each other. The genetic variance-covariance matrix (G-matrix) summarizes these interdependencies. This study will estimate the G-matrix for eight species of Anolis lizards. Because species of these lizards on different islands have adapted to the same environment, this study will allow the comparison of distantly related species that have experienced the same natural selection pressures, as well as closely related species that live on the same island, but have experienced different selective pressures. These comparisons will permit evaluation of the factors that affect how the G-matrix evolves. <br/><br/>The G-matrix is of fundamental importance in describing evolutionary change by translating natural selection in one generation into phenotypic change in the next. Nonetheless, scientists still do not have a good understanding of what factors affect evolution of the G-matrix. By examining many species, this study will be the most extensive study to date and will thus greatly expand understanding of the genetics underlying evolutionary change. This project will support the training of a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and several undergraduates, including students from traditionally underrepresented groups. Anolis lizards have become one of the major models for studying evolutionary diversification and relaying that understanding to a broad audience. Accounts of Anolis evolution have appeared in countless textbooks, television programs and popular publications. This project will continue those efforts."

As sustained relief and recovery efforts are mounted, these unique features of local culture and social structure may prove to have an effect on the resilience of the affected communities, shaping and channeling the processes of recovery and reconstruction in specific locations. Increasing our understanding of the role of local cultural factors in disaster recovery will provide useful information for future global disaster planning and recovery efforts. This project compares two culturally, linguistically, and historically different coastal regions of Sri Lanka that were both very badly damaged by the tsunami. By looking at sub-regional differences in tsunami recovery efforts within a single nation-state such as Sri Lanka, it will be possible to distinguish the cultural components from the larger political, economic, and environmental dimensions of the post-tsunami situation. The design of the project will utilize in-depth anthropological fieldwork to explore how patterns of village life and traditional institutions of social healing have been affected by the tsunami experience in the Sinhala-speaking Buddhist and Catholic communities on the south coast of the island, and to compare this with corresponding information gathered in the Tamil-speaking Hindu and Muslim region on the eastern coast. To augment and corroborate the ethnographic data, a sociological survey of tsunami impacts and social indicators will be conducted in each of these coastal regions, and a political scientist will provide a broad scale analysis of Sri Lankan governmental relief efforts and the role played by NGOs. Like the Indonesian province of Aceh, Sri Lanka also has an ongoing internal guerrilla conflict that must be taken into account as well. By utilizing a five-person multidisciplinary team of researchers, and focusing on two culturally-distinct regions, this project will help social scientists to understand how local-level cultural factors can play a role in larger processes of disaster recovery."

The height of woodframe construction is currently limited to approximately four stories, due to the lack of understanding of the dynamic response of taller (mid-rise) woodframe construction, non-structural limitations such as material fire requirements, and potential damage considerations for non-structural finishes. Current building code requirements for engineered wood construction around the world are not based on a global seismic design philosophy.  Instead, wood elements are designed independently of each other without consideration of the influence that their stiffness and strength have on the other structural components of the structural system.  Furthermore, load paths in woodframe construction arising during earthquake shaking are not well understood. These factors, rather than economic considerations, have limited the use of wood to low-rise construction and have reduced the economical competitiveness of the wood industry in the United States and abroad relative to the steel and concrete industries. This project will develop a performance-based seismic design (PBSD) philosophy to safely increase the height of woodframe structures in active seismic zones of the United States as well as mitigating damage to low-rise woodframe structures.   During year one, full-scale seismic benchmark tests of a two-story woodframe townhouse will be performed using the two three-dimensional shake tables at the NEES SUNY-Buffalo equipment site. As the largest full-scale, three-dimensional shake table test performed in the United States, the test results will serve as a benchmark for both woodframe performance and nonlinear models for seismic analysis of woodframe structures.  These efficient analysis tools will provide a platform upon which to build the PBSD philosophy.  The PBSD methodology will rely on the development of key performance requirements such as limiting interstory deformations.  The method will incorporate the use of economical seismic protection systems such as supplemental dampers and base isolation systems in order to further increase energy dissipation capacity and/or increase the natural period of the woodframe buildings.  A real-time hybrid test will be performed by linking the fixed-based townhouse structure on the Buffalo NEES shake table with a reduced scale base isolation bearing tested simultaneously on a smaller shake table at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  The societal impacts of this new PBSD procedure, aimed at increasing the height of woodframe structures equipped with economical seismic protection systems, will also be investigated.  Once the PBSD philosophy for mid-rise woodframe structures has been developed, it will be applied to the seismic design of a mid-rise (five or six-story) multi-family residential woodframe apartment building.  This mid-rise woodframe structure will be constructed and tested at full-scale in a series of shake table tests on the Japanese E-Defense shake table in Miki City, Japan.  The use of the E-Defense shake table, the largest 3-D shake table in the world, is necessary to accommodate the height and payload of the mid-rise building.  There will be a request in the United States and in the international earthquake engineering community for payload projects to be conducted during this series of tests.  The intellectual merit of NEESWood is the development of a new design philosophy that will provide a logical, economical basis for the design of mid-rise woodframe construction. The broader impacts of NEESWood are that it will provide a seminal advancement in seismic design of woodframe construction as well as the full-scale seismic testing of structural systems including dynamic distributed testing between two sites.  When this challenge is successfully met, mid-rise woodframe construction may be an economic option in seismic regions around the United States and the world.<br/><br/>"

This project will entail systematic interviewing of a wide spectrum of<br/>participants on their role in the debate and their understanding of the issues at stake. The <br/>project will pay special attention to the absence from this debate of pertinent findings from <br/>historical and contemporary scholarship on women in science. The aim is to learn why the<br/>debate erupted when it did; why it will not go away; how can the public debate make <br/>contributions to the policy of improving gender equality in science; and how to ensure that <br/>past, present, and future scholarship on women in science become routinely accessible to <br/>decision makers and public debaters in an effective, engaging, and ongoing manner.<br/><br/>The project aims to bridge the gap between the actual availability of extensive scholarship on<br/>women in science in the last two decades, and its lack of representation as a crucial resource in<br/>public debates and routine policy making. The project contends that this gap is responsible to <br/>a large extent for delaying the impact of well meaning initiatives in public policy, as well as <br/>public understanding of why gender equity in science continues to lag despite efforts to address it. <br/><br/>The project will extract major themes from a wide range of participants in this debate by means of participant observation at organized debating events, conferences, and organizational initiatives, oral history interviews, and analysis of published literature on the topic. The PI will bring those themes to public attention by organizing a AAAS session on the topic, by circulating the lessons emanating from this debate in the form of a collective volume that will synthesize the myriad issues that surfaced in the course of the debate, and by informing the policy agenda for gender equality in science in the 21st Century with the authentic voices of a broader range of concerned participants. The project is both timely and time dependent. Many conferences and debates have recently taken place in response to the comments of Harvard President Larry Summers, and now is the time for the PI to take advantage of the opportunity to examine these issues. <br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the proposal include a gaining a better understanding of how<br/>interdisciplinary scholarship on women in science (by historians, social scientists, gender<br/>theorists, scientists, policy analysts, biographers) affects, or fails to affect, public opinion and<br/>structural changes in science. The broader impact of the project stems from its ability to detect<br/>unexpected obstacles to the diffusion and application of findings from basic academic research<br/>on women in science in the civic and policy arenas. Yet another source of broad impact stems<br/>form the project's enabling activity in highlighting a multitude of voices in and out of this debate, so as to enrich the sources of input into the critical issue of gender equality in both science and society."

This proposed effort will improve the PI's ability to predict the state of the near-earth heliospheric environment through a continuation and enhancement of the synoptic program of observations at the 150-foot solar tower on Mt. Wilson. Each clear day, the Mt. Wilson Observatory (MWO) program contributes up to twenty full disk magnetograms, and its daily measurements of the photospheric field are used operationally by the Space Environment Center of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) to predict the state of the near-earth heliosphere. The MWO provides a unique combination of good spatial resolution with a well-calibrated magnetic field zero point and a temporal coverage extending back to 1967. This proposal will enable the continuation of this project and the distribution of new data products to the community through a user-initiated, web-based retrieval process.<br/><br/>The proposer plans to investigate the commonly used potential theory model as the method of representing the magnetic field between the Sun and solar wind, and to investigate the possibility of estimating electric currents from line-of-sight magnetograms. He plans to use a method he developed for measuring the field's transverse component, after he compared observed transverse fields with fields derived from the potential field theory and found substantial disagreements. He discovered that if a different spectral line pair near the core of the sodium D line is used to make the basic magnetic field measurement, the problems with the potential field theory are reduced. This spectral line pair is formed at the base of the chromosphere instead of in the middle of the photosphere. <br/><br/>The PI will investigate the advantages of using this new line pair on a regular basis as an augmentation of MWO's regular data products. The combination of two or more spectral sampling pairs for the basic magnetic field measurement permits an estimation of vertical gradients in the field strength. By using his estimation of the transverse field components at different altitudes, the PI will estimate the component of the curl of the magnetic field in the north-south direction. This in turn will provide an estimate of photospheric electric currents, which have been found to be a predictor of coronal instability. The PI will investigate the locations of enhanced magnetic curl to learn about the magnetic configurations that lead to these currents."

The results will be published as a new edition of the earlier 1961 volume in the Anatomy of the Monocotyledons series. The new observations will be based on material collected from three American tropical botanic gardens with cultivated and readily accessible palms. This domestic resource avoids the difficult if not impossible task of collecting in many tropical countries due to local government restrictions. <br/>(2) How useful is anatomy in palm systematics? The new edition will provide anatomical characterizations including photographic plates. Information will be distilled as an interactive key with glossary and images and be widely accessible on the World Wide Web. Palm material and economic products will be identifiable to genus and in many cases species. Researchers in tropical biology and agriculture will refer to it.<br/>(3) What is the phylogenetic significance of anatomical characters? The palms are a distinctive and natural plant group in which molecular evidence for evolutionary relationships has not been related to morphology and anatomy. Anatomical data will be scored for cladistic analyses to help clarify palm systematics. Hypotheses about anatomical character evolution will be compared to molecular trees (now being determined in other cooperating labs) for congruence.<br/> Broader scientific significance and societal benefits: The proposed book and website will document and disseminate the improved understanding of palm structure and classification. New evolutionary hypotheses based on molecular data will be evaluated against the new structural data. Structural features can also be related to palm ecology. Palms are of global economic importance and of local value in the culture and life of tropical peoples. They serve as icons in the teaching of tropical botany. The anatomical compendium and website will assist in identification of palms for non-botanists (in ecology, archaeology, industry, agroforestry and forensic science) while providing a foundation for pathological and physiological studies. A postdoctoral fellow and graduate student will be trained; interpretive and educational materials will be distributed by the Fairchild Challenge Network to 30,000 U.S. school children, and globally, through botanic gardens with palm collections, partners in the IUCN Palm Specialist Group, the Global Trees Campaign, and the Global Palm Conservation Assessment. At Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, research results will be added to interpretive signs and tours presented to school children, teachers and the general public who visit the Garden."

Kujawinski - Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution<br/>The carbon cycle in aquifer systems, and particularly the role of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, is poorly understood. A large body of work in marine and freshwater systems has indicated that eukaryotes such as protozoa play fundamental roles in the carbon and nutrient cycles in all aquatic environments - ranging from nutrient-rich coastal systems to nutrient-poor mid-ocean gyres. Nevertheless, the role of protozoa in aquifer systems has been examined by a relatively small number of studies. Given the pivotal role these organisms play in other aquatic environments, it is reasonable to assume that they play fundamental roles in the carbon and nutrient cycles of the subsurface. It is time to investigate which protozoan species are present, which bacteria they graze upon and the impact of protozoan grazing on the carbon and nutrient cycles in groundwater. The goal of this work is to utilize stable isotopes in combination with geochemical and microbial methods to study the effect of protozoa on nutrient regeneration rates and carbon remineralization in a subterranean estuary on Cape Cod MA. This work will use 13C-labeled substrates such as acetate to track the active bacterial and protozoan community. Sediment will be collected from the freshwater and saline end-members of the subterranean estuary and will be used to establish flow-through columns. These columns will be incubated with groundwater pumped from the appropriate site in the estuary to maintain the in situ salinity and ion composition. Groundwater will be amended with 13C-substrates. The movement of the isotopic label from substrate to organic matter will be monitored by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry of inorganic carbon (aqueous CO2 species), bulk organic carbon (TOC / DOC) and small organic molecules (volatile organic acids and amino acids). Incorporation of the label into microbial biomass will be assessed by examination of isotopically-labeled nucleic acids and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Active bacterial and protozoan species will be identified by their isotopically-labeled rDNA or rRNA sequence. The relative roles of protozoa and bacteria will be assessed by parallel column incubations with 1.0-um filtered and non-filtered groundwater. The proposed work is the first study, to our knowledge, that directly links protozoan community composition to nutrient regeneration and carbon remineralization in fresh and saline aquifers. This group of microbes is vastly under-studied and the results of this study have the potential to elucidate recycling processes outside the current paradigm of microbial activity in aquifer sediments. Furthermore, the methods developed here can be generally applied to ecological and biogeochemical studies in numerous environments, ranging from freshwater systems to marine sediments."

Today traffic flows continue to rapidly outpace resources available to society for improving the transportation infrastructure, and better management of existing facilities would be a cost effective way for resolving the problem. Since congestion depends on the policies chosen by the traffic authorities, and on the social interaction of individuals as drivers and passengers, analyzing congestion requires an integrated approach that allows for different viewpoints: the transportation agencies', the consumers', as well as the perspective of society as a whole. The primary objective of this research is to find an optimal mix of strategies that will spread traffic congestion over geographical space and time by better utilization of current resources, thereby reducing its costs. These strategies, such as dynamic pricing or highway reservation methods, have either been implemented in few selected areas in the United States, or have been discussed conceptually; however, their effects on travel and the urban infrastructure are not well understood. We propose to bring together tools from economics, systems engineering, and transportation engineering for a comprehensive analysis of the congestion problem. A number of concurrent objectives will be pursued in this research, which involves artificial intelligence models of users' transportation services, a set of economic experiments to evaluate different transportation policies, a model of the interaction of social networks and transportation choices, and a system dynamics analysis of transportation and social networks and their dynamic evolution. The successful completion of this research will have the potential to lead to new paradigms of traffic analysis and to a new understanding of the linkages between transportation, the urban infrastructure and ultimately the regional economy."

The band-gap engineering of nanophosphors allows improvement in the luminescence characteristics such as absorption and emission spectra, half-width, efficiency, life-time, etc. Indeed the role of conventional activators (rare-earths and transition metal impurities) in nanophosphors can be re-evaluated for different applications. Specifically, ternary wide band gap semiconductors such as ZnCdS with dopants like Ag, Cu, Mn offer very efficient broad-band visible spectra that is close to white light. The possibility of band-gap engineering in nanocrystals of ternary semiconductors, similar to that catapulted the optoelectronic devices from III-V semiconductors, opens the door to design of new nanophosphors that match well with the excitation spectra of LED's and compact fluorescent lamps. This development would lead to a new class of white light sources in this Phase II project. By developing different nanophosphors that can be excited by blue/UV LEDs, it successfully demonstrates that nanophosphors can significantly enhance the performance of not only white LEDs but also can improve the performance of compact fluorescent and arc lamps. <br/><br/>Commercially this technological breakthrough of engineering of nanophosphors when used with current efficient lamps, is expected to enhance the efficiency of LED's by 40% and lamps by 15%, respectively. These improvements in overall power efficiency of these lamps, will significantly lower the cost of energy used and it is projected will help to save energy costs equivalent to $25 billion by 2025."

Most of this change will occur over the next 30 years, as 77 million baby boomers cease to work and pay payroll taxes and instead start to retire and collect benefits."" The growing numbers of elderly individuals in need of supports to live in the community will severely test the current services infrastructure. Part of the answer is to develop technological innovations that allow a sensitive and intelligent augmentation to empower an elder population to successfully ""age in place."" However, it is essential to understand the needs of the target community before encouraging large investments in research leading to exotic, new technologies. Rather, this issue can best be addressed by integrating the knowledge and perspectives of social science, computer science, and in partnership with potential elderly recipients of the technology. Through such an approach, social scientists can best understand the potential of the technology, examine the ways aging clients might use it in their own context, address the learning transition into their effective use, and determine what challenges must be overcome for success. Technologists can provide reconfigurable experimental systems supporting field tests designed to provide empirical data that can be used as dynamic feedback into this analysis. Together,<br/>these synergistic activities can provide systems for studying the broader introduction of technology to the aging population. This proposal addresses the concern that those who have been developing assistive technology have not been sufficiently involved at ""ground level"" with the elders themselves or with their families or service systems. In addition, collaboration between social scientists and computer scientists has been rare; yet, social science can tap into the theoretical foundations of behavior and identify those issues which are likely to facilitate and obstruct the introduction of assistive technology to the elderly. Therefore, an interdisciplinary and integrative approach proposed here is essential to a positive outcome.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This proposal brings together social scientists and geriatric social work practitioners from Smith College and computer scientists who have expertise in computer vision, robotics, and human computer interaction from the University of Massachusetts and Mitsubishi Electrical Research Laboratory (MERL). An ecosystemic perspective will be used to study the effective utility of computer based technology for enhancing capacity in the elderly to ""age in place"" or live independently. Many of the issues examined in this study will be informed by the long-standing research tradition of environmental gerontology which examines the impact of physical, social, organizational and cultural environments on aging processes and outcomes. In order to assist the elderly in engaging comfortably with new technology, it is essential to enhance their sense of agency and control and thus promote empowerment; therefore, enhancing a sense of control for the elderly will be a critical element of the way in which technology is introduced. We will also examine the unique cognitive and learning issues for older adults in mastering new technology and will attend, as well, to the ethical issues raised by the introduction of technology. The technologists will provide reconfigurable experimental systems supporting field tests designed to provide empirical findings with respect to the technology. Together,these synergistic activities can provide systems molded to the precise needs and desires of the aging population - systems that are ultimately based on carefully conducted research and trial.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The technological innovations studied and developed here have great potential to reduce depression risk as a result of increased stimulation of cognition, reduction of social isolation, improvement in self care and greater sense of self efficacy, and to significantly improve the quality of care afforded the elderly. The results of this research will guide scientists and engineers in the introduction of technology to the rapidly growing and highly vulnerable population of elderly. We expect it will point the way to significant cost reduction while increasing the quality of care for senior citizens. Furthermore, the lead research team is from an undergraduate women's college that has an elite graduate program for training social workers. It will bring women undergraduates into research contact with Ph.D. and MSW graduate students and faculty and prepare them for the coming technological revolution in elderly care."

One of these compounds is indole-3-acetic acid, an important member of the class of plant growth regulators called auxins. Indole-3-acetic acid is synthesized by virtually all plant species. In the cruciferous plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, tryptophan is also used to produce the plant defense compounds indole glucosinolates (IGs) and camalexin. There is evidence in Arabidopsis for intricate cross-talk between the biosynthetic pathways used to produce these different tryptophan-derived compounds. The secondary metabolite profile in the non-crucifer tobacco does not include IGs or camalexin. Thus, tobacco provides a tractable alternative model system in which Trp metabolism can be compared to that of Arabidopsis.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand how the interactions among tryptophan metabolism pathways are the same or different between Arabidopsis and other plant species that do not produce the same spectrum of tryptophan-derived compounds as Arabidopsis. The research scope of this project is twofold:<br/>1) Use previously identified mutant plants perturbed in tryptophan metabolism to define the role of compounds predicted to serve as intermediate steps for the biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid. In addition, new mutants disrupted in these metabolic pathways will be identified.<br/>2) Determine which known indole-3-acetic acid biosynthetic pathways contribute to the formation of a chemically distinct naturally occurring auxin called indole-3-butyric acid. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include the training of graduate students in biochemical and genetic methodologies. This training will prepare them for more advanced positions in the fields of plant biochemistry and metabolomics. In addition, this research will be carried out as collaboration among three institutions (University of Massachusetts Amherst, Boston University and Lincoln University) that are partner institutions in an NSF-supported alliance designed to increase the number of minorities in the professoriate of science technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Interactions between the three labs will be facilitated by having students from Lincoln University participate in ongoing summer minority research programs in the laboratories of the PIs from University of Massachusetts and Boston University. Co-mentorship of Lincoln University students among the three PIs will facilitate the identification, recruiting and mentoring of minority students with an interest in plant biology graduate programs."

Such problems appear in oceanography, but also in meteorology, economics, engineering, and all fields in which complex simulations are carried out. Automatic differentiation (AD) tools have proved extremely powerful in determining model sensitivities to perturbations in initial and boundary conditions, as well as in internal parameters. AD is critical in recent efforts to bring these models into consistency with modern, massive global data sets (state estimation or ""data assimilation"" in meteorology). However, sensitivities alone are of limited value for characterizing model behavior. The proposed research on uncertainty quantification represents a qualitative advance in our understanding of the models and will ultimately guide model improvements; this requires new mathematical approaches for eigen-solvers, Hessian computations, and non-smooth optimization to handle the computationally complex models.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit This project seeks to gain deep new insight into geophysical models and the uncertainty inherent in the state estimation of geophysical systems. Without them it is impossible to attribute problems encountered in such models to either non-smooth formulation of the model numerics, or to theoretical limits of the underlying smooth dynamical system. However, significant advances are needed in the algorithms used for uncertainty quantification, which necessitate computing the eigen-solutions of the large, dense Hessians that characterize geophysical models. Substantial advances in automatic differentiation algorithms for computing Hessian-vector products, coupled with novel pre-conditioners based on quasi-Newton updates and scale probing are expected to enable an efficient characterization of the numerical uncertainties. Furthermore, advances in state estimation for highly discontinuous systems, achieved via the use of non-smooth optimization algorithms and corresponding advances in differentiation algorithms, will provide insight into the model uncertainties introduced through the use of non-smooth parameterization schemes. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts Numerical models are used in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems, including geophysics; economics; physics; mechanical, nuclear, aeronautical and chemical engineering; and medicine. The complexity of these models, which are typically used in simulation mode, increases over time until no single individual understands how and why the code responds to changes in external or internal parameters. The proposed mathematical algorithms and AD methods will produce sensitivity tests that are computationally feasible even in very large scale problems. Often, the model state simulations are combined with a wide variety of observations so as to produce best estimates of the true state. AD tools have proven extremely useful in enabling the resulting extremely large optimization problem to be solved by using gradient-based optimization algorithms. The proposed work addresses both discontinuities and nonlinearities in large scale models, offering insights that will benefit a wide class of problems where uncertainty quantification has previously been intractable. This project will provide the mathematical and computational tools so that researchers can evaluate model uncertainties in near-automatic fashion. To maximize their availability and impact all algorithms will be implemented as open source software."

Metaphorical statements can be used to describe an attitude object or issue (e.g., Drug abuse is a social cancer) or a person (e.g., Saddam Hussein is a contemporary Hitler). Yet, scientific research that examines how metaphor influences persuasion and impression formation is severely lacking. The proposed research is designed to fill this gap in the scientific literature. This research focuses on four core theoretical hypotheses. (1) When used appropriately, metaphorical language provides the listener with a coherent image of the communication topic that helps the listener to better understand and think about a communication. (2) On the other hand, inappropriate use of metaphor can actually reduce comprehension of a communication and interfere with the listener's ability to carefully think about a communication topic. (3) Metaphorical language can provide the listener with a unified or holistic image of the communication topic, and thereby increase the listener's ability to think about the communication topic in an efficient and integrated manner. (4) Metaphorical language can elicit an epiphany in the listener, and thereby stimulate interest in the communication topic. Specific predictions derived on the basis of these four core hypotheses will be examined in eight scientific experiments. <br/><br/>This research will be of value not only to social psychologists; but also linguists, communication researchers, political scientists, political strategists, marketers, advertisers, education researchers, supervisors, and counselors. The findings of this research can be used to develop communication strategies that facilitate learning in educational settings, facilitate the dissemination of health information to the mass public, increase the effectiveness of inter-cultural communication, increase communication effectiveness between therapists (or counselors) and their clients, and increase the public's motivation and ability to carefully evaluate political communications. The present research also provides a foundation for future work that examines the metaphorical underpinnings of stereotyping, and the implementation of communication strategies that can be used to reduce prejudice and discrimination. The present research will also provide research training and/or educational support for graduate (Ph.D.) students, and help introduce hundreds of university research participants to the field of social psychology."

This effort will advance the knowledge and understanding of Arctic sea ice and how its distribution varies both spatially and temporally. Because ice thickness data are significantly autocorrelated and have distributions that differ markedly from the Gaussian (normal) distribution, standard statistical tests for assessing changes in distributions cannot be used. The proposed effort simplifies the nature of the non-Gaussianity by partitioning the ice measurements into different types according to thickness (new, first year, medium multiyear and ridged). This partitioning leads to series that are binary-valued, thus yielding a simple non-Gaussian distribution with which to deal. Tests of differences in ice type distributions then serve as surrogates for tests of differences in the more complicated ice thickness distributions. In addition, the largest observed component of the wavelet analysis can be used to define a characteristic scale for an ice type. Spatial and temporal variations in this characteristic scale provide another characterization of how Arctic sea ice varies, which is complementary to variations captured by ice type distributions. The proposed effort will also establish a rigorous statistical theory for evaluating changes in characteristic scales. <br/><br/>Variations in sea ice distribution is often viewed as and indicator of climate variation. Better characterization of this spatial and temporal variability will improve an important signal of climate variability."

The effort to understand the mathematical, functional basis of effective decision and control in the brain is perhaps one of the most important, fundamental challenges before science in general.<br/><br/>Broader Benefits: Cross-disciplinary communication between the most advanced areas of technology and the serious study of intelligence in the brain is still far less than it could be. If successful, this project could have a major impact on the unification of knowledge across disciplines. Aggressive education and dissemination are a natural part of the effort to heal the gap between disciplines related to these scientific goals.<br/>Better understanding of biomechanical issues may also have important benefits both in medicine and in robots.<br/>"

Higher-fidelity mathematical models, higher-order approximation methods, and faster solution algorithms have been developed for many applications. Computing speed barriers have also been shattered by hardware manufacturers. As a result, the potential of modeling and simulation for reducing design-cycle time and enhancing system performance is recognized today in almost every field of engineering. However, for many complex structural systems, even the most elaborate computational models remain bound to be imperfect for numerous reasons. The Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) concept is a unique paradigm for exploiting maturing computational and sensor networking technologies to compensate for model deficiencies and unforeseen system evolution and stimulus conditions, mitigate the effect of design imperfections on long-term as well as short-term system safety, and enable informed decision for maintenance planning and crisis management.<br/><br/>This project will design, implement, build, and demonstrate by simulations as well as by laboratory experiments a DDDAS for health monitoring, failure prediction, and crisis management of complex structural systems operating in various time-scales. The project will enable advances in: (i) Applications: Development of inverse algorithms for generating hybrid analytical, computational, and data-updated models representing the behavior of degrading systems at various time-scales; (ii) Application Measurement Systems and Methods: Development of methods for preserving autonomous sensor network infrastructure in highly dynamic environments, preserving routing capabilities and time synchronization in the presence of system damage or degradation, sensor scoring and self-consistency checks, and dynamic models for reducing simulator-sensor node communication; (iii) Mathematical and Statistical Algorithms: Development of innovative algorithms for on-line identification of degrading systems, damage tracking, stable adaptive reduced-order modeling, and near real-time computing, and (iv) Systems Software Infrastructure: Development of a proof of concept software architecture that encapsulates all the advances in the above areas and furthermore addresses the issue of dynamically selecting and optimizing at run-time components of heterogeneous functionality over heterogeneous computing resources. Development of real-time, data driven, redundancy exploitation schemes for addressing the service quality degradation of wired and wireless sensor networks embedded in multidisciplinary systems, as a function of operating conditions.<br/><br/>A unique feature of the proposed research is a set of test-beds and associated laboratory experiments conceived not only to demonstrate the envisioned DDDAS, but also to support a strong educational component of the project."

Beach of the University of Kansas Center for Research and Dr. Julio Ibarra of Florida International University. The workshop, which will be jointly sponsored by various science agencies of Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica and Colombia, will be concerned with applications of new tools and working methodologies to biodiversity. These tools derive from advances in computing, related information technologies, and the growing infrastructure-the cyberinfrastructure-that is currently under development globally. The workshop will be held in Panama City, early in January 2006 and will explore opportunities and breakthrough activities with the aim of promoting future collaborations in biodiversity informatics and research. <br/><br/>Prior to the availability of ubiquitous data network connectivity, biodiversity research collaborations required face-to-face professional interactions in the form of field work, in-residence stays, or other kinds of visits, and relied mainly on paper documents and mail for remote coordination and communication. Today many research communities, including the systematics, phylogenetics and ecology communities, are on the cusp of transformative change as a consequence of network capacity that will enable a new class of research collaboration based on instant interaction with networked information servers and computational services, in a paradigm known as ""Grid Computing."" High throughput international backbones linking desktops of scientists around the world will help launch a new class of research collaborations with scientists ""wired together"" in a virtual, global, biodiversity collaboration environment.<br/><br/>To set the stage and prepare for this transformation in research communications among North and Central American countries, the workshop will include 40-50 invited leading biology researchers, cyberinfrastructure technologists, and funding agency representatives from the United States, Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, Colombia, and various other Central American countries. It will be focused on identifying activities that will enable North and Central American partnerships and collaborations. Outcomes will include recommendations for follow-on activities and suggestions for investments to promote international informatics collaboration. The broader impacts of the meeting will, ultimately, lead to new modes of collaboration, supporting biodiversity research and analysis for policy and planning, to better understand the ecological and societal impacts of global biodiversity. This workshop is being jointly supported by the Division of Environmental Biology, the Office of Cyberinfrastructure, and the Office of International Science and Engineering."

They also have tremendous conservation value, housing the world's remaining large grazing animals, particularly in Africa. A fundamental understanding of the factors most important for sustaining savanna grasslands, fire and grazing, is required for their management and conservation. Yet scientists have questioned whether grasslands in different regions function similarly. Convergence in function would mean that ecological understanding and conservation strategies could be generalized worldwide. But contingent factors specific to a region, such as differences in history or the types of grazers present may lead to unique responses in some savanna grasslands. The goal of this research is to compare key ecological processes to fire and grazing in savanna grasslands in North America and South Africa. Scientists will take advantage of three ongoing long-term experiments that manipulate these key factors and compare responses in productivity, biodiversity, and nutrient cycling. <br/><br/>As humans alter fire and grazing regimes worldwide, comparative research elucidating the consequences is needed to develop management strategies that can insure the sustainability of savanna grasslands. This research will provide the basic knowledge necessary to do so, and will afford training and important global and cultural experiences for young scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students."

The metallic contacts will form ohmic contacts to molecular devices for circuits from DC to microwave frequencies. Precisely fabricated, ultrasmall gaps are not needed since the overall hybrid structure will be much longer than the organic molecule of interest. At optical frequencies, the metallic contacts will form an electromagnetic cavity around the molecular device, enhancing optical fields to be utilized in single-molecule spectroscopic measurements. Self-assembly of these new nanoscale objects will be investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Electrical devices will be fabricated to study charge transport through single molecules. New electrical, optical and physical phenomenon may arise from these unique nanoscale structures. The open planar geometry formed in this work is expected to allow electrostatic modification of electronic states using a nearby strongly-coupled gate electrode, and will reduce fluorescence quenching by nearby metallic electrodes. Single-molecule based transistors and light-emitting diodes may be generated from the proposed structures. The methods developed will lay the groundwork for developing molecular electronic and optical devices and integrating them into complex circuits. <br/>Intellectual Merit. Fundamental advances across disciplines are essential to the advancement of nanoscale devices and to understanding their behavior. Molecular synthesis, self-assembly, and charge transport are essential components for realizing nanoscale devices with organic molecules. A coordinated team attack on such issues can advance the state of single-molecule devices. This project will be carried out by a team of two chemists, one solid-state physicist, one spectroscopist, and one theorist together with collaborators from industry, national labs, and foreign universities with expertise in polymer synthesis, surface chemistry, biochemistry, DNA self-assembly, DNA metallization, spectroscopy, charge transport, fluid dynamics simulation, and device fabrication. <br/>Broader Impacts. This project may result in a new approach to make electrical contacts to single molecules, which will allow study of charge transport through single molecules with different chemical functionalities and length as well as measurement of unique optical properties arising from a single molecule confined in a nanogap. The proposed work will not only answer fundamental questions of intramolecular charge transport mechanisms in molecules with length scale of 5-100 nm, it will also provide answers to technological questions of whether organic molecules have sufficient performance for nanoelectronics and whether the mobility of molecular devices will be dramatically increased by alignment of organic semiconducting molecules between electrodes. This project also utilizes methods to self- assemble DNA-polymer-DNA and nanoparticle-molecule-nanoparticle structures using electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis to allow electrical connections to be made to single organic semiconducting molecules. The PIs will work closely with existing NSF centers and the Stanford Office of Science Outreach to reach a broad population ranging from K-12, community college, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as to prepare teachers of tomorrow for new areas of science and technology. Two internship positions every year for minority and/or women community college students are integral to the project. One research position per year will also be provided to a middle school or high school teacher during the summer; PIs will continue to work with them to develop their education plans after their summer research. PIs will also reach out to the general public through a public website and participation in various community events. The graduate students and postdoc involved in the project will actively interact with each other and have the opportunity to interact with researchers from industry, national labs, and international collaborators. They will be well equipped with a combination of technical engineering skills, basic scientific understanding, and communication skills, and poised to contribute to nanoscience and nanotechnology."

This project connects pedagogic materials to teaching materials in digital library collections. It is helping teachers and faculty understand how to use STEM materials in ways that are engaging, interesting, and effective, embodying key principles of teaching and learning. The project is building on a successful example, the Starting Point Digital Library, a design that ensures that seekers of teaching materials also find pedagogic information, and vice versa. A new set of tools is being created to enable other digital libraries to link the pedagogic materials developed by this project to teaching materials in their library while establishing mechanisms for creating a much broader collection of pedagogic materials and examples. Service users will also be able to develop customized pedagogic portals with pedagogic materials of high interest to their community linked to examples relevant to their users drawn from both their collections and the shared example collection. The service is designed to be customizable by NSDL projects so that it can be adapted to meet the interests and needs of their communities and be integrated seamlessly into their library. The shared collection of pedagogic materials and teaching examples will foster sharing and reuse of content across the NSDL and promote movement of library users between NSDL collections and portals. This service is being developed as a built-in partnership with five NSDL projects and two campus centers for teaching and learning; these are implementing the service and contributing to the shared collection. This work is the basis for a generalized service that will be rolled out for use across the NSDL in the third year of the project. <br/>Broader Impact: This project fills a recognized gap between instructors finding excellent materials and knowing how to use them effectively. Partnerships with campus centers for teaching and learning are extending the reach of this project. As a focus for faculty professional development on individual campuses, such centers both provide pedagogic information for their faculty and share the advances taking place on their campuses. By integrating this key NSDL service into the websites of campus centers for teaching and learning, the NSDL is being brought onto campus and widely disseminated. Exploring its use in course management systems, a primary tool used by faculty when designing and delivering their courses, is also extending the reach of this service. <br/><br/>NSF Support: The Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Earth Sciences in the NSF Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) are providing co-funding for this project in recognition of its potential value in integrating research and education in the mathematical, physical, and earth sciences."

Human spatial behavior, individual and collective, depends on the structure of the environment, the structure and content of cognitive representations of the environment (mental maps), individual and group goals, and interactions among individuals, groups, and crowds. As a result, human spatial behavior needs to be studied by considering all these aspects together; to do this requires a multidisciplinary effort. The proposed research brings together a team of researchers representing diverse disciplines of computation, psychology, and mathematics into an integrated program that will address human individual and collective use of physical space.<br/> This project's multidisciplinary effort uses the tools of cognitive science, computational modeling, and mathematical analysis of collective behavior to study the dynamics of human spatial behavior. The project's goals are as follows: <br/>1) To understand how individuals develop cognitive maps of complex environments in real-world situations that include rich spatial interactions with other people, individually and in groups; <br/>2) To examine how cognitive maps influence the behavior of groups in high-density crowd conditions, and to develop the cognitive foundations for models of pedestrian dynamics and emergency evacuations; <br/>3) To forge a mathematical link between microscopic (small scale) and macroscopic (large scale) models of adaptive human social behavior in spatial tasks. <br/>The research program will develop novel cognitive map-driven models that will include the shared spatial information that individual people derive from social interactions. The models will be used to improve simulations of individuals and crowds, and provide a basis for mathematical analysis of collective spatial behavior dynamics. Validation and evaluation will exploit virtual reality technology, computer simulations of crowd behavior, and people's behavior in real environments. Through partnerships with two museums, the team will be working with real-world situations whose relevance to societal needs includes the design of emergency evacuation systems, automated detection of anomalies in large spaces and crowds, and the development of complex but human-friendly environments. The generation, validation, and free dissemination of powerful predictive models that will be developed will allow architects, planners, and developers of public spaces to design and/or modify public venues so as to optimize their navigability and safety. Finally, a comprehensive program of education, outreach, and dissemination will serve a broad audience of graduate and undergraduate students, inner-city K-12 students and teachers, and the general public will accompany the research."

We will determine the effectiveness of ICS during Hurricane Katrina by drawing upon the perceptions of disaster managers using ICS, and comparing the formal standards of effectiveness within ICS documents to actual behavior. This first scientific look at ICS should provide at least two crucial outcomes. First, we will establish what improvements, if any, are needed with ICS and more broadly with NIMS.

Three outstanding problems that will be addressed are (1) the existence of multiple conflicting theories for the mechanisms and interactions of CCEWs and the MJO, (2) the inadequacy of representations of CCEWs and MJOs in global models, and (3) uncertainties in the behavior of oceanic Kelvin waves forced by MJO-related wind perturbations.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The PI will perform: (1) the analysis of the existence of multiple conflicting theories for the mechanisms and interactions of CCEWs and the MJO; (2) evaluate the inadequacy of representations of CCEWs and MJOs in GCMs; and (3) the analysis of uncertainties in the behavior of oceanic Kelvin waves forced by MJO-related wind perturbations. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research will improve our observational understanding of CCEWs and will lead to improved general circulation model simulations. This project will prepare two graduate students for careers in atmospheric sciences."

This interdisciplinary education and research training project for undergraduates in biological and mathematical sciences will recruit junior undergraduate students, with half majoring in biology, and the others in mathematics (including statistics). The research will be directed towards qualitative and quantitative approaches to understanding molecular structures and mechanisms. This includes dynamics and regulation of the pathways and networks involved in gene expression and signal transduction in cells. It will involve using technical strategies from biochemistry, genetics and cellular biology, and mathematical tools such as DNA and protein microarray analysis, data mining, dynamical systems, numerical simulation, and partial differential equations. The students will assimilate and employ these mathematical techniques under the direction of faculty from the Department of Mathematics, and the Department of Statistics and Probability. Beyond providing intense education and research training to the participating undergraduates, this project will influence the future direction of curriculum changes.<br/><br/>The importance of the mathematical sciences in the development of 21st Century biology has been noted, just as they have been important in the past development of physical sciences and engineering. Yet the traditional training of biologists and that of mathematical scientists did not expose one population to the tools, problems, opportunities for progress, and challenges of the other. This project will train budding mathematical scientists in cutting-edge biology and will train undergraduate biology majors in quantitative analysis relevant to the fields of genetics and cell biology. The particular research projects being addressed by these students under the guidance of faculty in the biological and mathematical sciences include mathematical analysis of processes within cells, such as communication between parts of the cell and the assembly of the molecules necessary for proper life functions. The mathematical description of molecular processes allows for the simulation of these highly complex mechanisms, which brings understanding that could otherwise be unavailable. The mathematical description on the other hand, relies upon careful laboratory experimental work and data analysis, and so it is essential that future scientists be trained in both the laboratory approach and the mathematical approach to research into cellular and genetic processes. This integrative analysis and understanding should help in devising novel therapies to treat human diseases such as cancer, Huntington's, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease."

This requires dynamic integration of time-varying measurements of flow, pressure and contaminant concentration with analytical modules including models to simulate the state of the system, statistical methods for adaptive sampling, and optimization methods to search for efficient control strategies. For realistic distribution systems, the analytical modules are highly compute-intensive, requiring multi-level parallel processing via computer clusters. While data often drive the analytical modules, data needs for improving the accuracy and certainty of the solutions generated by these modules dynamically change when a contamination event unfolds. Since such time-sensitive threat events require real-time responses, the computational needs must also be adaptively matched with available resources. Thus, a software system is needed to facilitate this integration via a high-performance computing architecture (e.g., the TeraGrid) such that the measurement system, the analytical modules and the computing resources can mutually adapt and steer each other. The goal of this multi-disciplinary research is to develop a cyberinfrastructure system that will both adapt to and control changing needs in data, models, computer resources and management choices facilitated by a dynamic workflow design. Using virtual simulation and a field study, this cyberinfrastructure will be tested on illustrative scenarios for adaptive management of contamination events in water distribution systems.<br/><br/>Urban water distribution systems are vulnerable to accidental and intentional contamination incidents that could result in adverse human health and safety impacts. The pipe network in a typical municipal distribution system includes redundant flow paths to ensure service when parts of the network are unavailable, and is designed with significant storage to deliver water during daily peak demand periods. Thus, a typical network is highly interconnected and experiences significant and frequent fluctuations in flows and transport paths. These design features unintentionally enable contamination at a single point in the system to spread rapidly via different pathways through the network, unbeknown to consumers and operators. When a contamination event is detected via the first line of defense, e.g., data from a water quality surveillance sensor network and reports from consumers, the municipal authorities are faced with several critical questions as the contamination event unfolds: Where is the source of contamination? When and for how long did this contamination occur? Where additional hydraulic or water quality measurements should be taken to pinpoint the source more accurately? What is the current and near future extent of contamination? What response action, such as shutting down portions of the network, implementing hydraulic control strategies, or introducing decontaminants, should be taken to minimize the impact of the contamination event? What would be the impact on consumers by these actions? Real-time answers to such complex questions will present significant computational challenges. This project will address these challenges by developing an adaptive cyberinfrastucture that will enable real-time processing and control through dynamic integration of computational components and real-time sensor data. This system will be evaluated using contamination scenarios based on field-scale data from a large metropolitan area."

This proposal is concerned with two ripple effects from the hurricane: structural damage to industrial facilities, and releases of hazardous materials from compromised facilities. The approach used for the work to be accomplished in this project includes: visits to industrial facilities to observe damage and release sites first hand; use of non-destructive testing equipment to look for further signs of damage; interviews with industrial facility managers, response personnel, and/or environmental regulators regarding chemical releases and response to them; and data analysis including mapping, development of quantitative explanatory relationships, and case studies of hazmat releases and response. In addition, the data will be used to help design an environmental justice study and to ground-truth satellite imagery of the damaged structural facilities.<br/><br/><br/>The issues explored in this study are particularly important on the Gulf Coast, where hurricanes are frequent, industrial facilities are numerous, and a large portion of the population is relatively poor with few resources to fall back upon when catastrophe threatens. However, the importance of addressing these issues is not limited solely to the Gulf Coast - other hazard-prone areas with large industrial bases and vulnerable populations, such as southern California, are similarly threatened and can profit from the lessons learned from the industrial experiences along the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina. By providing analyses of damage and hazmat releases at industrial facilities as a result of Hurricane Katrina, the project results will provide valuable knowledge about how to protect industrial facilities from structural damage and hazardous material releases during major hurricanes. The adoption of efficacious protection and response measures will result in less damage to these facilities, and a reduction in the likelihood and/or severity of hazmat releases. It will also help to prioritize resources in terms of mitigation and response measures. The analysis of satellite imagery will help to improve the utility of these data in future disasters, and the environmental justice component of the project will help to address issues regarding the socio-economic distribution of disaster impacts in the United States."

KLEWICKI<br/>INSTITUTION: UNIVERSITY OF UTAH<br/><br/><br/>SCALING AND DYNAMICS OF BOUNDARY LAYER TURBULENCE<br/><br/>The proposed research is motivated by the direct empirical observations derived from measurements at very high Reynolds number at the Surface Layer Turbulence and Environmental Science Test (SLTEST) facility in Utah's west desert, and upon the newly developed theoretical foundation for turbulent wall flow based directly on the properties of the mean momentum equation. With regard to both of these, a central technical theme has been the understanding and characterizing behavior of the motions involved in generating Reynolds stress gradients. With the new insights derived from this information, a set of experiments were designed to address fundamental unresolved issues concerning wall turbulence, as follows: 1) the inner/outer interaction, 2) the connections between coherent motion dynamics and mean momentum transport, and 3) the connections between mean flow structure and the scaling of turbulence quantities. The effort will focus on the latter item with a primary component devoted to further measurements at the SLTEST facility. The greatest impact of the newly developed theory will most likely be related to an improved capacity to scale turbulence statistics. Experiments at the SLTEST facility have very broad and long-term impact. The breadth stems from the efforts of the PI to encourage others to join the yearly field experiments, and thus gain a high level of efficiency relating to both the technical benefits associated with collaborations, and in terms of high research productivity. The long-term impact derives from the fact that the facility offers unique capabilities to produce well-resolved turbulence measurements at high Reynolds numbers which are unavailable in any current laboratory facility. In addition to graduate student researchers, the PI anticipates involving undergraduate students funded under the REU program. Undergraduates have proven to be an especially important component to the yearly field trial research effort. The results will be disseminated and widely accessible to the research community via a web site developed under an NSF ITR grant."

Today traffic flows continue to rapidly outpace resources available to society for improving the transportation infrastructure, and better management of existing facilities would be a cost effective way for resolving the problem. Since congestion depends on the policies chosen by the traffic authorities, and on the social interaction of individuals as drivers and passengers, analyzing congestion requires an integrated approach that allows for different viewpoints: the transportation agencies', the consumers', as well as the perspective of society as a whole. The primary objective of this research is to find an optimal mix of strategies that will spread traffic congestion over geographical space and time by better utilization of current resources, thereby reducing its costs. These strategies, such as dynamic pricing or highway reservation methods, have either been implemented in few selected areas in the United States, or have been discussed conceptually; however, their effects on travel and the urban infrastructure are not well understood. We propose to bring together tools from economics, systems engineering, and transportation engineering for a comprehensive analysis of the congestion problem. A number of concurrent objectives will be pursued in this research, which involves artificial intelligence models of users' transportation services, a set of economic experiments to evaluate different transportation policies, a model of the interaction of social networks and transportation choices, and a system dynamics analysis of transportation and social networks and their dynamic evolution. The successful completion of this research will have the potential to lead to new paradigms of traffic analysis and to a new understanding of the linkages between transportation, the urban infrastructure and ultimately the regional economy."

Ecological restoration thus represents a practical way to replenish or augment current stocks of natural capital and flows of ecosystem goods and services, while also providing direct benefit for human wellbeing in the form of job creation and various immaterial benefits (e.g., social, cultural, and spiritual). Until now, many economists have taken cognizance of ecological engineering but not of ecological restoration, whose goal is to recover autogenic (self-sustaining) systems requiring few management and maintenance inputs. Moreover, despite their obvious complementarities, there has been little interaction-let alone cross-fertilization-between economics and restoration ecology to date. This grant will support an international Symposium that will bring together a large portion of the people who have considered these issues, from a range of different intellectual and cultural perspectives. The goal is to develop a clear rationale a) for doing restoration ecology on the conceptual basis of natural capital, and b) for actual investments of financial and human capital in the hands-on replenishment of natural capital, in ever-closer concert with rational ecosystem management and nature conservation. The symposium will 1) identify gaps in knowledge, 2) find new ways of approaching controversial issues, and 3) define priorities for future research: i.e., seek insight rather than consensus. The envisaged outcome is to catalyze a quantum leap in our understanding of the emerging ""post-normal"" fields of ecological economics and sustainability science that will be collated into a book-a sequel to an earlier book based on a workshop held in 2004 in South Africa to discuss the economics of ecological restoration in developing countries of the South. A Symposium website will be partially open to the public prior to the Symposium and entirely open thereafter. At least one third of Symposium participants will be women, and six graduate students, four from the U.S. and two from Australia, will participate. The Symposium will promote networking and development of collaborative strategies and policies in countries of the North, the South, and internationally."

In addition, deposition of<br/>pollutants associated with PM is a significant input to many ecosystems. For these reasons there is an urgent need for techniques that can measure PM and PM-associated pollutants at short enough time scales that sources of these particles can be characterized and mechanistic models of their chemistry and fate developed. Since these properties are dependent on particle size, the new technique should also be able to separate the PM by size before they are characterized. An additional requirement of these instruments is that they separate particles from the gas stream before collection to avoid sampling artifacts.<br/><br/>An instrument that meets this challenging combination of requirements for near real-time measurement of size-segregated PM without sampling artifacts will be a central outcome of this research. This unique instrument could be used to measure any compound associated with PM that can be converted to the gas phase at temperatures < 850C (for example Hg, organic and elemental carbon, pesticides and numerous other organic compounds) and then detected with a real-time detector (for example cold vapor atomic fluorescence for Hg, or a mass spectrophotometer for pesticides). The instrument will be designed so that different carrier gases can be used to accommodate these different analytical techniques. As a part of this project, we will also develop innovative techniques to evaluate particle samplers in an aerosol wind tunnel.<br/>These techniques will become increasingly important as new particle samplers are developed in response to the growing interest in PM. The proposed development project will be of relevance to the NSF MRI Program by addressing the limitations in current in-situ, size-classified aerosol measurement capabilities and allowing for the development of state-of-the-art instrument for real-time particle characterization."

For example: is the evolution of HIV virulence related <br/>to rates of transmission among hosts? Which environmental factors most <br/>strongly influence the rate of evolution, and what are the strengths <br/>and directions of evolution? This broad class of questions all involve <br/>adaptive evolution (i.e., the direction and strength of natural <br/>selection). All existing methods share the significant shortcoming in <br/>using a completely neutral model of evolution. That is, previous <br/>methods fail to account for natural selection, despite the fact that it <br/>is the central feature of interest. The method developed here is the <br/>most comprehensive to date. It simultaneously accounts for random <br/>evolutionary fluctuations (such as genetic drift), common ancestry, and <br/>natural selection (under multiple adaptive regimes). Methods are <br/>provided for formulating scientific hypotheses as explicit mathematical <br/>models, each of which can then be fit to the data. Modern <br/>model-selection theory is then to identify the best-support model or <br/>models. Because in this approach, the causal factors of interest are <br/>explicitly modeled and tested directly against data, scientists will be <br/>able to use these methods to identify which aspects of the evolutionary <br/>process are most important, describe the relative strengths and <br/>directions of these evolutionary forces, and understand how they have <br/>influenced the tempo and mode of evolution.<br/><br/>The comparative method is a fundamental tool in organismal, <br/>evolutionary and ecological biology. It is used to identify and study <br/>the factors which have been important in producing the diversity of <br/>life we see today. Understanding the significant environmental, <br/>functional, and genetic mechanisms operative in the past is critical <br/>for planning conservation strategies for the future. It is also <br/>important in planning effective strategies to control human disease. <br/>For example, two fronts in the battle against HIV, predicting the <br/>spread of drug-resistance and immune-escape mutations, rely on an <br/>understanding of how HIV evolves in response to natural selection and <br/>how HIV evolution differs within and among hosts. Beyond the <br/>environmental sciences, it is now widely appreciated that studies of <br/>function (at the organismal, biochemical, or gene level) require the <br/>application of the comparative method.The funded research will provide <br/>practical tools to enable comparative biologists to make stronger tests <br/>of their hypotheses."

The MRCF has experienced enor-mous growth in recent years due to increased use of molecular tools by existing faculty and the arrival of six new tenure-track and one research faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences in fall 2004. The acquired instruments will enhance research activities and funding competitive-ness, especially for interdisciplinary collaborative projects. Faculty hires in recent years have been designed to create interactive, interdisciplinary research clusters to plan large-scale pro-jects. Some of these clusters depend upon an efficient, high-capacity MRCF, including evolu-tionary genomics, neurobiology, ""extragenomics"" (studying plasmids & phages), metagenomics (environmental biodiversity assessment and monitoring), and ecological genomics groups. Syn-ergy within these groups, in addition to individual research efforts, is leading to a groundswell of demand for molecular research capacity.<br/><br/>This instrumentation will take the MRCF in two critical new directions. First, in addition to tra-ditional molecular research, many current users are expanding their investigations to genome-scale analyses. Expansion of the MRCF will contribute to its use in small-genome research. The second critical direction for the new instrumentation involves the integration of the MRCF with ISU's existing bioinformatics facilities. This brings the MRCF into the post-genomic era, allow-ing MRCF users to have a seamless experience from job submission to data quality control and storage to manipulation and analysis. The bioinformatics group at ISU has been working with the MRCF since spring 2004 to do the groundwork for this integration and will continue to play a major role in collaborating with the MRCF and its users.<br/><br/>ISU has long emphasized hands-on research opportunities for undergraduate students, many of whom go on to graduate school in the nation's top graduate programs. The MRCF plays a large role in providing facilities for the recruitment and training of regional Hispanic, Native Ameri-can, and rural students by contributing to a ""pipeline to higher education"" focused on bringing molecular science experiences into the classroom and students into research laboratories. Initia-tives include the Native Scholars Program for regional native high school students and the Biol-ogy Youth Research Program for local high school students.

Human spatial behavior, individual and collective, depends on the structure of the environment, the structure and content of cognitive representations of the environment (mental maps), individual and group goals, and interactions among individuals, groups, and crowds. As a result, human spatial behavior needs to be studied by considering all these aspects together; to do this requires a multidisciplinary effort. The proposed research brings together a team of researchers representing diverse disciplines of computation, psychology, and mathematics into an integrated program that will address human individual and collective use of physical space.<br/> This project's multidisciplinary effort uses the tools of cognitive science, computational modeling, and mathematical analysis of collective behavior to study the dynamics of human spatial behavior. The project's goals are as follows: <br/>1) To understand how individuals develop cognitive maps of complex environments in real-world situations that include rich spatial interactions with other people, individually and in groups; <br/>2) To examine how cognitive maps influence the behavior of groups in high-density crowd conditions, and to develop the cognitive foundations for models of pedestrian dynamics and emergency evacuations; <br/>3) To forge a mathematical link between microscopic (small scale) and macroscopic (large scale) models of adaptive human social behavior in spatial tasks. <br/>The research program will develop novel cognitive map-driven models that will include the shared spatial information that individual people derive from social interactions. The models will be used to improve simulations of individuals and crowds, and provide a basis for mathematical analysis of collective spatial behavior dynamics. Validation and evaluation will exploit virtual reality technology, computer simulations of crowd behavior, and people's behavior in real environments. Through partnerships with two museums, the team will be working with real-world situations whose relevance to societal needs includes the design of emergency evacuation systems, automated detection of anomalies in large spaces and crowds, and the development of complex but human-friendly environments. The generation, validation, and free dissemination of powerful predictive models that will be developed will allow architects, planners, and developers of public spaces to design and/or modify public venues so as to optimize their navigability and safety. Finally, a comprehensive program of education, outreach, and dissemination will serve a broad audience of graduate and undergraduate students, inner-city K-12 students and teachers, and the general public will accompany the research."

These systems are naturally nonlinear and<br/>numerical simulation is typically difficult and expensive. The<br/>least-squares finite element method is a powerful tool for many PDE-based<br/>applications in science and engineering. One of the main characteristics<br/>of a least-squares formulation is that it transforms a given set of<br/>equations into a loosely coupled system of scalar equations that can be<br/>treated easily by multilevel finite element methods. The finite element<br/>spaces for the individual unknowns may be chosen independently, based on<br/>simplicity and availability or from the physics of the underlying problem.<br/>The linear systems of equations resulting from well-posed least-squares<br/>discretizations are always self-adjoint and positive definite, and<br/>variational multigrid methods generally provide a robust, scalable solver.<br/>In addition, the associated functional itself provides a natural sharp<br/>local error estimator, which can be used for effective adaptive mesh<br/>refinement. Coupling nested iteration and Newton linearization with a<br/>least-squares discretization and multigrid iterative solver constitutes a<br/>robust, comprehensive solution strategy for difficult nonlinear problems.<br/><br/>This project represents a focused study of least-squares methods for<br/>several linear and nonlinear elasticity and fluid flow problems, extending<br/>to applications in viscoelasticity. Some research in these areas has been<br/>successful and preliminary results are encouraging, but much remains to be<br/>done. This project includes both general solution methodologies for<br/>problems with strong nonlinearities and specific least-squares formulations<br/>for models that have not been analyzed in a least-squares framework. The<br/>applications considered in this project include complex and specialized<br/>systems important in areas including engineering, physics, aerodynamics,<br/>atmospheric sciences, geology, and biomechanics. One target application,<br/>for example, is a specific incompressible, non-Newtonain flow which arises<br/>in the modeling of blood flow. Here, a viscoelastic model that takes into<br/>account the elastic nature of the suspended red blood cells is to be<br/>considered. In these and many other areas of interest, computer simulation<br/>of complex phenomena are currently limited by efficiency of numerical<br/>methods.

However, little is known about how these organizations participate in the larger system of disaster response for the various types of hazards we may face (which range from natural disasters, to terrorist attack, to violent students). In the case of the recent Hurricane Katrina, K-12 schools have been asked to absorb tens of thousands of displaced children. Without the close integration of schools, the network of social services provided to persons displaced by Hurricane Katrina will be incomplete. This study will assess the impact of displaced persons on school districts in Texas as well as analyze the school districts' experiences collaborating with the various deliverers of relief. This research will also gather perishable data on the districts' perceived vulnerability to disaster and the impact of the hurricane on emergency planning processes in school districts. <br/><br/>This study will contribute to scientific knowledge about educational organizations, disaster response, and the role of collaboration on hazard and emergency preparedness in public organizations. There are four likely contributions of this study. First, the study will provide an assessment of the impact of the movement of people displaced by Hurricane Katrina on school districts in Texas. Second, the research will identify the factors most closely related to policy collaboration on the part of K-12 school districts in the response to Hurricane Katrina. Third, the research will contribute to the literature on network policy making and public management. While there is broad consensus that an increasing amount of policy making is occurring in collaborative networks, there is little known about the determinants of highly effective collaboration in disaster response. Fourth, the research will contribute to our understanding of how disasters affect the planning processes initiated in educational organizations. The research will reveal how the disaster in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama has affected the vulnerability assessments of school districts in Texas. These contributions should empower emergency planners in schools (and those who work with schools) to understand how best to coordinate disaster response in a complex network of first responders and relief organizations."

Furthermore, the project provides support for registration of schemes and schemas for use by human and machine agents, as well as support for the machine mapping of relationships among terms and concepts in those schemes (semantic mappings) and schemas (crosswalks). The intellectual merit of the project lies in its use of distributed registries of metadata schemes and schemas to improve services to users in an increasingly heterogeneous Web digital library universe; and it points to an environment where important semantic connections between diverse communities and their vocabularies are effectively enabled. The broader impact of the project is its generalization of registry software and implementation beyond centrally controlled metadata schemas. This enables the distribution of appropriate control and management into the hands of vocabulary creators and maintainers, thus facilitating the potential to overcome economic and legal barriers that have prevented the anticipated growth of registries and distributed registry networks."

Previous stable isotopic reconstructions show that the effects of meltwater discharge in the central Arctic basin were large and sedimentological studies trace two ice rafted debris events from northern Canada to the Fram Strait during the deglacial period. These results imply that changes in Arctic salinity likely played a major role in the variability of North Atlantic overturning circulation. These meltwater events should show up as minima in N. pachyderma d18 O and the magnitude of the anomalies should be proportional to the size of the meltwater event. The cores were collected in 1989 and archived in the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution core repository. They are in excellent condition and remain unsampled. Based on color changes, core sedimentation rates (~1 to 3 cm kyr-1) permit the development of a relatively high-resolution record of deglacial meltwater discharge. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. This research will provide insight into a very important climate question: how sensitive is the Atlantic overturning circulation to reduced salinity in the Arctic Ocean and subpolar North Atlantic? Accurate future projections of climate require this knowledge, yet the best examples of past changes in Atlantic overturning are in the geological record. Atlantic salinity is changing in ways that may affect circulation and heat transport to the North Atlantic: high latitude locations have been freshening for the last forty years in ways never before documented and reduced Greenland Sea convection may already be underway. However, it is difficult to know how much of a salinity change is needed to alter the circulation significantly. Physical oceanographers are unsure and the numerous numerical simulations of future greenhouse climate predict a full range of outcomes from no change in the overturning to a 15 Sv reduction in the Atlantic. To fully understand how sensitive the circulation is to changing salinity requires study of the geological record and specific knowledge of the Arctic Ocean's role in these changes. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Graduate student training is a significant part of this project. Sharon Hoffman, (a second year graduate student) will produce the thorium data for the cores. Additional training will include the research experiences gained by the high school participants who will be involved with sample preparation and analytical procedures for this project.

Recent interviews with magazines (Discover, Newsweek), newspapers (Boston Globe, Wall Street Journal) and radio (local NPR station) attest to the places where the results of this research are likely to be discussed. The Principal Investigator has presented climate briefings and formal testimony to members of the House of Representatives, the Senate, and their staffs in Washington, DC and at Woods Hole."

It faces three challenges: to compile sufficient data, to integrate<br/>multiple databases, and to maintain tools that can assemble all the local data records into a geologic time<br/>line. The third challenge amounts to sequencing the fossil record and we propose to address three of the<br/>obstacles it faces: (1) Fossil biotas of the same age may differ as a result of habitat and preservation<br/>effects; (2) Very large data sets must be sequenced in smaller pieces and the results stitched seamlessly<br/>together; (3) Increasing numbers of dated and fingerprinted ash beds need to used more effectively. We<br/>propose a case study of manageable geographic and temporal extent that, nevertheless, raises these same<br/>issues. The Ordovician and Silurian periods span almost 100 million years of early Paleozoic time and are<br/>traditionally subdivided by graptolites and conodonts - two fossil clades with different ecological and<br/>preservational traits that restrict their use to largely mutually exclusive domains.<br/>The Mohawkian (Late Ordovician) of eastern North America presents precisely the type of<br/>challenging geological environment in which to build and test the temporal sequencing and stitching<br/>approaches that we envision. Mohawkian strata are widely exposed in the region and yield a rich fossil<br/>record that includes diverse, but somewhat endemic, conodont faunas. The epicratonic succession is<br/>rimmed along the Appalachian margin by deeper water sediments of the Taconic foreland basin. These<br/>strata contain a suite of inter-continentally distributed graptolite faunas, but few described conodont<br/>assemblages. Numerous altered volcanic ash deposits (K-bentonites) link these facies through a set of<br/>transitional facies along the interior basin margin. Despite these advantages, the prevalence of short<br/>sections, structural complexity, and facies limitation of the faunas impedes precise and reliable correlation<br/>between the cratonic and basinal successions, consequently limiting our ability to compare their disparate<br/>faunas and tectonic histories.<br/>Intellectual Merit: We propose to combine (1) geochemical fingerprinting (tephrochronology) and<br/>U-Pb geochronology of K-bentonites from the Mohawkian and early Cincinnatian with (2) a restudy of<br/>late Mohawkian conodonts and graptolites from eleven regions across eastern North America and (3)<br/>computer assisted sequencing of the global Ordovician conodont and graptolite fossil record. This work<br/>will provide a detailed temporal and paleoecological framework within which to refine the application of<br/>biofacies information to the temporal sequencing of the fossil record via rigorous quantitative techniques.<br/>We will focus in steps 1 and 2 particularly on conodont and graptolite-bearing successions that contain Kbentonites,<br/>and especially on regions where conodonts and graptolites occur in close association.<br/>The results of our work in a time interval that remains troublesome in spite of a wide range of timestratigraphic<br/>information will bear upon fundamental questions in both local and global stratigraphy. In<br/>the course of this study we will test existing alternate correlation models for the mid Upper Ordovician of<br/>central and eastern North America. The results will provide an improved, age-calibrated basis for studies<br/>of faunal turnover and diversity change in the Ordovician and Silurian. Most importantly, the work will<br/>lead to the development of improved techniques for time scale construction and validation.<br/>Broader Impact: The data and tools we develop will be shared immediately through the CHRONOS<br/>project and will investigate technological solutions that are not being addressed by CHRONOS to<br/>sequence events. The project meets the EARTHTIME goal of cross-training stratigraphers and<br/>geochronologists in developing high precision time-scales.

The FG is an integral part of the plant life cycle and plays critical roles in essentially every step of the angiosperm reproductive process including pollen tube guidance, fertilization, activation of seed development, and maternal control of seed development. Using mRNA-based assays, the proposed research will identify a battery of genes including members of transcription factor gene families expressed in each of the FG cells of Arabidopsis. FG cell-specific patterns of gene expression will be further characterized using promoter:reporter lines. To determine whether any of these genes have functions in FG cell specification or differentiation, corresponding T-DNA mutant lines will be analyzed for defects in FG development and function. To establish the positions of FG transcription-factor genes relative to one another in the gene regulatory circuitry of the FG, altered patterns of promoter:reporter expression will be assayed in the presence of various FG mutations. Finally, to elucidate the gene-regulatory networks operating in these cells, a combination of biochemical, genetic, and molecular biology approaches will be used to establish direct connections between selected transcription-factor genes expressed in specific cells of the FG and their targets. Data from these experiments including the identity of confirmed genes expressed in the FG and all corresponding patterns of expression will be shared with the community at fgproject.biosci.arizona.edu or www.femalegametophyte.org . Research activities will be coordinated through interaction with research groups in the US and abroad with interests in FG development and other aspects of the project. The significance of the proposed work in relation to the overall 2010 Project objectives in determining gene functions is twofold. First, the proposed studies will identify gene expression patterns and any corresponding functions required for plant reproduction. Second, identification of gene-regulatory networks of the FG will contribute to the goal of understanding how gene circuitries control plant processes. Ultimately, results from these studies will be critical for designing strategies to modify reproductive processes in plants for improved seed yield and quality. <br/><br/>The broader educational impacts of this project will enhance the infrastructure of research and training at the Universities of Utah and Arizona through the continued instruction of undergraduate and graduate students, and training of postdoctoral researchers. An important goal of the project is to increase the representation of underrepresented minorities in science and to communicate science through outreach to K-12 teachers and to nonscientists.

The proposal's research objective is to extend the passivity preserving balanced truncation method to account for the statistical variations of system elements. In<br/>an attempt to reduce the error over the frequency range of interest, the PI's earlier work on spectrally-weighted balanced truncation can also be combined with the proposed variational technique to increase the accuracy of the proposed method across the frequency range of interest. The proposed activity will extend the capabilities of the model-order reduction of LTI systems using balanced truncation in several<br/>significant directions, such as guaranteeing passivity and accounting for the statistical variation of the system's elements. Similar to conventional balanced truncation methods, the proposed algorithm provide<br/>a provable error-bound for the reduced-order system. Integrating the proposed variational balanced truncation method with circuit-level simulation algorithms will provide circuit and system designers a<br/>powerful and efficient analytical tool to simulate and optimize large circuits orders of magnitude faster than the Monte-carlo simulation, while retaining the accuracy. The proposed research addresses some of<br/>the fundamental computational approaches in linear system theory with an application in many areas of engineering, particularly electronic design automation. As a consequence, the interdisciplinary research and<br/>education, as well as government and industry, will benefit from the proposed work. The PI's close collaboration with local industry will facilitate the dissemination of research results to U.S. high-tech<br/>companies to contribute to the development of new design tools and methodologies for large statistically-varying linear systems. The capability of simulating large circuits while accounting for the<br/>emerging problem of process variability will make it possible to carry out statistical simulation with far better accuracy, a capability that is currently impossible to achieve. This in turn will have an impact on<br/>future multimedia integrated circuits used in the physical layer of wireless/wireline systems. The proposed educational plan will emphasize the participation of underrepresented groups at the high school,<br/>undergraduate, and graduate levels in the integrated research and training programs in the area of circuit analysis and optimization.

Transcription is the first step in gene expression. During transcription the enzyme RNA polymerase II, using DNA as a template, synthesizes mRNA molecules. The broad goal of this research is to understand in detail the steps that occur during early RNA polymerase II transcription and how they can be controlled. Such an understanding is important because transcription is a principal control point for regulating gene expression during growth, development, and normal cellular metabolism. Specifically, this research will identify which step in RNA synthesis is the slowest and therefore limits the rate at which mRNA is made. In addition, a factor in human nuclei that accelerates the rate of the slow step will be purified, identified, and characterized. This research will also investigate how large complexes containing proteins, DNA, and RNA, which are required for transcription to occur, both assemble and disassemble at genes that are being transcribed. The methods used in these studies center around a well established human transcription system that is assembled in vitro from highly purified proteins. The experiments utilize detailed quantitative assays specifically developed to study the steps of early RNA synthesis and their regulation. This will allow the identification of individual steps that dictate both the level and rate of RNA synthesis. In addition to the above research, an experimental module for an undergraduate biochemistry laboratory will be developed. This module will provide students with experience in designing and implementing a hypothesis driven experiment investigating protein-DNA interactions. Moreover, students will be exposed to state-of-the-art experimental techniques, thereby enhancing the scientific infrastructure of a teaching laboratory course. <br/><br/>This research will impact the understanding of the critical first stages of mRNA transcription by defining where specific steps in the reaction occur and how they are interrelated, the role of the RNA transcript itself in early transcription, and how protein-DNA-RNA complexes assemble and disassemble. Moreover, the experiments will examine unique mechanisms by which transcription can be regulated. The knowledge derived from this research has the potential to stimulate new studies of transcriptional regulation in complex biological systems. In implementing this research, a significant amount of time will be spent training graduate students in experimental design, interpretation of data, creative thought, preparation and writing of manuscripts, and giving formal and informal oral presentations. In addition, developing an experimental module for an undergraduate laboratory underscores the importance of integrating research and education in order to promote teaching, training, and learning."

Simply stated, a BMI uses brain signals to directly control devices such as computers and robots. Today's BMI designs are extremely primitive and are a far cry from the seamless interface between brain and body in animals. In a healthy animal, the brain constantly learns and adapts to the needs of new physical movement, in addition to providing perfectly timed signals to the motor system. In this process, the brain receives and uses sensory feedback to both learn and generate the signals that lead to purposeful motion. In order to inch closer to BMI designs that are of use to humans, better models of brain motor control and movement planning are needed along with the necessary adaptive algorithms and computational architecture needed for their execution in real time. In light of such goals, this project's activities aim to significantly advance the state of the art of BMI research by developing the models, algorithms and computational architecture of dynamically-data-driven BMIs (DDDBMIs) that implement recently proposed advanced brain models of motor control. Achieving this goal in the proposed approaches will also allow to address a chief problem in current BMI research: The fact that paraplegics cannot train their own network models because they cannot move their limbs.<br/><br/>The research on DDDBMI systems conducted under this project is a drastic departure of the conventional BMI paradigm. The control interface architecture is distributed and borrowed from recent models of neurophysiology of movement, which will enable better overall performance. Learning occurs simultaneously for the subject and the control models in a synergistic manner, which requires more powerful adaptation schemes. Selective use of many computational models is the reason why a dynamically data-driven system is needed to provide the computational needs of a DDDBMI. The project interdisciplinary activities are closely intertwined around the development and integration of the DDDBMI components into a platform for BMI research. Research on middleware addresses the need for dynamic aggregation of Grid-resources with Quality-of-Service guarantees, and support for dynamic computation steering. Research on adaptive algorithms focuses on new data models and learning algorithms. Research on brain modeling concentrates on cognitive models of motor control and advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of movement. In the long run, the BMI experimental research platform will have a dual role: it will help validate the brain models under investigation and it will provide insights on to how to design BMIs for use by paraplegic patients."

Electron microscopy has become a vital tool for characterizing a wide array of nano-materials, including catalysts, carbon and inorganic nanotubes, self-assembled nano-materials, and electronic nano-components. Recent advances in instrumentation and sampling techniques, however, are now promising to create a dramatic revolution in the ability to use electron microscopy under dynamic in situ conditions (elevated temperatures, pressures, reactive flows, etc. with time resolution) which are key to the successful application of a new generation of active nanostructures and devices. The opportunities that will be presented in the workshop are unprecedented for developing a more fundamental understanding of the dynamics of nano-synthesis processes, reactive nano-structures, functional nano-materials, and evolving nano-components. The discussions will offer valuable insights into the practical challenges associated with experimental techniques as well as providing an exposure to theoretical approaches that can be used in the interpretation of dynamic electron microscopy data. The major outcome of the current workshop will be a NSF workshop report that will chart the direction of dynamic in situ electron microscopy research, especially in the area of nanotechnology.<br/>The broader impact of the workshop will be highly significant, since at least 30 of the leading researchers (nearly all active US researchers) and approximately 15 graduate and post-graduate students will attend. Prominent invited speakers will address the key experimental and theoretical aspects of dynamic electron microscopy. In addition to the NSF workshop report, which will be distributed after the meeting, a special issue of an archival journal will be published, and a workshop web site will be established. The workshop will also include international representatives so that a worldwide benchmarking of US efforts will be obtained. The combination of leading academic researchers and advanced instrumentation developers will likely have a significant impact on the design of new electron microscopy equipment. The organizer has a strong record of involving students from underrepresented groups in prior NSF awards, and she has made a strong commitment to involving minorities and women in this workshop."

Once this problem is under control attention must be turned to the removal of vast quantities of soil and sediment deposited within urban areas such as New Orleans. An urgent question to be answered is whether this material does or does not contain chemical contaminants at levels of concern. The answer to this question will define how and where the material can be disposed, what degree of personal protection gear must be worn by workers removing this material, and if any further environmental concerns will be posed by this material after removal.<br/>There are two questions that must be answered in order to move forward with soil and sediment removal. First of all, is the material considered hazardous waste and must therefore be disposed of in special landfills? And second question is, does the material pose a toxicity risk to humans and/or the environment? Both of these questions must be answered in a matter of weeks. This urgency poses a challenge to some of the conventional means of addressing these questions. Clearly new assessment approaches are needed in this case. We are proposing to answer each of these two questions through the application and validation of new techniques that we have been developing, generally in the context of mine site evaluations.<br/>We will apply to these samples an acidic solution (acetic acid) designed to leach contaminants from the solids under conditions that simulate a landfill. This field-based test will be developed and calibrated by comparison to standard TCLP tests. The measurements will focus on toxic metals (Pb, As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, etc.) with an emphasis on lead and arsenic. In this way we will determine if a need for specialized disposal of these materials exists. The goal here is to make a field-portable method that approximates the results of the slower and more laborious EPA-approved TCLP test."

They form complex communities that respond to natural changes in the ecosystem at a variety of time and space scales. Despite decades of study, however, the current understanding of their regulation in natural systems and ability to predict their population dynamics remain inadequate. The principal impediments to improving this situation have been (1) the inability to sample adequately at the appropriate space and time scales and (2) the difficulty of deriving population-dynamic parameters (such as population growth rate) from the data that can be collected. In an attempt to overcome the first impediment, new sensor technologies for autonomous, in situ measurement of critical information about natural phytoplankton assemblages have been recently developed. To overcome the second impediment, a significant interdisciplinary collaboration, between mathematical scientists and biological oceanographers, is required. The PIs on this project will establish just such a collaboration.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The investigators-an applied mathematician, a statistician, and two biological oceanographers-will collaborate closely to develop a series of mathematical models for phytoplankton cell growth and division that reflect effects of changes in environmental conditions. The models will be validated by controlled growth experiments in the laboratory, with mono-specific phytoplankton cultures, that specify how diel patterns in population structure respond to changes in growth conditions (light, temperature, and nutrients). Rigorous statistical procedures will be developed to a) guide model refinement and evaluate model performance against results from laboratory cultures and b) estimate model parameters in order to predict population growth rates. The project will provide fundamental insights into the regulation of coastal ocean ecosystems.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: Beyond the inherent societal relevance, the proposed activities will have broader impacts within the scientific community. A new generation of coastal observatories, with the capability to generate long time-series similar to those that we propose to analyze, will soon be operational. By making the statistical model (and any software developed to run it) available to the oceanographic community, the investigators will contribute to broad and innovative ecological applications of ocean observatories and the data they generate. In addition, the research results will be integrated with teaching and other forms of education at several levels from the general public to graduate students. The combination of coastal sciences and innovative technologies that this proposed research involves will provide a compelling context for informal education efforts through public exhibits."

The investigators hypothesize that customization of resources will result in visitors spending more time in NSDL and students achieving more in-depth learning.<br/><br/>As a testbed, the investigators are creating a customized learning environment, ""Customized MathForum,"" within the Math Forum Digital Library (MFDL; http://mathforum.org), which is one of the most popular instructional digital libraries and has one of the largest communities of users (over a million individuals). The investigators are indexing the digital library according to cognitive, affective, and social dimensions and are evaluating whether such indexing helps stakeholders (teachers, students, and contributors/authors) find effective and efficient material and whether such indexing results in more effective learning than when resources are chosen randomly. Project activities include:<br/><br/>* designing a customized learning environment for middle school and high school teachers and students within MFDL;<br/>* generating a portal to a special library of 750 arithmetic and geometry problems individualized for specific cognitive and behavioral skills;<br/>* developing smart search tools and intelligent agents that will search the digital library for appropriate resources;<br/>* integrating an enhanced metadata system in MFDL along dimensions that are important to teachers and learners--e.g., relation to state educational standards, and cognitive, affective, and social characteristics;<br/>* evaluating the impact of providing customized problems for students and teachers; and<br/>* disseminating tools for customized services to other digital library service providers.<br/><br/>Though described in terms of MFDL, this research is general and the methodology is applicable to many NSDL collections.<br/><br/>This project builds on tools and technologies that have evolved from several NSF-supported projects in three domains: intelligent tutoring systems, digital libraries, and instructional networks.

Exploiting these functions for applications that could benefit society is limited by various factors, such as the marginal kinetic stability of proteins, which makes them susceptible to degradation. The term ""kinetic stability"" is used to describe the property of proteins whose structures are trapped in their functional state, and are therefore resistant to degradation. Few proteins in nature are kinetically stable, and unfortunately the chemical and physical basis for this property is poorly understood. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the structural basis of kinetic stability. The project involves the development of a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis assay for the high-throughput detection and quantification of kinetic stability. This novel assay will be used to screen the proteins expressed by various microorganisms and should result in the identification of many kinetically stable proteins. Those proteins emerging from the assay whose three-dimensional structures are known will be used to create a database that will be analyzed using computational approaches to elucidate the structural basis of kinetic stability. An expected outcome of the computational analysis is the generation of an algorithm that can predict whether a protein of known three-dimensional structure possesses kinetic stability. Thus, by revealing how nature has endowed some proteins with high kinetic stability without compromising their function, this project may have a broad impact on society by enabling the rational engineering of proteins. If successful, the knowledge obtained through this project could be applied to improve and expand the use of proteins in many applications, including biomaterials, biosensors, and bioremediation.<br/><br/>Broader impact: This project will have an impact on our educational infrastructure by providing training and mentoring to graduate and undergraduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities. Students will work together in an intellectually stimulating environment that integrates mentoring, research training, and learning. Learning through hands-on research is the most effective method for exposing students to science and its career opportunities. Students will work in independent but related research projects that require their frequent interaction and collaboration, and weekly group meetings will provide them a forum to present their research to the other members of the laboratory. Yearly participation at local or national meetings will give students an opportunity to disseminate their results through poster presentations, and will expose them to the broader scientific community and new areas of research."

The answer to this question is fundamental to the understanding of how cells form specialized plasma membrane domains during growth and differentiation. In eukaryotic cells, secretory vesicles bud from the trans Golgi network (TGN) and are transported along cytoskeletal tracks to the vicinity of their site of fusion with the plasma membrane. The links between vesicle transport, targeting and fusion are just now beginning to be understood. This research will examine the role of Exo70p in these processes. Exo70p is the 70 kilodalton protein component of the yeast exocyst complex that is required for vesicle docking and fusion at sites of polarized growth. This complex contains at least 8 protein components, but little is known about their biochemical function. To gain a greater understanding of the mechanism of secretory vesicle targeting and fusion, the investigators will examine:<br/>1)How Exo70 regulates the specificity of secretory vesicle targeting.<br/>2)How Exo70 links vesicle targeting to the fusion machinery.<br/>The research combines the strengths of yeast genetics with biochemical and cell biological approaches. Genetic screens will be used to identify proteins that are required for secretory vesicle transport and for the specificity of vesicle targeting in an exo70-38 mutant. This project will explore the innovative idea that secretory vesicle transport and recognition may be directly coupled to vesicle fusion by Exo70p. Towards this end the project will determine whether an exocyst component protein can regulate the specificity of secretory vesicle docking. The expectations are that the project will provide new insights into how Exo70p links vesicle transport to vesicle docking, recognition and fusion at the plasma membrane. This will be accomplished by investigating the role of Exo70p in t-SNARE clustering at the site of fusion and how different classes of secretory vesicles can be discriminated during vesicle targeting/docking to the plasma membrane. In polarized epithelium, the exocyst complex is required for basolateral vesicle targeting and the exocyst is localized to the sites of polarized growth (growth cones) in developing neurons.

At such distances there can be significant effects on the structure and dynamics of liquids. The materials are highly porous, of optical quality, and the average pore size and chemical nature of the pore surfaces can be controlled readily. The experiments are based on the use of ultrafast optical Kerr effect (OKE) techniques. The role of molecular shapes on the dynamics of weakly wetting liquids at solid/liquid interfaces will be investigated as function of temperature and pore size.<br/><br/>There are several ways in which this research will make an impact. Confined liquids are found throughout nature and are also important in many areas of technology. The knowledge gained from this work will be of importance to many areas of science and technology, such as, for example, how water behaves in biological contexts, while the work on the confined alkanes will have direct bearing on lubrication and oil recovery. The university and high school students, as well as high school teachers who will participate in this project will be involved in a multidisciplinary undertaking that broadens their outlook and understanding of how contemporary science is practiced."

It drives processes across scales from the smallest to the largest: protein subunits assemble into fibers, embryonic cells assemble into organ primordia, organ primordia assemble into tissues and organs. Biological self-assembly is under genetic control, but genes do not create shape and do not move matter around: physical mechanisms do. This cross-disciplinary project is aimed at discovering principles of self-assembly at the multicellular level by dissecting the interplay between molecular and biophysical factors driving the organization of cells and tissues into organs, and employing the garnered knowledge to direct the formation of organ modules: functional three-dimensional living structures of specific shape. The discovered principles of multicellular organization will serve as the basis for the construction of functional modules by ""bioprinting"": the biologically compatible delivery of living cells or their aggregates as ""bioink"" particles into the ""scaffold-biopaper."" The products of the project will be generalizable principles of multicellular self-assembly and functional three-dimensional biological structures.<br/> The outlined program will integrate basic sciences with engineering, modeling with experiments and research with education. Students involved in this project will go through training that will prepare them for the multiple challenges facing researchers in the life sciences entering today's job market. In particular, they will become ""multilingual"": able to communicate and collaborate with experts in several scientific disciplines. The successful completion of this project will contribute to our knowledge of biological organization in general, and our ability to guide and thus employ these processes so as to develop functional biological structures for basic science purposes. The principles of self-assembly illuminated through this project will provide a foundation on which other research canbe conducted into possibilities for future organ building and replacement. Through interactive exhibits, it will also help the public understand the process of science and what scientists do, especially as part of an integrated multidisciplinary team trying to tackle a problem of broad interest."

They provide the food that we eat, absorb CO2, put oxygen in the air, provide wood, fiber, and were the original source of most coal. This project will explore the fundamental, shared properties of land plants by studying the genomes of the closest living relatives of land plants. The charophyte green algae are structurally simple organisms that share relatively recent ancestry with plants, and consequently understanding these organisms can help understand the properties of the ancestors of plants. Seven charophytes will be studied by EST analysis, with a goal of obtaining roughly 10,000 individual EST sequences from each of these seven organisms. EST analysis involves sequencing randomly-selected clones from a library made of reverse-transcribed messenger RNA, and is complementary to complete-genome sequencing. In addition to EST sequencing, the project will fully sequence a substantial fraction of the clones, will annotate and analyze the sequences for their potential significance to the evolution of land plants, and will perform preliminary studies such as genome size estimation that will provide background information needed for future genomic study.<br/><br/>This project will greatly expand the database of gene sequences available from the closest living relatives of land plants. This will lead to an improved understanding of the fundamental properties of land plants and their relatives. In addition, it will provide comparative data that are essential for more applied studies that seek to control and manipulate plant properties such as signal transduction - which controls plant development and environmental responses - key biochemistries such as lignification and secondary-products chemistry, and crop yield and environmental tolerance. The work will be coordinate with, and will complement, ongoing efforts to understand plant and microbial genomes, and the structure of the tree of life, and will lead toward the development of novel model systems. It will provide training for at least one postdoctoral associate and several undergraduates."

Many of the clinically accepted anticancer drugs have side effect problems because of the dosages that must be used to overcome low solubility and bioavailability properties. A new delivery vehicle has been developed, which, when attached to known chemotherapeutic agents , increases water solubility and improves the drugs anticancer activity in in-vitro tests. The Phase II goals are to evaluate further enhancement of solubility with modified delivery segments, do in-vivo evaluations in mice with human tumor xenografts, and to do pharmacokinetic studies of the drugs in the rat model.<br/><br/>The commercial application of this technology is in cancer chemotherapy. Increased solubility and bioavailability should reduce the quantity and side effects of the expensive drugs that are currently used. Furthermore, certain drugs that could not be used previously because of poor cellular uptake, might now be made available using this mode of delivery."

This is especially true for transaction oriented consumer service businesses such as retail banking, brokerage, package transport, and retail trade in which consumers can have frequent and multiple points of contact with an organization. One significant service innovation over the last decade is the use of information technology to support customer self-service. A well designed multi-channel service delivery system, including both customer-provided self-service and employee-provided full-service, can simultaneously lower costs and improve service quality, as well as create related benefits such as increased customer retention. The profound impact of this proliferation of self-service is evident in the strong growth of the so-called ""self-service economy"" that involves almost all major service industries as well as the service operations of manufacturers.<br/><br/>While offering multiple service channels is generally viewed as a competitive necessity in many industries, there is a considerable amount of discretion on the design and management of self-service channels. Our research will specifically focus on the role of the customer in service co-production, drawing on customer efficiency. Efficient customers are able to co-produce required services at a low cost and therefore will tend to disproportionately utilize self-service channels when it is feasible for a given service need. Therefore, it has become important to measure and improve customer efficiency for successful service delivery that features technology-enabled self-service. <br/><br/>We investigate a series of issues in regard to the design and management of a multi-channel service delivery system featuring self-service technology in the retail banking industry, an industry at the forefront of this transformation. Through alliances forged with industry participants, we have access to data of unprecedented scale and scope on customer utilization of banking service channels and active participation of senior management at our partner institutions to maximize the contribution to industry practice. The expected insights from this work can be readily extended to other service industries as well as government institutions, service and support operations in manufacturing firms, and non-commercial organizations seeking to improve their service operations by offering self-service."

TFs are key switches that control plant defense responses against pathogens, and expression profiling using Gene Chips (microarrays) is the most powerful genomics approach available for high through-put analysis of transcriptional events. Profiling will identify candidate TFs in understudied defense pathways, including those induced by so-called ""PAMP"" molecules that are commonly associated with pathogens of plants as well as animals. We will evaluate the TF mutants for their impact on disease resistance to find whether disrupting the genes and their functions will affect any defense response. The TFs identified in this way will be linked to green fluorescent protein to mark and sort the cells expressing the TF genes . Transcriptional profiling will be conducted in these cells to identify genes whose expression patterns mirror those of the TFs (i.e., cohort transcriptomes). The TFs will also be modified so their transport into the nucleus, where they function, can be controlled experimentally and their target genes will be identified. Collectively, these experiments will provide the spatial, temporal, and hierarchical information about defense-related transcriptional events which is currently lacking, but needed to build a model of the transcriptional network of interacting defense pathways. Data obtained in this project will be deposited in IMDS (integrated microarray data system) (http://ausubellab.mgh.harvard.edu/imds) and made available to the public in a timely manner. IMDS is a public web-accessible microarray database created by this project to facilitate storage, retrieval and analysis of microarray data sets. It stores experimental descriptions, raw microarray data and sets of normalized data. The data in IMDS will be maintained beyond the lifetime of the 2010 award by exporting it to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and the Arabidopsis Information Resource. The significance of this multi-investigator effort to the overall 2010 project objectives is several-fold. Defense responses in plants involve global changes in gene expression (>10% of the genome). Therefore, identifying TFs holds the key for understanding the mechanism of defense. Also, an in-depth analysis of large gene sets requires the efforts of several laboratories and coordination afforded by this project avoids duplication of efforts and cuts costs. Finally, each new profiling experiment added to IMDS will enhance the ability of researchers in the scientific community to design experiments that will further elucidate key features of the plant defense response. This project provides a training environment for undergraduates, doctoral students, and postdocs. Participants will learn not only classical genetic and phytopathology methods, but also cutting-edge genomics and bioinformatics technologies. A key training component is the project's annual workshop, where students and postdocs present their research in a semi-formal setting. Undergraduate training in genomics and bioinformatics is also a significant aspect of this project."

Both legal pundits and social scientists predict that the consequence of this new style of judicial campaigning will be the loss of legitimacy for state legal systems and courts; as citizens come to see courts as not unique -- that is, as ordinary political institutions -- the impartiality of the courts will be questioned, undermining the basic legitimacy of these institutions. These new-style judicial campaigns thus provide a propitious context for further development of theories of judicial legitimacy in the laboratories of the American states. Specifically, this project will test the hypothesis that the politicized character of judicial campaigning influences perceptions of the legitimacy of law and courts. Using a three-wave panel survey of a representative sample of citizens in the state of Texas, the research will examine whether changes in attitudes toward law and courts are a function of exposure to politicized judicial campaign advertisements. The project takes advantage of the relatively new databases of actual campaign ads, which allow the researchers to know the nature of the advertising content to which voters are exposed. Beyond the project's contributions to research infrastructure and graduate student training, the project will make the data collected available to the scholarly community with very little embargo period. In addition, the project will yield much-needed empirical evidence on the consequences of electing judges in the contemporary political environment."

Students who complete this laboratory-intensive, three semester sequence are well prepared to participate in interdisciplinary research. Indeed, the second major initiative of this program is to extend opportunities for first- and second-year students to participate in interdisciplinary research projects. The expanded undergraduate research program includes opportunities for students to become involved in research while studying abroad at selected sites, such as a tropical field station in Costa Rica. These activities form the centerpiece of a renewed effort to recruit students to science majors. Not only does the integrated course sequence present a challenging and forward-looking introduction to the natural sciences, but the accelerated program gives students more flexibility in their undergraduate curriculum. These features encourage entering students to study science even as they help improve retention of science majors. The major intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the development of the integrated introductory course sequence. Reflecting current opinion about how to improve undergraduate science teaching, this course sequence features an interdisciplinary treatment of biology, chemistry, and physics and investigative laboratory work. The case study approach provides the framework for substantive interaction of the three disciplines while providing students with a structure within which they can understand and relate diverse abstract concepts. The new integrated introductory course is taught in parallel with the current introductory courses in biology, chemistry, and physics allowing detailed evaluation of the new approach in comparison to a more traditional approach. This project has a broader impact in several respects. Dissemination includes formation of a library of case studies that are being made available to others who are interested in adapting this approach at their institutions. Also, the results of a program assessment based on direct comparison of two methods of teaching introductory science to undergraduates will contribute useful information to current debates about improving undergraduate science education. The educational experience of the classroom and teaching laboratory are connected with the research laboratory by linking the integrated introductory course with new opportunities for undergraduate research. The participation of women in science is enhanced because one of the participating colleges, Scripps College (the women's college in the Claremont consortium), promotes science education and research as key contributors to the implementation of its mission. Finally, by promoting an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to undergraduate science education, this program is preparing students to work at the interface of traditional scientific disciplines where many of the future problems in science are likely to reside."

The bridge system consists of glass fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite deck and precast/prestressed concrete I-girders. The primary objectives are: (1) understanding the synergistic effects of low temperature and low-temperature thermal cycling combined with fatigue loading on the performance of FRP composite bridge decks in cold regions, and (2) quantifying the horizontal shear stiffness of typical deck-to-girder connection systems and developing the connection design criteria based on the shear stiffness rating of the connection.<br/><br/>One of the technical barrier to the use of composite materials in infrastructure applications is lack of data on environmental durability specific to typical infrastructure environments and for the types of composite materials that are likely to be deployed in the infrastructure. This project could potentially provide a basis for making long-term predictions about FRP composite material properties behavior under cold environmental conditions.<br/>The basic knowledge obtained is likely to be of long-lasting value. It can especially advance the knowledge base for application of structural materials, including effects derived from interaction with a natural environment. By using the appropriate materials and structural forms, the research will ultimately extend beyond Alaska and will benefit other regions.<br/>This project will enhance graduate student education through curriculum development and give undergraduate students an opportunity for research experience in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) by involving them in the research project. Another objective of the educational program is to involve K-12 students through UAF Alaska Summer Research Academy. These students will be exposed to structural engineering, and especially women and minority students in high schools will be mentored to encourage careers in structural engineering and to improve enrollment of traditionally underrepresented groups in engineering fields. With enrollments down and retirements up, what will our future engineering look like? A key part of the answer lies in the underrepresented majority, as pointed out in the recent ASEE 2003 Annual Conference & Exposition. This project also involves the development of a seminar series accessible through the World Wide Web (WWW) for remotely located professional engineers in the area of structural composite and precast concrete as alternative construction materials, which can extend the construction season in Alaska.<br/>This research will improve engineering research, education, and, ultimately, the engineer resource pool in cold regions. This project is congruent with the mission of UAF in that it will advance knowledge of natural and technological systems and include a northern perspective on research and education. The PI is a member of the engineering faculty at an EPSCoR institution, and this project will support the development of advanced material testing facilities at UAF, thus enhancing our infrastructure for future research and education goals."

This is especially true for transaction oriented consumer service businesses such as retail banking, brokerage, package transport, and retail trade in which consumers can have frequent and multiple points of contact with an organization. One significant service innovation over the last decade is the use of information technology to support customer self-service. A well designed multi-channel service delivery system, including both customer-provided self-service and employee-provided full-service, can simultaneously lower costs and improve service quality, as well as create related benefits such as increased customer retention. The profound impact of this proliferation of self-service is evident in the strong growth of the so-called ""self-service economy"" that involves almost all major service industries as well as the service operations of manufacturers.<br/><br/>While offering multiple service channels is generally viewed as a competitive necessity in many industries, there is a considerable amount of discretion on the design and management of self-service channels. Our research will specifically focus on the role of the customer in service co-production, drawing on customer efficiency. Efficient customers are able to co-produce required services at a low cost and therefore will tend to disproportionately utilize self-service channels when it is feasible for a given service need. Therefore, it has become important to measure and improve customer efficiency for successful service delivery that features technology-enabled self-service. <br/><br/>We investigate a series of issues in regard to the design and management of a multi-channel service delivery system featuring self-service technology in the retail banking industry, an industry at the forefront of this transformation. Through alliances forged with industry participants, we have access to data of unprecedented scale and scope on customer utilization of banking service channels and active participation of senior management at our partner institutions to maximize the contribution to industry practice. The expected insights from this work can be readily extended to other service industries as well as government institutions, service and support operations in manufacturing firms, and non-commercial organizations seeking to improve their service operations by offering self-service."

Examples of such networks include survivable next-generation optical wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) backbone networks that can (1) accommodate connections of diverse bandwidth granularities and diverse path lengths in case of multi-path provisioning, and (2) protect against multiple network failures, including network-area disasters. <br/><br/>Intellectual Impact: The project has three major research components, as outlined below.<br/><br/>First, the project will study the problem of differentiated protection services in mesh networks. Noting that different connections may have different service-level agreements (SLAs) on their availabilities, the objective is to select a proper protection mechanism (e.g., dedicated or shared or no protection at all) to cost-effectively provision a connection request to meet its SLA.<br/><br/>Second, the project will investigate survivable multi-path provisioning. Specifically, new protection and provisioning strategies will be designed to exploit emerging inverse-multiplexing technologies in networks such as Next-Generation SONET/SDH. By splitting up and provisioning a connection over multiple paths through inverse multiplexing, one can achieve degraded service even in case of (multiple) failures (vs. no service at all as in present mode of operation of networks).<br/><br/>Third, the project will investigate the problem of reprovisioning protection bandwidth. In particular, the investigators will study backup reprovisioning to handle multiple concurrent failures, which means that a new failure occurs before a previous failure is repaired. Such backup reprovisioning strategies can lead to more efficient use of the bandwidth resources that are needed to protect against network failures.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The approaches and results of this project can have much broader applicability, e.g., bandwidth provisioning in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and other networks. Besides enhancing the national educational infrastructure through student training, this project is expected to have a strong influence on the telecom industry, with which the PIs have a close working relationship. Thus, research results from this project can help to improve the robustness of the national (and global) communication infrastructure, with all the attendant benefits."

While much attention has been directed towards correlating present species distribution with annual ice conditions, no study has yet focused on the micro-evolution of marine fauna in the polar regions as a function of annual sea ice dynamics. This study aims specifically at testing the hypothesis that annual sea ice conditions have significant micro-evolutionary effects in ringed seal (Phoca hispida), a phagophilic species that is highly dependant on specific annual sea ice and snow dynamics. The genotype at 96 nuclear SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) loci and the nucleotide sequence of the maternally inherited mitochondrial control region will be determined in 1,379 ringed seal samples collected in areas around Greenland where annual sea ice regimes are highly heterogeneous in space and time. The proposed study is unique by specifically focusing on the interaction between a dynamic physical feature of the Polar environment and the micro-evolution of a polar fauna. An understanding of such micro-evolutionary effects of sea ice conditions on polar fauna is important in terms of enhancing our predictive capabilities regarding the long-term effects of climate change in polar regions. The ringed seal is centrally placed in the Arctic food web and any processes that affect ringed seals cannot be viewed in isolation, but are likely to extend to other species to which the ringed seal is ecologically linked. The proposed high-resolution population genetic approach taken is novel and unprecedented in a study aimed at natural populations of a non-model species. The study extends the application of genetic analyses to a detailed tempo-spatial scale where current and traditional approaches so far mostly have proven insufficient. The comprehensive collection of samples available for other marine species provides a unique opportunity to later extend the proposed study above from single-species to a comprehensive ecosystem level analysis. The results of the proposed study will have relevance in terms of formulating management policies for ringed seals and those species that are part of the same food web. Ringed seals are harvested for local subsistence in many areas in the Arctic and understanding the processes that limit or facilitates dispersal is central in defining sound management policies. The proposed study enhances international research by international collaboration between a US education and research institution and a Danish governmental research institution. The project involves training of a postdoctoral researcher in state-of-the-art genetic analyses of natural populations, and will serve as an example of the application of high-throughput SNP genotyping in the study of natural populations, where this approach yet has to take footing. In addition to publication of the results in scientific journals, and the establishment of a dedicated web site to present the data and results, a poster for wide distribution will be published in Greenlandic and Danish presenting the findings of the study in layman's terms. The aim of the poster is to relay the concept of the high degree of connectivity among distant geographic locations as well as the long-term influence of sea ice upon Arctic fauna. The proposed work builds upon and extends the principal investigator's current research program which focus on population structure and connectivity in natural animal populations, in particularly marine mammals."

The key factor inhibiting deeper understanding of theoretical advances concerning the nature and effects of HRPs is the extraordinary difficulty in obtaining appropriate data. By generating the right data and applying appropriate econometric methods, this project will contribute important findings and new data of interest to many researchers including economists in the fields of insider econometrics and personnel economics. By using large and rich data sets both for workers who remained in as well as those who left the firm during the study period, this project is able to employ unusual controls and to use appropriate econometric methods to deal with problems that often plague empirical work in this area, such as selectivity issues. Furthermore, in some instances, this project's approach may best be characterized as representing a quasi experiment. Having access to census data in some countries will enable the investigators to generalize their findings. <br/><br/>Already senior management in 10 firms in the U.S., Finland and China are providing the investigators with three types of extraordinary micro-data. Performance data sets usually include daily or weekly performance measures for individual workers and key organizational units (e.g. teams), cover extended periods (more than 3 years), contain multiple measures of performance (including productivity and quality), span the times both before and after major organizational innovations (such as the introduction of teams) and include all employees of the firm during the study period. Personnel data sets contain detailed individual employee records, including longitudinal disaggregated information by type of compensation. Employee survey data sets provide supplementary information both on employees' participation in HRPs and attitudinal and perceptual measures that are constructed to gauge both employee outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction and intensity of effort) and theoretical concepts, including proxies for the extent of peer pressure, discretionary effort, the extent of attention to quality, and communications. Most unusually, in some cases employee surveys will be panels-having been administered more than once to the same employees and for a period both before and after all employees were covered by a particular HRP.<br/><br/>In a series of ""econometric case studies"" these matching data will be used to test hypotheses on four sets of issues concerning the nature, determinants and effects of HRPs. The key focus is on the impact of different HRPs on business performance---especially high performance workplace practices (HPWPs, e.g. employee ownership, teams and profit sharing). Competing hypotheses on whether individual HPWPs improve levels and variability of enterprise performance and whether sets of HPWPs produce improvements in enterprise performance that exceed the effect of individual organizational changes are examined. The second set of hypotheses concern competing hypotheses as to whether individual HRPs improve employee outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction and work intensity) and whether sets of HRPs are associated with changes in employee outcomes that exceed the effect of individual organizational changes. The third set of hypotheses concern the actual channels through which firm and employee outcomes might be affected by the introduction of HRPs. Thus, financial participation (e.g. profit sharing) may lead employees to increase their co-workers performance either by enhanced peer pressure or through greater trust leading to improved cooperation. These influences may work in different directions. Also our data enable this project to study the incidence of certain HRPs within firms (e.g. what accounts for differences in individual shareholdings in firms that have employee ownership?) Finally, in all three areas the project will investigate hypotheses that exploit the uniform nature of data for cases located in very different environments. Thus the project provides evidence on hypotheses concerning predicted differences in the size of both firm and employee outcomes in differing institutional environments (such as the U.S. compared to Finland or China).<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Since HRPs are assuming increasing importance, the project findings are apt to have broad implications for organizational design. Particularly novel will be evidence on offline teams and individual ownership, for outcomes including product quality and matching evidence on employee outcomes. Comparative evidence will provide useful insights concerning the potentially varying impact of HRPs across countries and sectors and hence indications as to how transferable HRPs are across diverse nations. These insights are particularly useful since the number of foreign transplants in China and other transition economies is expected to continue to rise. Finally, theoretical work concerning the nature and effects of organizational innovations is likely to benefit from our subjecting diverse hypotheses to rigorous empirical scrutiny."

Although there exist proposed solutions of idealized (and unrealistic) spin glass models, the principal investigators' interests center on answering fundamental statistical mechanical questions that bear on the behavior of real laboratory spin glasses. These questions, many of which remain controversial despite two decades of intensive study, include the nature of ordering in the equilibrium spin glass phase, understanding anomalous behavior, such as slow relaxation and aging arising from nonequilibrium dynamics, and proving the presence or absence of a phase transition in finite dimensions. The methods used and concepts introduced should be relevant not only for spin glasses but also for other disordered systems, many of which remain poorly understood. Moreover, the generality of the principal investigators' approach to dynamics should yield progress in certain aspects of nonequilibrium dynamics in both homogeneous and disordered systems.<br/><br/>Our deep physical and mathematical understanding of ordered systems in the solid and liquid state --- for example, crystals, ferromagnets, superconductors, liquid crystals, and many others --- has been both of fundamental scientific importance and has spurred profound technological change throughout the second half of the last century. However, there exist many systems, both familiar and unfamiliar, in which randomness or disorder plays a key role, and in which our mathematical and physical understanding remains comparatively primitive. One familiar example is ordinary window glass, where the atoms or molecules are ""stuck"" in random locations (as opposed to a regular crystalline array as would be found, for example, in ice). Spin glasses are disordered magnetic systems which are thought to be prototypes for this kind of macroscopic ""frozen-in"" disorder. Disordered systems in general present both fundamental scientific challenges and at the same time hold great promise for applications. The latter includes not only the possibility of new materials and devices but also the creation of new algorithms and applications to the biological and other sciences. Progress in understanding these systems is therefore greatly desirable. Spin glasses may be more amenable to mathematical analysis than other materials in this class. Nevertheless, little fundamental progress has been made even here. The principal investigators' work is aimed at resolving basic mathematical and physical issues concerning these materials and at providing a general theoretical approach for a wide variety of disordered systems."

The goal of this project is to examine the role of this mechanism in the acclimation of photosynthetic carbon fixation in marine diatoms to low CO2, and the modulation of this acclimation by light and nutrient limitation. Laboratory experiments will focus on quantifying C4 gene transcript abundances and enzyme activities in short-term experiments and in light-dark cycle and light- and nitrogen-limited cultures of model diatom species. Fieldwork will focus on examining the importance of the C4 concentrating mechanism and its regulation by CO2 in an upwelling region off the coast of Oregon characterized by a naturally wide range of CO2 concentrations. The field experimental approach will be to measure the sensitivities of photosynthetic carbon fixation in natural diatom populations to the inhibition of C4 enzymes, in relation to in situ and manipulated concentrations of CO2. The regulation of carbon fixation in marine diatoms by carbon dioxide (CO2) and the modulation of CO2 control by light and nutrients may affect ocean productivity, biological carbon export from surface waters and therefore the contribution of diatoms to global carbon cycling, and phytoplankton species composition. The results of this research will be of interest to oceanographers studying the controls of primary production and the biological carbon pump, geochemists interested in the use of stable carbon isotopes in diatom organic matter to understand current and historic productivity and climate change, and marine ecologists interested in the structure and evolution of phytoplankton communities. The project will support and train a graduate student as well as provide research opportunities for undergraduates. The researchers will also incorporate undergraduate students from the NSF-funded RIOS summer internship program into this project and will support the public outreach and education efforts of the newly established Mid-Atlantic Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence."

Most studies of nutrient transport have focused on single components of the watershed such as a stream or lake, but little is know about how combinations of streams and lakes that exist in watersheds influence these processes. Our work will address how interacting complexes of lakes, lake bottoms (littoral zones), streams, and their subsurface component (hyporheic zones) interact to influence nitrogen transport through watersheds in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho. We suggest that in simple watersheds without lakes or highly developed hyporheic zones, nutrients will runoff quickly during spring snowmelt so that little is left to fuel the growth of aquatic plants (phytoplankton, periphyton) latter in the summer. However, we expect that in complex watersheds with many lakes, the spring pulse of nitrogen will be dampened, thus providing a more stable supply of this nutrient than in simple watersheds. If nutrient delivery is stabilized, we expect that growth of phytoplankton and periphyton will also be less pulsed and thus increase ecosystem stability. We will test these ideas by measuring nutrient movement at small spatial scales with the stable isotope of nitrogen (15N), using those rates to model how nutrient transport occurs within whole watersheds, and then testing our model predictions with a whole-drainage tracer experiment and with large-scale watershed measurements of nutrient flux and algal growth in lakes and streams. To broaden the impact of our work, we will collaborate with educators to develop curricula for elementary school children, and make modules available for web-based learning."

Coordination between conversants' movements and/or facial expressions can be observed when an action generated by one individual is predictive of a symmetric movement by another: symmetry formation. The interplay between such symmetry formation and subsequent symmetry breaking in nonverbal behavior is integral to the process of communication and is diagnostic of the dynamics of human social interaction. The PIs propose a model in which low level contributions from audition, vision, and proprioception (the perception of the angle of our joints) are combined in a mirror system that assists affective and semantic communication through the formation and breaking of symmetry between conversants' movements, facial expressions and vocal prosody. In the current project, naive participants will engage in dyadic (one-on-one) conversations with trained laboratory assistants over a closed-circuit video system that displays a computer reconstructed version of the lab assistant's head and face. Both the naive participant's and the lab assistant's motions, facial expressions, and vocalizations will be recorded. The visual and auditory stimuli available to the naive participant will be manipulated to provide specific hypothesis tests about the strength and timing of the effects of head movement, facial expression, and vocal prosody. The visual manipulation will be provided by a photorealistic reconstructed avatar head (i.e., a computer animation) driven partially by tracking the lab assistant's head and face, and partially from manipulation of timing and amplitude of the avatar's movement and facial expression. A combined differential equations and computational model for the dynamics of head movements and facial expression will be constructed and tested in real-time substitution for lab assistant's head motion or facial expression as realized by the avatar. The broader impact of this project falls into three main areas: enabling technology for the study of human and social dynamics, applications to the treatment of psychopathology, applications to human-computer interface design and educational technology. (1) These experiments will result in the advancement of methods for testing a wide variety of hypotheses in social interaction where the research question involves a manipulation of perceived social roles. (2) Automated analysis of facial expression provides on-line analysis of social interactions in small group, high stress settings in which emotion regulation is critical such as in residential psychiatric treatment centers and in psychotherapist-client interactions. The reliability, validity, and utility of psychiatric diagnosis, assessment of symptom severity, and response to treatment could be improved by efficient measurement of facial expression and related non-verbal behavior, such as head gesture and gaze. (3) Successful outcomes from the computational models may lead to the development of automated computer interfaces and tutoring systems that could respond to students' facial displays of confusion or understanding, and thereby guide more efficient instruction and learning."

Research on plant lipids is vital and exciting with major new developments occurring in the areas of trafficking, subcellular organization, metabolic engineering, signaling, flux analysis, network regulation and other areas. As in many fields of plant biology and biochemistry, Arabidopsis has contributed enormously to rapid developments in the study of plant lipid metabolism. More recently, with the availability of the genomic information for plants and algae, there are several exciting new models to study lipid metabolism in an evolutionary context and in photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms adapted to extremely different ecological environments. It is proposed to address these and other newly emerging themes and opportunities in the plant lipid field during the upcoming 17th International Symposium on Plant Lipids. This project will provide: 1. partial support for registration and lodging costs for students, postdocs and other young scientists; 2. support for attendance of underrepresented minority scientists and researchers from minority-serving institutions. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Beyond the need to foster the interaction between an internationally dispersed group of plant lipid scientists, the envisioned balanced program is designed to: break new ground in integrating plant lipid research with work from non-plant systems; to provide speaking opportunities and exposure for young scientists and underrepresented groups from inside the US and abroad; and to attract colleagues who would not attend the meeting either because they are from other fields or because they cannot afford to participate. Therefore, this project will allow a diverse and widely-representative meeting that will accelerate progress and new developments in plant lipid research. To ensure the broadest possible participation, efforts will be made to widely publicize this meeting to attract scientists from small and large colleges, universities and research centers as well as small and large biotech companies. All participants will be asked to provide a manuscript for the proceedings of the meeting which will be edited by the organizers and posted as a pdf file at the meeting website."

Kaplan, Anthony K. Aufdenkampe, J. Denis Newbold, Robert H. Findlay, and Peggy H. Ostrom<br/><br/><br/>Naturally occurring organic molecules dissolved in water constitute the largest pool of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems. Within streams and rivers, molecules that originate in terrestrial vegetation and are modified within soils and groundwater by microorganisms during movement to the channel, are the dominant source of organic matter. These terrestrially derived molecules in transport downstream contribute to the biologically useful chemical energy present in freshwater and coastal marine environments. Our research uses a novel application of stable isotopes to quantify those contributions throughout a drainage network, and we frame our investigations within the context of scaling rules that facilitate the transfer of information from one habitat or system to others. We will grow young deciduous trees in an atmosphere enriched with the stable isotope of carbon, harvest and compost the trees, and extract the compost to prepare a leachate of complex, microbially modified molecules, and follow the fate of those organic molecules in systems which range from small laboratory reactors to a 5th order stream. Combining scaling rules derived from the knowledge of how streams ""grow"" as they flow towards the ocean with scaling rules associated with nutrient uptake in streams, allows us to test hypotheses concerning how organic molecules are used for energy within a stream network. <br/><br/>This research has broad implications for the use of scaling rules in ecological studies and for the drinking water industry where organic molecules provide both nutrients for the unwanted growth of microorganisms in distribution systems and the building blocks for the carcinogenic byproducts of disinfection. Our approach also may provide a predictive tool that can be used to learn about the fate and transport of anthropogenic contaminants that are transported downstream through their association with naturally occurring organic molecules."

The adaptive immune system evolved around 500 million years ago to provide immunological memory and protection against recurrent infection with the same agent.  To understand better how innate and adaptive immunity work together, the project seeks to identify the building blocks for adaptive immunity in sea lamprey, one of two living representatives of jawless vertebrates.  These experiments will identify genes that are selectively expressed by lamprey lymphocytes, the cell type responsible for adaptive immune responses in higher vertebrates, and genes expressed by phagocytic cells, key types of cells for innate immune responses.  Genes selectively expressed in these lamprey cell types will be compared with genes in higher vertebrates that are known to participate in innate and/or adaptive immunity.<br/>The goal is to elaborate features of innate and, possibly, the adaptive immune systems that have allowed lampreys to survive for the last 500 million years.  These studies will provide insight into how the adaptive immune system evolved in concert with innate immunity to allow higher vertebrates, including humans, to survive constant invasion by a variety of infectious microorganisms and toxins.  The information could also be helpful in devising means for biological control of predator sea lamprey that have devastated fish populations in the Great Lakes of North America.

It faces three challenges: to compile sufficient data, to integrate<br/>multiple databases, and to maintain tools that can assemble all the local data records into a geologic time<br/>line. The third challenge amounts to sequencing the fossil record and we propose to address three of the<br/>obstacles it faces: (1) Fossil biotas of the same age may differ as a result of habitat and preservation<br/>effects; (2) Very large data sets must be sequenced in smaller pieces and the results stitched seamlessly<br/>together; (3) Increasing numbers of dated and fingerprinted ash beds need to used more effectively. We<br/>propose a case study of manageable geographic and temporal extent that, nevertheless, raises these same<br/>issues. The Ordovician and Silurian periods span almost 100 million years of early Paleozoic time and are<br/>traditionally subdivided by graptolites and conodonts - two fossil clades with different ecological and<br/>preservational traits that restrict their use to largely mutually exclusive domains.<br/>The Mohawkian (Late Ordovician) of eastern North America presents precisely the type of<br/>challenging geological environment in which to build and test the temporal sequencing and stitching<br/>approaches that we envision. Mohawkian strata are widely exposed in the region and yield a rich fossil<br/>record that includes diverse, but somewhat endemic, conodont faunas. The epicratonic succession is<br/>rimmed along the Appalachian margin by deeper water sediments of the Taconic foreland basin. These<br/>strata contain a suite of inter-continentally distributed graptolite faunas, but few described conodont<br/>assemblages. Numerous altered volcanic ash deposits (K-bentonites) link these facies through a set of<br/>transitional facies along the interior basin margin. Despite these advantages, the prevalence of short<br/>sections, structural complexity, and facies limitation of the faunas impedes precise and reliable correlation<br/>between the cratonic and basinal successions, consequently limiting our ability to compare their disparate<br/>faunas and tectonic histories.<br/>Intellectual Merit: We propose to combine (1) geochemical fingerprinting (tephrochronology) and<br/>U-Pb geochronology of K-bentonites from the Mohawkian and early Cincinnatian with (2) a restudy of<br/>late Mohawkian conodonts and graptolites from eleven regions across eastern North America and (3)<br/>computer assisted sequencing of the global Ordovician conodont and graptolite fossil record. This work<br/>will provide a detailed temporal and paleoecological framework within which to refine the application of<br/>biofacies information to the temporal sequencing of the fossil record via rigorous quantitative techniques.<br/>We will focus in steps 1 and 2 particularly on conodont and graptolite-bearing successions that contain Kbentonites,<br/>and especially on regions where conodonts and graptolites occur in close association.<br/>The results of our work in a time interval that remains troublesome in spite of a wide range of timestratigraphic<br/>information will bear upon fundamental questions in both local and global stratigraphy. In<br/>the course of this study we will test existing alternate correlation models for the mid Upper Ordovician of<br/>central and eastern North America. The results will provide an improved, age-calibrated basis for studies<br/>of faunal turnover and diversity change in the Ordovician and Silurian.

The project meets the EARTHTIME goal of cross-training stratigraphers and<br/>geochronologists in developing high precision time-scales.

In humans, increasing evidence suggests that macroparasite (helminth) infections influence the susceptibility to and severity of microparasitic infections such as HIV and TB. However, much less is known about micro- and macroparasite interactions in wildlife, despite the high prevalence of co-infections in many natural systems. This research will examine interactions between gastrointestinal nematode infections and bovine tuberculosis in African buffalo at Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. Free-ranging TB-negative buffalo will be treated with a long-lasting anthelmintic drug in order to (1) test the effects of nematode removal on host susceptibility to TB infection by evaluating changes in host body condition and immunological parameters in response to treatment; and (2) determine the impact of treatment on TB transmission by comparing TB transmission rates in treated and untreated animals. By linking observed micro- and macroparasite infection patterns with underlying immunological, physiological and population dynamic mechanisms, this work will broaden understanding of the role parasite interactions play in the dynamics of infectious diseases in wildlife."

At the graduate level, under-representation among minority groups is even more striking than at the undergraduate level; for example, African Americans comprised just 8.5 percent of graduate school enrollments and Hispanics comprised just 5.2 percent of graduate school enrollments in 2000. The issue of under-representation may even be more important in California and Texas, which are the two largest states in the country in terms of population and two of the most racially and ethnically diverse states. The goal of this collaboration - which includes the University of Texas at Austin, Stanford University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Southern California -is to help address the under-representation of Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans in graduate programs in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE) at the four institutions. Specific focus will be to increase the enrollment, retention, and successful completion of under-represented minority students in the SBE sciences at the participating institutions, with the long-term intent to increase representation among under-represented minority groups on university faculties in the SBE sciences. Two principles guide efforts. Alliance partners will: 1) share ideas, best practices, and resources, and create a network to recruit and retain students for alliance universities; and 2) build on successful initiatives that have already been developed on each of the campuses so that efforts can be as cost-effective and successful as possible. <br/><br/>Highly collaborative and innovative methods will be used to improve efforts in recruiting and retaining minority graduate students at the institutions. Support NSF will be used to increase efforts in recruiting, retaining, and developing the careers of under-represented minority students. The Alliance plans to recruit cohorts of under-represented minority students on each campus, thus increasing minority graduate student enrollment in the SBE Sciences at each of our institutions, and to build on current efforts already ongoing at our universities and to build on the best practices that are already ongoing in the collaborative NSF-sponsored effort being undertaken by the three University of California schools<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>The program has the potential to influence the future of higher education in both California and Texas. The future of education in these two critical states in part depends on the ability of universities in these states (and elsewhere) to diversify the race/ethnic mix of faculty.

Using a variety of learning tools and supportive environments that have been developed by the KU Center for Research on Learning and the KU Center for Science Education, this SLC catalyst project will focus on the study of specific classes of visual representations including maps, online animations and animated graphics, and virtual three-dimensional environments.<br/><br/>The objectives of this research include building a broad ranging, inter-institutional research team that will initiate in-depth study of the connection between visual stimulus and learning from a variety of dynamic visual displays. The research team will integrate approaches from human perception, cognitive science, education, and information technology systems to investigate how humans extract, apprehend, and store information from complex graphical and dynamic visual displays. Pilot studies will examine how eye motion is linked to processes of obtaining and interpreting information from static displays (maps, graphs and charts), and dynamic visual displays (animations). Understanding how humans acquire information from visual displays, how the mind processes that information, and how humans progress from unskilled interpreters of visual information to experts, will guide the research team in the improvement of these visual displays so that they more effectively support learning.<br/><br/>We anticipate that outcomes of this research program will improve the design of visual displays used for learning. We expect these improvements to provide:<br/><br/>-New instructional strategies for sharing organizational knowledge<br/>-Software that better supports the development of virtual working and learning environments,<br/>-Continuity in the transfer of knowledge capital in government, business and education,<br/>-Tools to support knowledge generation, rather than knowledge hoarding, as a pathway to economic growth and workforce development,<br/>-Reduced cycle time in problem resolution, product development and the dissemination of information, and<br/>-More effective strategies for online learning assessments."

Lavas from each of these volcanoes have evolved along distinctive geochemical trends at different locations along the arc where orthogonal subduction rates and the inferred thermal state of the subduction system are different.

The unparalleled strength and chemical resistance of exine is important for pollen survival. This wall also plays an important role in interactions between male and female cells: exine is required for the species-specific adhesion that takes place between pollen and the female organs of the flowers. Exine is made of sporopollenin, an unusually strong, chemically inert and distinctively patterned biopolymer that may prove useful for the materials science industry. Thus, its importance in pollination, implications for polymer chemistry, and utility as a contact adhesive make an understanding of its composition a high priority. The inert and irregular nature of exine has confounded chemical analysis, but recent Arabidopsis genetic surveys are more promising, revealing genes and pathways required for exine structure and function. The work of the Preuss, Sumner, Edlund, and Swanson labs will extend these efforts. This project addresses the 2010 program goal of functional analysis of every Arabidopsis gene. It will assess the role of specific genes in exine assembly, patterning and adhesion, and will sort these genes into genetic and metabolic pathways. Arabidopsis genes required for establishing normal exine morphology will be defined by visually characterizing ~250 insertions in candidate genes, as well as by performing a large-scale screen for novel mutants. The targeted genes are selected among a) biosynthetic pathways previously implicated by chemical or genetic analyses as playing a role in exine synthesis; b) pathways with an unresolved role in exine synthesis; c) genes resembling those with a known function in exine development; d) genes, whose expression pattern indicates they are likely active in anthers during pollen development. The genes under study and progress of the research will be available at http://preuss.bsd.uchicago.edu/nsf2010.html. Data will be released generally on a semi-annual basis. For each of the mutants identified, microscopic and biochemical assays will be employed to characterize the roles of the mutated genes. Genetic and biochemical networks will then be clarified through characterizing the timing of exine gene expression, examining metabolite accumulation during pollen development, and analyzing double mutants. This work will impact multiple disciplines, improving the understanding of 1) genes that mediate pollination and crop breeding, 2) evolutionary control over exine diversity and plant speciation, 3) biopolymer self-assembly to allow investigators to recapitulate enzymatic steps of exine development in vitro, ultimately resulting in designing exine walls with desired characteristics, 4) exine moieties that contribute to pollen adhesion, possibly allowing the synthesis of highly specific contact adhesives, 5) >250 genes that could play a role in exine development. Education and personnel training will be an integral part of this project. Two technicians and at least 4 undergraduates (including 2 from the primarily undergraduate institutions - Spelman and Valparaiso) will be trained. Students, including those historically underrepresented in science, will have an opportunity for summer research, developing their experience in planning and performing experiments and presenting their work at research conferences. Their mentors will generate information to incorporate in their laboratories and courses. In addition, postdoctoral fellows will be trained in research and mentoring via supervising technicians and undergraduates, enabling transitions to independent careers."

The systematic west-to-east variation in erosion rate with relatively uniform lithologic and climatic conditions (with a known orographic rainfall pattern) in the San Gabriel Mountains affords an unprecedented opportunity to answer several key questions in landscape evolution. Six specific testable hypotheses that are critical to further development of a quantitative understanding of the relationship between tectonics and topography will be tested, and a specific suite of field sites and methods are identified that should yield definitive tests of these hypotheses as well as quantification of the underlying processes.

In the former, a particle is driven by its interaction with the non-homogeneous random medium, while in the latter, the particle interacts with other particles present. In the general RWRE model an environment is a collection of transition probabilities between lattice sites, and it is chosen from some mixing shift-invariant distribution. On the other hand, a class of deposition models, introduced by the first PI, not only provides a unified framework for many well-known particle systems, but also gives a broader view on common phenomena arising in such systems. An object of vital importance in particle systems, in spirit similar to a random walker in random environment, is the so-called second class particle. The main goal of these fields is the understanding of the consequences of the randomness in the environment, or caused by particle-particle interactions, respectively. Among the fundamental questions one can consider are the existence of 0-1 laws, law of large numbers, central limit theorems, large deviations, etc. The two fields are very close in spirit and ideas, just as an example, non-reversibility is a major obstacle in both fields to common applications. Sometimes even direct connections can be established between the two fields through different representations of the same system. This research contains an instance where a surface growth process is shown to be the dual of a RWRE model, allowing the flow of results from the latter to the former. Dual connections within the field of interacting systems are known to be a powerful tool. Analogously, drawing parallels between interacting systems and RWRE's allows for the exchange of methods, insights, and results.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that probabilistic intuition and techniques are often of great relevance to other areas of mathematics, this research has a direct impact on probability theory, combinatorics, statistical physics, and the theory of partial differential equations. The fields of random media and interacting systems also have various industrial, agricultural, sociological, and biological applications. Moreover the methods and problems in these fields are often easy to state, while the solutions involve sophisticated tools. This makes the subject appealing to graduate students and young researchers, generating more interest in probability theory."

It utilizes the bacterium Escherichia coli and the bacteriophage T7, a viral parasitoid of E. coli, as model coevolving organisms. Experiments in which dispersal and resource availability are directly manipulated will be combined with theoretical models that incorporate details of the host-parasitoid interaction to provide both qualitative and quantitative predictions of how dispersal across a heterogeneous landscape influences coevolution. This research provides a crucial middle ground between the relative simplicity of current mathematical models and the complexity of field studies. This research will add to our understanding of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution and metacommunity theory, which underlie much of the work on habitat fragmentation in conservation biology. This work will also increase our understanding of coevolving microbes, which perform many crucial ecosystem services and which have been vastly understudied.

Key driver behaviors benefiting from traffic information are pre-trip departure time changes, pre-trip and en-route route changes, and en-route anxiety reduction through drivers knowing the estimated arrival time. These behaviors depend on collecting and analyzing the planned route under changing traffic conditions and comparing that route with possible better alternatives. This research will develop user interfaces to collect origin, destination, and route information from drivers, pre-trip via the web and en-route via cell phone. Algorithms to determine alternate routes will be developed through analysis of field collected route data. Notification methods that present the salient information with minimal distraction will be developed and tested. The research will result in the development of better traffic information services that truly support the decisions drivers make as they travel.<br/><br/>The results of this research have potentially broad impacts on society. Traffic congestion is a growing problem in U.S. cities. In some areas, it has become a limiting factor on economic growth. Emphasis has shifted in recent years from providing additional capacity to better utilization of the existing infrastructure. Broad dissemination of traffic information in a form suitable for making optimal routing and trip decisions allows efficiency improvements based on the decentralized decisions of many drivers. Trip modifications based on traffic information can save drivers an estimated $3.9 billion in lost productivity, 225 million hours of travel time, and 340 million gallons of fuel, per year. It is believed that such savings could support a viable commercial marketplace for personalized traffic information. Similar savings are possible for commercial travel through improvements in delivery routing, on-time delivery, and more efficient dispatching. Congestion management by public agencies strives for efficient use of the public infrastructure by shifting motorists onto less congested roads and would benefit from better interfaces between the traffic data collected and the individual drivers on the roads. The examination of route choice will advance the scientific understanding of how drivers choose their routes and how they alter those routes under changing external conditions."

The Svalbard archipelago is already the site of numerous optical sensors and auroral imagers, multiple radars including EISCAT and SuperDARN, and is the location of the northernmost stations in the IMAGE array of fluxgate magnetometers. This extensive array of instrumentation has been installed on Svalbard primarily because it is the only readily accessible site in the northern hemisphere at which the ionospheric footpoint of the magnetospheric cusp is consistently in darkness during the winter solstice. Magnetic field lines from the cusp region map to the outer boundary of Earth's magnetosphere, where it interacts with the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field. Because of this, ground stations located under the cusp region can provide information about the first entry of energy and momentum from the solar wind to Earth's ionosphere. There is currently no search coil magnetometer array on Svalbard, however. Deployment of a closely-spaced two-dimensional array of search coil instruments, each with accurate GPS timing, will allow the PIs to determine phase differences between signals observed at different sites, and hence determine apparent propagation directions and infer wave source locations. In addition, the presence of a rich array of other instrumentation at several sites on Svalbard, especially under winter dark conditions, can provide detailed information on ionospheric regions that is not available at any other cusp latitude site. <br/><br/>This study will contribute to our understanding of, and ability to predict, space weather phenomena that can cause power outages and increase pipeline corrosion, produce radiation damage to satellites, and create problems in radio communications, amongst other problems."

The ethical conduct of investigators is critical to both progress in the sciences and public support for the scientific enterprise. Although many interventions exist that might be used to enhance ethical conduct, instructional interventions remain the most common. Unfortunately, these instructional interventions often have limited impact because they are not embedded in the day-to-day practices of the field and the strategies people apply in resolving ethical issues encountered in the course of their work. The intent of the proposed effort is to develop and evaluate a professional practice model for research ethics education. Initially, qualitative anthropological analyses of the professional practices and issue resolution strategies applied in a multi-disciplinary applied research center will be conducted. The results of these observational analyses will be used to identify day-to-day ethical issues arising in multidisciplinary centers, and social cognitive strategies used to resolve the work problems posed by these issues. Based on this information, an instructional program will be developed that is based on: 1) key actions leading to problem resolution, 2) effective strategies for executing these actions, and 3) practical steps that will support effective application of these strategies. This training will be delivered at four institutions participating in a multi-disciplinary center. The training will use an embedded instructional approach, involving both students and faculty in cooperative learning exercises intended to illustrate and provide practice in the application of effective strategies for resolving ethical issues arising in a center context. The effectiveness of this program will be evaluated using a multiple-site, multi-method approach that appraises program results with respect to individual-level outcomes (e.g., knowledge structures, decision-making) group-level outcomes (e.g., local site ethical climate, negative events), organizational-level outcomes (e.g., cross-site collaborations, new projects initiated by the center). If positive results are obtained in this multi-level, multi-measure evaluation effort, the program will be disseminated to other interdisciplinary centers and relevant fields in science and engineering. <br/>Intellectual Merit: This effort will provide an initial test of whether ethics education models based on day-to-day professional practice will provide a basis for the development of more effective educational programs. Additionally, this effort will help to identify the unique ethical issues arising in large multi-disciplinary applied research centers and the kind of strategies that can be applied to resolve these issues. Finally, this effort will provide measures for assessing ethical conduct, illustrating the impact of ethical conduct on individual, groups and organizational outcomes. <br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed effort will provide a new type of model curriculum that might be used to provide an alternative to the curricula currently being applied in ethics education in science and engineering fields. Additionally, key strategies for resolving the ethical issues encountered in applied multi-disciplinary research centers will be identified. An ethical education curriculum and evaluation measures will be developed for the three fields (meteorology, computer science, and electrical engineering) involved in the center being studied. Finally, new procedures for developing a curriculum addressing day-to-day ethical issues encountered in professional practice will be identified."

The walls of these interstellar shells mainly consist of neutral gas that are sometimes highlighted by ionized gas and/or synchrotron emission. Since the shell cavities themselves often contain hot and ionized X-ray emitting gas, these features must play an important role in shaping the structure of the whole Galaxy. They therefore provide an important diagnostic of the way in which both the energy and matter released by stars are redistributed in the Milky Way. Although the expansion of these shells is thought to be driven by stellar winds from massive OB stars and/or supernovae, there are too many large shells requiring energy input, and alternate explanations have failed to solve the problem. This work, led by Dr. Shauna Sallmen, seeks to improve the observational sample of well-studied shells by (1) searching the database of the SETHI radio survey project for previously unidentified neutral shells (2) creating narrow-band optical (e.g. H-alpha) maps with high angular resolution and (3) using absorption-line spectroscopy to find the distance to absorption components of the expanding shell walls, and probe the physical conditions of this gas.<br/><br/>Among existing neutral-hydrogen surveys, maps created using the SETHI database have a unique<br/>combination of sensitivity, spectral resolution, and angular resolution. These provide an excellent<br/>resource for identifying new expanding shells. Narrow-band H-alpha maps with extremely high angular resolution will be created in selected cases. These will be combined with the SETHI maps, along with archival data at other wavelengths, to form a coherent picture of these shells. Such multi-wavelength studies are essential to understanding the interplay between hot and cold gas in these shells. Spectroscopic studies to stellar targets lying at a range of distances towards the shells will complement emission observations for these and other shells. Absorption measurements of NaI can isolate the distances and velocities to cold neutral features, while CaII measurements allow the researchers to probe the differences between the cold neutral gas and slightly warmer gas. In addition to revealing the velocity structure, physical location, and size of shells, such observations provide details about the physical conditions of the gas within the shell.<br/><br/>This project will spearhead the development of a cohesive undergraduate astrophysics research program at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, as well as establishing a research program for Dr. Sallmen. By funding research in the discipline of astronomy, this project will bring the Astronomy Emphasis in line with other disciplines within Dr. Sallmen's academic Department, and<br/>provide a foundation for future astronomy research programs at this institution. The department encourages undergraduate research, believing that such experiences both enhance student interest, and improve student preparation. More students currently wish to participate in astronomy research than can be accommodated. The establishment of an undergraduate astronomical research community will help retain physics students whose main interest is astrophysics. Many freshman women are interested in astrophysics. Enhanced research options in astronomy should also increase women's enrollment in physics. Resources initiated by this project will remain in place for future research programs. Computer equipment and software dedicated to undergraduate astronomy research, closer ties with collaborators at other institutions, and undergraduates with experience in observing and analyzing data are all benefits which will not end when data for the targets of this proposal have been analyzed.

Much of this data originates from on-line sensors that act as streaming data sources, providing a continuous flow of information. As sensor sources proliferate, the flow of data becomes a deluge, and the extraction and delivery of important features in a timely and comprehensible manner becomes an ever increasingly difficult problem. More specifically, developing data mining and assimilation tools for data deluged applications faces three fundamental challenges. The amount of distributed real time streaming data is so large that even current extreme scale computing cannot effectively process it. Second, today's broadly deployable network protocols and web services do not provide the low latency and high bandwidth required by high volume real time data streams and distributed computing resources connected<br/>over networks with high bandwidth delay products. Finally, the vast majority of today's statistical and data mining algorithms assume that all the data is co-located and at rest in files. Here, the real time data streams are distributed and the applications that consume them must be optimized to process multiple high volume real time streams. The goal is to develop novel algorithms and hardware acceleration schemes to allow real-time statistical modeling and change detection on such large-scale streaming data sets. By using Service Oriented Architecture principles, a framework for integrating high -performance change detection software services, including accelerations of commonly used kernels in statistical modeling, into a Grid messaging substrate will be developed and tested. Geographical Information System (GIS) services will be supported using<br/>Open Geospatial Consortium standards to enable geo-referencing. <br/><br/>This project has the potential to have near-term and long-term impact in several important areas. In the near-term, the implementation of kernels and modules of statistical modeling and change detection algorithms will allow the end-user applications (e.g., homeland security, defense) to achieve one to two orders of magnitude improvement in performance for data driven decision support. In the longer term, the availability of toolkits and kernels for the change detection and data mining algorithms will facilitate the development of applications in many areas including defense, security, science and others. Furthermore, this research will bring the use of reconfigurable<br/>architectural acceleration of functions on streaming data including change detection and data mining, thereby opening new avenues of research and enabling newer data-driven applications on complex datasets. Both graduate and undergraduate students (through undergraduate fellowships) are engaged in the research. In addition, team members actively engage with minority serving institutions using audio/video and distance education tools."

There is a growing shift in knowledge work, including product design, software development and business processes, to places such as Taiwan, India, China, the Philippines and Ireland, and the trend shows no signs of slowing. Some often argue that the shift of knowledge work offshore will lead to the loss of millions of U.S. jobs. Others make the case that there will be significant cost and efficiency gains for the whole economy, and that jobs will be created in newer entrepreneurial firms and industries even as more mature industries move work offshore. Given these conflicting views and potential impacts, the issue is of great interest and concern to U.S. companies, workers and policy makers. What is currently lacking is a solid empirical understanding of the dynamics underlying this phenomenon, how large it may become, and what its consequences might be. A first step is to look closely at the sourcing decisions of firms and the factors that influence them. The most obvious are economic factors, in particular, differences in wage rates and other costs between the U.S. and other countries. In addition, relational factors associated with geographical proximity or social networks are likely to come into play. Finally, information and computer technologies (ICTs) can be used to improve the productivity of U.S. knowledge workers and help keep work onshore, but also can facilitate offshoring by enabling better coordination of activities across borders and geographic distance. In order to understand the offshore sourcing of knowledge work, and its potential scope and impacts, the proposed research will address the following questions: 1) What are the dynamics of economic and relational factors and ICTs in determining whether knowledge work is moved offshore? 2) How do these dynamics differ depending on the nature and maturity of a knowledge activity, and 3) What are the impacts of sourcing decisions on firm performance, and the potential impacts on employment in the U.S.? The research will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team from economics, computer science and management in two interrelated activities: (1) intensive qualitative fieldwork in eight companies aimed at generating a theoretical model and formal hypotheses, and (2) quantitative analysis to refine, formalize and test the model on a large-scale survey sample of 800 firms. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The research is socially significant because overseas relocation of knowledge-based activities has important implications for U.S. economic prosperity, potentially affecting jobs, trade, innovation, and industry competition. It is important to know whether there are limits to the amount of knowledge-based work that can be relocated offshore. It is also important to understand whether the deployment of ICTs might be a source of competitive advantage for U.S. firms and workers, or whether their global diffusion will tend to level the playing field with other countries. Finally, it is important to measure the effects of offshore sourcing on firm performance, in order to understand the both costs and benefits."

It has recently been found that synthesis of two polyamines, putrescine and spermidine, increases following injury of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). Furthermore, spermidine has been shown to promote outgrowth of neurites in the PC12 cell model of sympathetic neurons, suggesting a possible involvement in the regenerative process. In the work supported by this proposal, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the ability of spermidine to promote outgrowth will be investigated. Specifically, the ability of spermidine to alter the activation state of members of the Rho family of GTPases will be examined; this family of proteins is involved in cell shape changes. Since regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) is inhibited, in part, by myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), the ability of spermidine to promote neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells grown on this normally inhibitory substrate will be tested. Finally, the involvement of the Rho GTPases in the spontaneous regeneration that occurs following injury of the SCG will be investigated. The nerves exiting the SCG in adult male rats will be transected, and the activation states of the Rho GTPases will subsequently be analyzed. Together, these studies are intended to elucidate the molecular pathway by which spermidine promotes neurite outgrowth in vitro (in the PC12 cells) as well as to uncover a similar function during spontaneous regeneration of the adult rat SCG in vivo. <br/><br/>The proposed work will provide educational opportunities for undergraduate students, allowing them to participate in an active research environment beyond the scope of typical classroom or laboratory instruction. Students will be able to address questions within the realm of neurobiology while learning techniques of cell and molecular biology. Such opportunities will further prepare students for research careers and for graduate school."

These estimates will help to understand the timing of and the connections between some of the most dramatic changes in North Pacific sedimentation in the past 100,000 years. <br/>Climate-linked changes in the composition of sediments from the eastern Pacific continental margin (organic content, lamination) are well documented, but it has been difficult to determine the cause of these changes. Some studies have implicated changes in upper ocean productivity, while others assign a dominant role to changes in ventilation of the intermediate-depth bottom waters in their northwest Pacific outcrop regions. It is important to determine the contributions from each of these two mechanisms because they each imply different climate forcing. Productivity-based explanations for organic rich / laminated sediments imply changes in the physical and biological conditions of the surface ocean (wind field, stratification, nutrients) all along the eastern margin of the Pacific. In contrast, ventilation-based explanations imply changes in the factors that control dense water formation in the high-latitude North Pacific (winds, stratification, sea ice formation). <br/>The proponents will determine benthic-planktonic 14C age differences on key deglacial intervals from a set of sediment cores from water depths ranging between 1 and 4 km in the northwest Pacific and the Okhotsk Sea and from a new set of Bering Sea cores over a similar depth range. To complement these radiocarbon-based ventilation estimates, they will use the d13C difference between pairs of co-existing benthic foraminifera to estimate bottom water oxygen concentrations over the same depth range and time intervals, and they will use the accumulation rate of benthic foraminifera to estimate the flux of organic matter to the sea floor. These three sets of data (B-P .14C, d 13C, and BFAR) will document the relationships between ventilation rate, bottom water chemistry, and carbon flux from the LGM through the deglacial. The data may help resolve the long-standing debate about the role of productivity versus the role of bottom water ventilation in controlling the accumulation of organic-rich sediments and laminated sediments at intermediate depths throughout the eastern Pacific. <br/>The project will provide half-time postdoctoral support for two years."

One controversial area is the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast, where two contrasting models have persisted in the literature for decades and have seen renewed support from recent NSF-sponsored research. One model views sea level as continually rising through the last 6,000 to 7,000 years, whereas the other holds that sea level reached present elevations 6,000 to 7,000 years ago and has oscillated within 1 to 2 meters of present elevations since that time. Past research along the Gulf Coast has been undertaken in different areas and by different investigators using different methods. These conflicting models have not been reconciled, and it remains uncertain whether disparate results reflect inherent spatial variability in sea-level change, differences in resolution of the various methods used, or some combination of the two. This collaborative research brings together investigators that have produced conflicting results but who now will apply their respective approaches to the same field areas. The researchers will focus on non-subsiding, non-deltaic sites in southwestern Louisiana, Alabama, and northwestern Florida. Major goals of the project are (1) the documentation of Holocene (ground) water-level change from studies of basal peats in non-deltaic marsh sediments; (b) definition of precise sea-level indicators in modern chenier and beach-ridge deposits; and (c) tracking of changes in the elevation of sea-level indicators through time within chenier and beach ridge stratigraphic records. This approach is expected to produce high-resolution relative sea-level curves for each study area from basal-peat data and from chenier and beach-ridge deposits so as to reconcile the two approaches and provide an internally consistent picture of sea-level change and its spatial variability. Each curve will be calibrated to precise GPS elevations and will be anchored by radiocarbon and/or optically stimulated luminescence dating.<br/><br/>Development of a more precise and integrated understanding of relative sea-level change and its spatial variability along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast will have a number of disciplinary and regional implications. Existing models for sea-level change have significantly different implications for global climate and ice volume reconstructions as well as for studies of regional coastal landscape evolution, of human adaptations to past sea-level change, and of the ways that coastal systems might respond to future climate and sea-level change. Sea-level change is also one of the most pressing problems in human-environment interactions along the Gulf of Mexico coast, especially along the Mississippi delta, where billions of dollars will be invested in coastal restoration.

The PI will also extend earlier preliminary studies indicating that filaments exhibit both systematic and sporadic increases in their overall height and in the velocities of their mass motions during several days preceding filament eruption. As part of the broader impacts, the modeling, analyses, and acquisition of new observations will involve at least one postdoc and at least six undergraduate students."

UMC has a long-term goal of integrating videobased PSLs into study modules suitable for K-12 teacher training. Video based labs and software associated with pre-lab quizzes are being expanded to facilitate distance education. The UND counterpart project utilizes technical expertise gained by the Minnesota group to set up a PSL system in introductory physics courses on campus. In particular, UND is using (1) TA training materials, (2) more effective collaborative problem-solving lab instruction, (3) a version of PSL manuals for non-majors customized for UND, (4) a computerized pre-lab quiz system. The project aims to increase the impact of laboratory exercises on student learning by enforcing more active student involvement. The project is being evaluated by an evaluator at another neighboring university. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the activity is that it is investigating the impact on student learning of changing the laboratory instruction system and thus evaluating the PSL system in the context of another state university with different infrastructure and different constraints. It does this by comparing against a baseline that has already been developed. The project addresses weaknesses uncovered by student surveys with content retention questions, student assessment and other measures. The new system applies leverage to get at these fundamental points. Its effectiveness is amenable to quantitative measurement. The project is a large-scale attempt to bring about improvement through systemic change.<br/><br/>Broader impact of the project is that all service courses come under a cycle of measurement-based incremental improvement. Working with U of M and UMC is particularly beneficial for gaining a knowledge base for developing K-12 physics teacher training courses and workshops and also for development of effective distance learning courses.<br/><br/>The expectations for student comprehension are raised, and labs are coordinated more closely with lectures. Computerized pre-lab quizzes, if successful, could generalize to wider application in the curriculum. The degree to which the implementation succeeds at UND (not untypical of many Midwestern universities) will be analyzed and a report submitted for publication. The project has direct impact on the involvement of women in the department (25% of GTAs and the project coordinator). Curriculum materials are available in public domain via the internet."

These authors speculated that the acoustic memory effect might be tied to the pinning and relaxation of ferroelectric domain walls within the crystal. The physical model is definitely very speculative at this point and requires experimental verification. The objective of this proposed research is to verify the pinning and relaxation of domain walls as a source of acoustic memory observed in LiNbO3. Another objective is to develop a basic understanding of the role of domain walls on acoustic wave propagation, reflection and nonlinear effects. Also, acoustic wave detection may provide a sensitive nondestructive method for imaging of ferroelectric domains.<br/><br/>The application of ferroelectric crystals like LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 with periodic domain structures gives the possibility of realizing a new class of acoustoelectronic devices such as SAW transducers, filters, delay lines, frequency standards and analog signal processing. Because of the large optic nonlinearities, the crystals can be used in devices such as electro-optic modulators, parametric oscillators, and harmonic generators. Also, the piezoelectric properties allow application in the accelerometers, x-y positioners, ultrasonic cleaners, gas sensors, and ultrasonic wire bonders.<br/><br/><br/>In addition to advancing the development of the science, engineering, and<br/>manufacturing technology in ferroelectric materials, the proposed research will find applications in educational activity such as in the development of a course on optoelectronic materials, devices and applications as well as practical applications."

At the same time, advances in semide.nite programming algorithms have resulted in several high-quality and freely available semide.nite programming software packages. These general-purpose solvers exploit some (sparse) problem structure, and can solve fairly large problem instances. However, for control and signal processing applications, which often involve matrix variables and dense linear matrix inequality constraints, there remains a substantial gap between the capabilities of the best solvers and the requirements for applications in practice. The main goal of this proposal is to narrow this gap, by developing fast algorithms for some speci.c classes of semide.nite programs that are important in control and signal processing. The proposal focuses on semide.nite programs in which the coe.cient matrices can be expressed as di.erent linear combinations of a small set of low-rank matrices. This type of<br/>structure is common and includes the important class of semide.nite programs derived from sum-of-squares representations of nonnegative polynomials. A second goal of the project is to investigate new applications of semide.nite programming to graphical modeling and time series analysis, and in particular the estimation of linear models with conditional independence constraints on pairs of variables.<br/>Intellectual merit The project will result in improved algorithms and software for solving important classes of semide.nite programming problems, by combining techniques from system theory (nonnegative polynomials), numerical analysis (discrete transforms and orthogonal polynomials) and optimization (interior-point methods).<br/>Broader impacts Software based on the research results will be made freely available, which will contribute to a more widespread adoption of semide.nite programming techniques. The results will be integrated in the graduate optimization sequence in the Electrical Engineering Department at UCLA. We also plan to o.er undergraduate research opportunitiesvia summer internships.

During the Phase I project the feasibility of the proposed electro-optic PBG technology has been demonstrated. High quality EO film, La-modified PMN-PT (PLMNT), was successfully deposited using a unique metal-organic chemical liquid deposition (MOCLD) technique, a low cost and efficient manufacturing process. A large EO coefficient was achieved from PLMNT films. An innovative metallic/dielectric PBG structure was designed and studied for device applications. An electro-optic filter/modulator was developed. A two-dimensional PBG structure was demonstrated for efficient wavelength tuning through simulation. In Phase II based on this Phase I work, new generation tunable PBG material and devices, such as filters and modulators with state-of-the-art performance, will be brought to the marketplace.<br/><br/>Commercially photonic bandgap materials promise to give similar control of the flow of photons as there is over electrons in a semiconductor material but with even greater flexibility because there is far more control over the properties of photonic bandgap materials than the electronic properties of semiconductors. Given the impact that semiconductor materials have had on every sectors of society, photonic bandgap materials could play an even greater role in the 21st century, particularly in the optical-communications industry. Not only can this material be made into common PBG passive components, such as cavities, waveguides, or couplers, but also the active and dynamic ones, such as high-speed modulator and tunable filters. These advanced devices will have great applications in industrial, space, and military sectors."

The sequencing of the human genome has resulted in a phenomenal increase in the identification of such protein domains, but their molecular functions or their roles in human cellular physiology are poorly understood. Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure or shape of a protein domain helps infer its molecular function in biology. This project aims to develop a new structure-based paradigm for genome-wide profiling of molecular functions of protein domains. To achieve this goal, the researchers will use a family of protein domains, called the bromodomain, as a model system. The bromodomain functions to interact with acetylated lysine (a chemically modified natural amino acid) on a protein. Such a molecular interaction plays a fundamental role in establishing a network of dynamic protein-protein interactions in a wide range of cellular processes including gene expression. Despite their fundamental functions in human cell biology, target selectivity of human bromodomains, a large family containing more than 170 members, is not understood. Notably, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (brewers' yeast) has only 15 bromodomains that functionally represent different subsets of the much larger human family. As such, new knowledge of target selectivity of the yeast bromodomains can be extended to understand the functions of the human bromodomains. Towards this goal, this project employs a new strategy of combining structure-based experimental and computational methods to profile target selectivity of bromodomains from yeast to human. <br/><br/>The outcome from this research is expected to yield mechanistic understanding of the fundamental and complex cellular functions of biological machineries in a wide array of cellular processes. Successful establishment of new computation-based prediction methodology using combined and iterative experimental and computational approaches being developed in this project will greatly enhance our ability to use the highly valuable information coded within genome sequences. In addition, this project will be used as a vehicle to provide interdisciplinary graduate training, both in the researchers' labs and through courses offered through the Biophysics, Structural Biology and Biomathematics Multidisciplinary Training Area in the Graduate School of Biological Sciences."

Billions of larvae are produced each year by benthic invertebrates, and probably comprise a higher proportion of the plankton at midwater depths than in shallow waters dominated by crustacean zooplankters. The food sources for deep-sea larvae remain largely unresolved. In preliminary studies, bathyal echinoderm larvae reared in natural water from below the deep chlorophyll maximum consumed significant numbers of cyanobacteria, organisms so small that they should not easily sink into those depths. The implication is that these deep-sea larvae may swim actively up to shallower depths for the purpose of feeding.  In this project, the investigators will examine the vertical distributions of larval forms and their potential microbial food sources in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas, focusing especially on the potential role of cyanobacteria, picoeukaryotes, and heterotrophic bacteria as food sources for migrating deep-sea larvae. A multidisciplinary team will measure larval metabolism, swimming and feeding activity; and the physiological status of potential food organisms in deep water. Empirical data will be incorporated into an energetics model that predicts the likelihood of ontogenetic migration to the euphotic zone for larvae originating at bathyal depths. In keeping with their past record outreach and education at both the college and k-12 levels, the investigators will provide extensive and intensive learning opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in hands-on multidisciplinary research. A college course, Biology of the Deep-sea Benthos, will be taught at sea, as it has been during previous NSF sponsored projects. Cruises will have internet components that will engender excitement in the adventure of science through web postings directly from the cruises. The investigators also will continue their involvement with outreach efforts including a regular public lecture series and a university program that provides seminar speakers to undergraduate and predominantly minority institutions."

This project addresses a central question--if the South African apartheid city was planned for segregation, can the post-apartheid city be planned for integration? An interdisciplinary team of social, physical and spatial scientists brings a multidimensional perspective to investigate the transformative effects of planned intervention in a highly uncertain and unequal environment. The South African experience provides a critical test case of the ability of a high capacity state to be an agent of change, capable of reversing the accumulated inequalities of the past. Mixed methods research will be conducted in two stages over three years. The first stage will involve collection and analysis of spatial data on infrastructural development, economic development, and racial segregation from the three megacities. Data will be collected from 1991 - as a baseline that marks the height of segregation and the end of legalized apartheid - to the present. For each of the three cities, georeferenced census data will be combined with infrastructural, economic, and racial data to produce maps at three time points of racial and economic segregation. Local areas of significant integration and exclusion will be identified, which will be further studied in the second stage, a qualitative analysis.

Mathematical models will be made to predict performance and used to help design longer lasting lower resistance miniature electrical switches.<br/><br/>The societal impact of this research includes educational and industrial benefits. Modern society cannot function without electronics, and electronic devices cannot function without reliable high quality switches. As electronics shrink, so must the switches. Educationally, a recent MIT Ph.D. graduate, who has been teaching inner-city high school students, and students, from OSU and MIT will work together to develop new nanoscience-centered teaching materials for use in core math an science classes. Industrially, this research will enable the creation of lower resistance longer life electrical contacts. The industrial partner will be able to make smaller electrical probes for testing silicon microchips."

Accurately predicting these by resolving the finest scales in a computer simulation is prohibitively expensive. The investigators are studying how fine scale information impacts coarse scale behavior and vice versa. In effect, ""summarizing"" these relationships allow us to model coarse scale effects accurately and efficiently without the need to explicitly resolve the finest scales in a computation. A key to this study lies in the careful transfer of structures present in the mathematical models of these phenomena (which in essence have infinite resolution) to the computational realm with its finite resolution and finite computational resources. The methods being developed will allow rapid assessment of overall effects with the ability ""to drill down"" computationally where additional detail is required.<br/><br/>Physical systems are typically described by a set of continuous equations using tools from geometric mechanics and differential geometry to analyze and capture their properties. For purposes of computation one must derive discrete (in space and time) representations of the underlying equations. Theories which are discrete from the start (rather than discretized after the fact), with key geometric properties built in, can more readily yield robust numerical simulations which are true to the underlying continuous systems: they exactly preserve invariants of the continuous systems in the discrete computational realm. So far these methods have not accounted for effects across scales. Yet both physics and numerical computation require such multi-resolution strategies. This research project is developing a multi-resolution theory for discrete variational methods and discrete differential geometry with applications to thin-shell and fluid modeling. The principal scientific innovation lies in techniques to conserve symmetries across computational scales."

Waltman to work with Dr. Erick M. Carreira at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), in Zurich, Switzerland.<br/><br/>Traditionally, many drug candidates are organic compounds derived from, or inspired by compounds obtained from, natural sources. The complexity and challenge of these natural products has driven the discovery of new methods of constructing them. Such endeavors are further complicated by the fact that most advanced organic compounds are chiral, meaning that they have two mirror-image orientations of atoms in space, called enantiomers. Often, the synthesis of safe and effective drugs requires that organic compounds are made as only one of these mirror images. Unfortunately, it is not often easy to selectively form only one of two potential enantiomers. A major component of modern synthetic organic research is the development of reactions that are enantioselective, meaning that they selectively form only a single enantiomer (enantiomers). One very large class of organic compounds, the indole alkaloids, offers especially promising targets for synthesis. Among the indole alkaloids, there is a large class of compounds that feature a molecular architecture called a spiro[pyrrolidine] unit, which is particularly difficult to form. Recently, an efficient approach to these molecules has been developed in the host laboratory. Using this technique, several non-enantioselective syntheses of very complicated organic molecules have been achieved. This project will involve the modification of the previously discovered reaction to render it enantioselective. Once this goal has been met, the second task will be to apply this approach in the enantioselective synthesis of a complicated organic molecule, Pauciflorine A. Pauciflorine A, or compounds related to it, may one day serve as skin cancer therapies, since it has been observed to inhibit melanin biosynthesis in melanoma cells. Beyond this, the enantioselective formation of the spiro[pyrrolidine] unit may aid in the synthesis of a large number of indole alkaloids, thereby expanding the scope of compounds attainable by organic chemists. Many of these may possess novel medicinal value of their own. <br/><br/>The laboratory of Prof. Carreira is at the forefront of synthetic organic research."

Specifically, the project centers on two issues: 1) how hydraulic engineering was shaped by, and in turn shaped, state-building, national identity, and the pursuit of modernity, and 2) how the environment of the North China Plain was transformed by hydraulic engineering. The research will explore the state-nature nexus after 1949 by distinguishing differing state values and goals. The state pursued Soviet-style central planning for much of the 1950s, Great Leap Forward decentralization and communalization between 1958-1961, a blend of state planning and mass mobilization during the early 1960s (1961-65) and 1970s, the Cultural Revolution (1966-69), and ""market socialism"" of the post-Mao era (1978-). <br/><br/>Intellectual Merits<br/>The project will examine hydraulic engineering projects during these periods and develop conclusions on how these projects were reflections of state goals. Comparative conclusions about the environmental consequences of these periods will be guided by examining fundamental tensions that informed hydraulic engineering, and that reflected differing assumptions about the nation, state, and modernity. These tensions included: 1) modern technology vs. mass mobilization, 2) central vs. local planning, 3) international technical cooperation vs. self-reliance, and 4) economic development vs. environmental protection. This study on the intersections between the state, hydraulic engineering, and nature is influenced by past scholarship on the social context of science and technology. Specifically, the research is heavily influenced by recent scholarship that examines the ""co-construction"" of nation and nature, and that recognizes the critical role of the state as actor in the discourses of modernity, technology, and nature. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This research will fill a void in science and technology studies, and environmental historical studies of China, and will offer research valuable to other comparative studies. Much of the scholarship on the relationship between states and nature has focused on western cultural regions. This research will recognize that critical elements of Chinese society indeed subscribed to fundamental twentieth-century conceptions of state, science and technology, and nature reflected in industrialized societies. At the same time, however, the Chinese state's socio-political values, goals, and institutions generated a particular cultural context of hydraulic engineering in China after 1949. The project will also foster a more nuanced view of China's contemporary reform program. Understanding how hydraulic engineering and technology were embedded in a particular historical and cultural context since 1949 allows one to recognize and understand the range of choices available to China's water policy planners. The conclusions of this study will also suggest the potential implications of resource depletion on China's role in world markets and on China's security considerations. Declining agricultural productivity, one consequence of water scarcity, will influence China's internal and external actions in important ways. The research will be suggestive of China's potential impact on world agricultural markets and its increasing presence in regional and global security arrangements."

Unlike the diverse microbiota of the gut, bacteria of the nephridia appear to form stable and specific associations such that particular species of earthworms harbor their own species of symbiotic Acidovorax. In addition, a second bacterial symbiont related to Actinobacteria was recently discovered in Eisenia fetida, suggesting even greater diversity among earthworm symbionts. The diversity of the bacteria associated with different earthworm taxa and their contribution to the success of earthworms are virtually unexplored. This collaborative research project integrates morphological identification and genetic sequence information to identify earthworms and their associated symbiotic bacteria from several continents. A suite of genes that have shown previous success in determining relationships among organisms has been selected to be sequenced. The data will be used to determine the genetic relationships among both the host earthworms and their bacterial partners to establish evolutionary patterns for this association. Discovery of novel species of both the host and symbiont is expected as well as a better understanding of the diversity of the earthworms and their associated bacteria. This research is crucial for understanding the processes occurring in the soil that influence soil chemistry and fertility through the activity of these widespread members of soil systems. Furthermore, one of the symbiotic bacterial lineages may be a source of novel anti-microbial compounds. The diversity and global distribution of earthworms offers an opportunity for the evolution of bacterial symbionts with potential for new bioactive compounds and enzymes.<br/><br/>International collaborations are a necessary part of the research to accomplish collections from several continents and contribute to an international effort to accumulate sequences for rapid organism identification (""BarCode of Life"").

Wisconsin has almost 70,000 teachers in 426 school districts. Many of these school districts are small and rural, such that students only have a choice of one high school and junior high. This project will target teachers and career counselors in secondary schools, a crucial age range when girl students lose interest and confidence in their abilities in science and math.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>OWWSTE will work closely with the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, the Wisconsin Science Network, and the Wisconsin Academy for Staff Development Initiatives (WASDI) to identify school districts that have a particularly low percentage of women taking upper level science, math and technology courses. Administrators in these agencies will also assist in identifying appropriate counselor and teacher leaders from school districts. Numerous faculty leaders from the University of Wisconsin System, particularly faculty who were trained by the NSF sponsored Women and Science Project, will also be involved with teacher and counselor training sessions.<br/><br/>While Wisconsin has many active science and engineering programs geared toward girls and young women, many teachers and counselors are unaware of these valuable programs. The workshop and instructional materials funded by this program will focus on successful programs, particularly those easily accessible to students in the upper Midwest, and techniques for secondary educators to increase enrollment of women in upper level high school science and technology courses. Additionally, discussions with program leaders will demonstrate methods to avoid gender biases in science, math, and technology education. Finally, educators will become more aware of programs and techniques to introduce their promising female students to career paths that they had not imagined previously.<br/><br/>Teacher and counselors will leave the summer workshop with the tools and information necessary to disseminate to train fellow educators in their districts.

Similar programs that have been implemented in other states have seen significant gains in female student participation and enrollment in STEM courses. This program will be evaluated by surveys of female senior and juniors at participating high schools related to their career goals. An increase of 10% of female student declaring an interest in majoring in science, engineering or technology will be considered a success for this program."

One of the major factors contributing to changes in genome size is the ability of plants to survive increases in the number of chromosomes (polyploidization); most plant species are thought to have undergone whole genome duplications (autopolyploidization) or hybridizations between different species (allopolyploidization). These events are often accompanied by chromosome rearrangements, fusions and loss. Nonetheless, the resulting chromosomes must contain a single centromere that ensures their inheritance during cell division. This project aims to understand how chromosomes maintain a single centromere, while preserving essential genes - using genomics technology, it will explore how plants eliminate extra centromeres and how they create new centromeres. The research will be performed by comparing the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to the genomes of its closest relatives. A. thaliana has undergone several polyploidization, genome rearrangement and DNA loss events, producing a species with only 5 chromosomes and an extremely compact genome. The information gained from this project will broadly impact the understanding of plant genomes and their evolution. It will also clarify the changes associated with the formation of new centromeres (neocentromeres), which can lead to cancer in mammalian cells and genomic instability in crops. This program will also provide research opportunities for minority undergraduate students and will provide a senior postdoctoral associate experience in mentoring graduate students. The results of this work will be published and will also be presented in venues that educate the public and policy makers in plant genetic engineering."

The proposed sensor is totally passive, i.e., do not require an on board power source, and thus avoid problems associated with radiation damage to active electronics (transistors, etc). The transponder is based on a novel device structure combining the quasi-permanent electric field produced by an electret with silicon micromachining. The micromachined LC dosimeter incorporates an array of cantilever beams deflected by the electric field produced by an electret. This array is connected to an on-chip spiral coil, thereby forming a passive LC resonant circuit. Upon exposure to the ionizing radiation, the surface charge of the electret is reduced hence decreasing the force on the cantilever beams (and therefore decreasing their deflection). This decreases the capacitance between the beams and the bottom electrode of the electret, which can be detected remotely by monitoring the resonant frequency of the LC transponder. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The ability to use wireless techniques for radiation measurement in conjunction with a miniature dosimeter will provide a valuable tool in many areas such as radiation therapy, personnel, and environmental monitoring. The out come of this research will lead to a family of cost effective, small sized wireless in-situ radiation sensors. The techniques developed during the course of this project will also have a broad impact on many applications and devices that require the integration of electrets with MEMS microstructures (e.g., electromechanical transducers, particle filters, and infrared sensors)."

The project focuses on communities where old-age care continues to be provided first and foremost by immediate family members and in particular, will investigate in detail how the same set of development forces impact rural elderly in different ways by examining the strategies that the elderly, as actors, undertake toward the goal of assuring old-age care from family members. The central hypothesis is that the elderly, as well as those who are approaching old age, do not respond homogeneously to these changes, but rather utilize different strategies of adaptation regarding intergenerational relations and old-age care systems. Understanding the social dynamics of this process will enhance existing explanatory frameworks on how rural elders and their families in the developing world deal with rapid socio-economic change. Utilizing data generated by the approaches and methods of gerontology, demography and anthropology, the project will construct a dynamic model of modernization and intergeneration relations that moves beyond the standard question of whether or not modernization negatively affects the elderly, to a more dynamic and theoretically heuristic explication of how the elderly differentially adapt to the changes wrought by development (at any stage of the process). The project employs a natural experimental research design that will study three rural areas in the Tibetan Autonomous Region in China, which differs with respect to the extent of economic development they have experienced. These three study sites possess the same language, culture, religion and social organization, and differ only in their exposure to the development transition. This design allows for research on this issue at an incipient stage of developmental, an intermediate stage, and a later stage<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The research will foster international scientific interaction between U.S. and Tibetan scholars. It will contribute to important public policy debates in the developing world and the international aid community about how to cope with the impact of socio-economic development and changes in population structure on the rural elderly and their families, in particular, the alarming evidence that the family and economic bonds that traditionally secured the elderly to families and intergenerational kin networks are weakening. By enhancing our understanding of the processes underlying how rural elderly differentially adapt, this research will assist provide policy planners to better deal with global aging in the rural third world."

This project studies: the links between mental processes and human behavior as behaviors have changed over time in response to changes in community environment. Data from a randomized housing voucher experiment known as Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is used to identify the long-term effects of changes in neighborhood environment on the behavior of low-income, mostly minority families who were originally living in high-poverty public housing projects. Random assignment of housing vouchers in MTO generates comparable groups of people living in different types of neighborhoods, which help identify the causal effects of neighborhood environments on behavior. In 2007, data on long-term outcomes (about 10 years after randomization) will be collected from 6800 youth ages 10 to 20 and from 4600 adults. Outcomes include survey data on measures of schooling, employment, risky behaviors; reading and math achievement tests; and administrative data on arrests, employment, welfare and schooling. The project aims to better understand the behavioral mechanisms behind neighborhood effects on behavior. The search for such mechanisms focuses on understanding the gender difference in youth responses to neighborhood change that were the most important scientific and policy puzzle found in the previous research, and which echoes the difference in outcomes over time in national data for African- American males and females<br/><br/> Broader Impacts. By presenting what are arguably the first credible estimates of the long-term effects of neighborhood change on low-income families, this project will provide important guidance both for housing policies that affect the geographic concentration of poverty and for community-development programs. These findings are expected to be of interest to scholars across the sciences as well as to policymakers and practitioners. The research process behind this project may also help seed new networks that bring together researchers from a broad array of disciplines. The survey data collected as part of this project will be made available through a data sharing agreement that we have established with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and should be of interest to social science, biomedical, and public health researchers."

The SSCI, modeled after the Force Concept Inventory for Newtonian mechanics, consists of 25 multiple choice questions emphasizing conceptual understanding, not rote problem solving. The incorrect answers, or distractors, capture common student misconceptions. A group of faculty member from 12 diverse institutions, referred to as the Development Team, are providing pretest and posttest SSCI scores linked to grades, gender, and race data. These data are being used to examine the construct validity of the instrument and to check for evidence of bias in the results. The Development Team is assessing the content validity of the instrument through expert peer review of the SSCI questions. A test/re-test protocol is being used to calibrate the reliability of the instrument. Student interviews are providing additional data for the validity analysis. The group is preparing a SSCI Instructor Manual that will describe which student misconceptions are captured by each distractor. This manual will also guide the interpretation of results by providing baseline data on student performance and pretest/posttest gains for the SSCI. Annual meetings of the Development Team are being used to monitor progress toward the project's objectives, each of which has been translated into a set of measurable outcomes and evaluation questions. Journal articles, conference presentations, the signals-and-systems.org website, and workshops at signal processing and engineering education conferences are being used to disseminate the SSCI and the study results."

Recent discoveries of synchrony among independent microbial communities, taxa-area relationships, and bacterial endemism call for cohesive, large-scale studies of microbial diversity in systems hosting comparable microbial communities. Freshwater bacterioplankton are particularly useful for this purpose because of their relatively restricted diversity and their global distribution. These organisms are ecologically important, catalyzing critical biogeochemical reactions and serving as central members of aquatic microbial food webs. Diversity studies, conducted mainly in lakes, indicate bacterioplankton communities are dynamic, responding to spatial and temporal environmental gradients with shifts in dominant phylotypes. In rivers, such shifts can be rapid and extreme because of short water residence time. This sensitivity makes river bacterioplankton ideal for identifying environmental controls on the composition of microbial communities. Unfortunately, very little is known about the diversity and dynamics of river bacterioplankton. This work will test for hemisphere-scale patterns of bacterial diversity by characterizing and comparing the bacterioplankton diversity of the six largest rivers in the Arctic Ocean watershed, including five of the world's largest rivers (Ob', Yenisey, Lena, Mackenzie, Yukon, and Kolyma rivers), and interpreting these patterns by relating them to an extensive complementary database of physical, chemical and biological measurements. In collaboration with the PARTNERS group (Pan-Arctic River Transport of Nutrients, Organic Matter and Suspended Sediments), and partially funded with ""start-up"" funds associated with the PI's new faculty appointment, the PI has collected high quality DNA samples from the mouths of these six rivers over a 4 years period beginning in 2003. The overall goal of the PARTNERS project is to use river water chemistry as a tool to study the origins and fates of continental runoff to the Arctic Ocean. Freshwater bacterioplankton may be useful as river-specific genetic tracers freshwater in the Arctic Ocean as they are easily distinguishable from marine bacterioplankton using molecular techniques. The principal investigator proposes to survey Arctic Rivers for abundant, persistent, river-specific bacterial phylotypes, design PCR primers targeting these organisms, and test whether these primers can detect highly dilute freshwater bacteria in the Arctic Ocean. Broader Impacts. Through collaboration with PARTNERS, this project is a multi-national endeavor (USA, Canada, & Russia) that will strengthen international communication. It will also further the knowledge of global microbial diversity, contribute to research on the long-term impacts of climate change on the Arctic, and explore the use of genetic tracers in marine systems. One graduate student will be trained in state-of-the-art molecular techniques and bioinformatics. New discoveries will be incorporated into a graduate-level course entitled Aquatic Microbial Ecology. Data, discoveries and DNA sequences will be posted on the PARTNERS project website and made available for download by the scientific community."

Application of genomics technology to environmental and ecological studies has the potential to revolutionize these fields as it has revolutionized molecular and cellular biology.  For example, one project made possible by this award is the analysis of bacterial communities in a wetland constructed for the treatment of perchloroethylene and its carcinogenic degradation product, vinyl chloride.  Characterization of bacterial community structure and succession in this wetland will help in the design of wetlands constructed for the treatment of other organic compounds.  Another project will be genomic analyses of algal blooms, which will allow for rapid discrimination between toxic and nontoxic blooms.  A third project will entail the development of high throughput methods for genetic mapping using single nucleotide polymorphisms.  The technical innovations from the acquired instrumentation will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate educational programs, including programs that target underrepresented groups.  Recent efforts in this area include funded projects for Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology (UMEB), Research in Environmental Stress for the Underrepresented, and Creating Laboratory Access for Science Students with Disabilities (CLASS).

We know more today about the function and anatomy of neural systems underlying human experience than ever. Despite these recent advances, no stable models or strategies have emerged for the study of consciousness. With funding from the National Science Foundation, two workshops will be held to bring together a diverse group of researchers to explore new approaches to the study of consciousness. The workshops are motivated by the possibility that the current impasse in consciousness studies is at least partly due to an overly narrow focus on the neural basis of consciousness, to the exclusion of perspectives made available by philosophy and other humanities disciplines. The focus on neural bases is understandable given that human and animal experience undoubtedly depends on the brain. But it is equally true that experience arises only in context - in the context of the situation of the whole animal's active engagement with its environment (including the cultural environment). Perhaps the source of our inability to bridge the gap between neural systems and consciousness is that consciousness can only be understood in its broader, contextual embedding. Perhaps consciousness only arises in context. <br/><br/>The two workshops will bring together a team of philosophers and scientists to explore strategies for understanding consciousness in context. The team will consist of researchers working in several distinct disciplines: perceptual and cognitive neuroscience, psychology (both developmental and cognitive), anthropology, evolutionary neurobiology, linguistics, and philosophy. One of the primary aims of these workshops is to lay the foundations for future collaborations on the study of consciousness in context."

The study and model development will focus on this protozoan parasite because T. gondii is the major cause of death in southern sea otters, and otters serve as a valuable sentinel for marine pollution with this important human pathogen. Focusing on two coastal sites where T. gondii infections and mortality in sea otters are prevalent, this integrated study has three components that link terrestrial ecology to land use patterns and ultimately to sea otter ecology. Investigators from University of California at Davis, California State University at Fresno, Institute of Ecosystems Study, and University of British Columbia will predict terrestrial environmental contamination with oocysts and risk of exposure to T. gondii based on the prevalence of infection in domestic felids and wild rodent populations. The investigators hypothesize that there is a distinct spatial pattern of risk for otters because land runoff forms well-defined zones at specific locations in coastal waters, and high oocyst concentrations are expected in these zones. Finally, they propose to study whether individual otter diet and movements can predict the risk of exposure and death from protozoal encephalitis caused by T. gondii infection. Data from the three components will permit evaluating the impact of alternative control strategies using simulation modeling to test whether reduction of putative risk factors will reduce site-specific incidence and prevalence of T. gondii in otters. This project is unique in its multidisciplinary and comprehensive approach - incorporating terrestrial and marine ecologists, oceanographers, epidemiologists, and parasitologists to investigate the ecology of an important environmental pathogen at the interface of terrestrial and aquatic systems. <br/><br/>In terms of the broader impacts of this study, this project emphasizes graduate student training in research and outreach. Overall, 4 Ph.D. and 2 Masters students will be mentored in research and outreach efforts. The simulation model will permit evaluation of different control strategies to reduce pathogen pollution of the near shore marine environment. This will benefit the threatened southern sea otter population that is struggling to recover, as well as other marine wildlife and humans in coastal areas. Sea otters are a flagship species with extremely high visibility, which provides a unique opportunity to inform the public about the land-sea interface and pathogen pollution. A public website www.seaotterresearch.org will be expanded to include specific information on the goals of this study and to publicize the findings in a public-friendly format with special interactive sections devoted to younger students (K-8), land and water resource managers, and cat owners. A brochure explaining risks of toxoplasmosis, suggested best practices for cat owners, and methods to reduce environmental exposure to T. gondii will be provided to the cat-owning public through pet product retailers and veterinarians in coastal areas. Sea otter bookmarks with the web address will also be provided at no cost through pet product retailers and schools in the high impact areas. Public town hall meetings will be organized and attended by senior personnel and students at both study sites to inform and discuss with local residents the rationale, design and findings of the study. Each of the graduate students involved in the project will be trained in public relations/speaking and will be required to make at least 2 presentations per year at schools and public meetings in high-risk communities. In addition, to original research publications, students will present the results of this research at national scientific conferences."

(ii) which imaging algorithms are capable of processing the received signals and produce reconstructed images in realistic time frame? The investigators are proposing to build an advanced ultra wideband compact imaging sensor that is specifically designed for breast cancer imaging. This sensor will be an antenna array composed of dielectric wideband elements. Each element will be a dielectric resonator antenna that can be flexible in shape, small in size and light in weight, making the sensor practical for use on the breast. Also, the investigators are proposing to develop and hybridize potential imaging algorithms to efficiently and rapidly reconstruct the tumor shape and location using received signals. The intellectual merits of this proposal focus on designing and building an advanced compact ultra wideband lightweight microwave sensor; developing efficient and robust imaging algorithms to be integrated with the hardware part of the system; and validating the developed algorithms on real data to be collected by the sensors. The proposed hardware sensor will be used to validate the imaging algorithm and once proven successful the investigators will seek funding in collaboration with medical researchers for clinical use. <br/>The broader impact of this project will be on women's health in general and on breast cancer disease in particular. The new system will offer an economical and less painful option for many women.

The frustules of growing diatoms and their organic template record the environmental conditions in which they grow. Once frustules sink and become sediment, paleoceanographers are able to use their chemical and isotopic composition to study past nutrient utilization (15N/14N ratio) and productivity (13C/12C ratio), as well as determine the radiocarbon age of sedimentary frustules. Currently, sedimentary frustules are physically isolated and chemically cleaned prior to the analysis of the elemental and isotopic composition of bulk organic matter associated with the frustules. Unfortunately, the records that have been through these prevailing methods have lead to ambiguous reconstructions of past oceanographic environments. <br/><br/>For this reason, researchers at the University of Washington and Oregon State University will develop several new, more reliable methods for analyzing the molecular and isotopic signatures of organic matter associated with diatom frustules. Specifically, the team of scientists will characterize the organic matter in diatoms frustules from cultures, plankton tows and sediments by using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The influence of frustule-cleaning and partial dissolution on frustule-bound organic compounds and the absolute relative abundance of biomarkers in frustules under iron limited and iron replete conditions will also be examined. In addition, the team of researchers will also purify individual frustule-bound biomarkers. By improving the methods for analyzing the molecular and isotopic signature of organic matter associated with diatom frustules, the dating of diatom-rich samples of Holocene age will be more accurate, the core integrity will be properly assessed, and the methods for measuring 13C/12C, 15N/14N and C/N ratios in diatom frustules will be improved. <br/><br/>As regards broader impacts, the work will not only open up entirely new avenues in paleoceanography, but also lead to a better understanding of past climate conditions and the ocean's biogeochemical cycles response to future anthropogenic impacts. The project will also provide for the support and training of one female graduate student and one or two undergraduate students."

Modern geoscience research in igneous & metamorphic petrology, weathering & surface processes, and oceanography & paleoclimate - all research strengths of the four PIs - often requires the reconstruction of past geologic events or conditions with fine geochemical and geochronological spatial and temporal resolution only possible by pushing the limits of precision and sample size with the TIMS. The new BU TIMS/MicroMill Facility will be dedicated to pushing those limits. This open regional TIMS Facility will serve the research needs of the four PI's on this proposal, others in the Department and University, and other geoscientists in the region. Our external user management plan providing training for long-term student users, encouraging collaborative research with BU PI's particularly where specialized analysis is needed, and including an appropriate recharge rate, will ensure the integrity of the lab facilities while always providing the best quality isotopic data to BU and external users. The Facility will benefit a wide spectrum of graduate and undergraduate research at BU and in the region."

This project links seven institutions in four countries: Michigan State University, Duke University, Centre Europeen de Recherche et d'Enseignement des Geosciences de l'Environnement [(CEREGE), France], National Polytechnical Institute & National Institute for Applied Sciences [France], National University Kyiv-Mohyla Academy [Ukraine], Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology [Russia] and Volgograd State University of Architecture & Civil Engineering [Russia]. Membrane processing of water is a dynamic and critical area of research and one that has historically been international in scope. The project will address the issue of drinking water safety with two primary research thrusts. First, they will focus on three aspects of nanomaterial-enabling membrane technology, i.e., nanomaterial composites for improved polymeric membranes, nanomaterial-derived ceramic membranes, and low fouling membrane-supported nanoparticle sensors for water quality control. The second research thrust will address two aspects of membrane fouling, regeneration of polyelectrolyte membrane coatings, and hybrid ozonation-ultrafiltration pretreatment system for cost-effective reverse osmosis desalination of brackish surface waters. The research is organized in international teams of faculty and students. The student involvement in the teams will take various forms: 1) each U.S. graduate student is teamed with at least one foreign doctoral student, both of whom are co-advised by U.S. and foreign scientists; 2) over the course of their graduate career, each U.S. graduate student is expected to work in at least two foreign countries; 3) U.S. undergraduates will work in a partnering Russian lab after completing a semester of study abroad in Russia; 4) U. S. high school students will work in a U.S. lab on the international collaborative projects. The international teams of faculty will provide input for new U.S.-based courses and will participate in seminar programs at Rice University and Michigan State University, thus providing a more international curriculum both for students in the program, as well as for student who do not travel overseas.<br/>The results of this project in environmental engineering are likely to produce a substantial advance in our understanding of water treatment membranes and so should have substantial societal benefit. This project also fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Europe/Eurasia to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit."

The existing observational array will be augmented with an assortment of sensors designed to measure fluid forces and physical and geochemical responses near, at, and below the seabed. Some sensors represent existing technology, some represent relatively new technology in development, and others will be developed, tested, and deployed as part of this project (subseabed thermistor and redox sensor arrays, benthic chlorophyll fluorescence imaging). Present instrumentation includes meteorological packages, ADCPs, surface and bottom CTDs, fluorometers and PAR sensors. The observatory instrumentation will be used to characterize the seabed response to physical forces acting across a spectrum of time scales. The frequency, intensity, and timing of energetic events will be detected within the water column, and their manifestation within the BBL will be followed. BBL instrumentation will measure thresholds of bed motion and characterize near-bed suspended loads, and will be used to estimate pressure fields and advective fluxes at the interface. In situ geochemical sensors will be used to characterize rates of advection of properties within the sediment and connect those properties to both physical forcing above the interface and biological forcing driven by seasonal and diurnal cues. The combination of instrumentation and observational strategies will produce a holistic portrait of the causes and consequences of benthic exchange processes in permeable sediments."

Nevertheless, a type of myosin, called nuclear myosin I, has been identified in the nucleus. Actin is also abundant in the nucleus. Importantly, it has been established that actin and nuclear myosin I are important in transcription. However, the details of how these proteins are involved in transcription are not known. Therefore, this project will investigate the proposition that actin is involved in multiple stages of transcription. There are two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will investigate how actin is involved in pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation. PIC formation is the first step in transcription and involves the association of a host of proteins at the promoter region of a gene. Although actin is necessary for PIC formation, when and how it is recruited to the developing PIC, what proteins it associates with and whether it has an enzymatic or structural function in the PIC is not known. These questions are the subject of specific aim 1. Specific aim 2 will investigate the form of actin that is involved in transcription. Actin can exist as a monomer or it can polymerize to form long filaments (F-actin). F-actin is the form of actin involved in muscle contraction. However, actin filaments have never been demonstrated in the nucleus. Therefore, a central question regarding actin in the nucleus is whether nuclear processes require monomeric or filamentous actin. This question will be addressed in specific aim 2. Data from these could potentially change our understanding of transcription, a process that is fundamental to life as we know it. In addition, this research will contribute to the education of American and international undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. It will also promote collaborations with American and European investigators. <br/>This project is co-funded through Genes and Genome Systems and Cellular Systems."

CAPA (Computer Assisted Personalized Approach) is a type of course management system developed in the early 1990s and now used in a number of universities. LON (Learning Online Network) is a new technology designed to work with CAPA to create an integrated system for online learning and assessment. LON CAPA consists of a learning content authoring and management system allowing new and existing content to be used flexibly, a course management system, an individualized homework and automatic grading system, data collection and data mining system, and a content delivery system. This collaborative project is adapting this new system to the teaching of statistical methods in the social sciences. CAPA has been used for several years for this purpose. The new LON CAPA system is expected to be more flexible and better suited to connecting departments with common interests to share learning materials and assessment results. The new system allows more personalized attention to the learning problems of individual students. It can more effectively connect students to resources that they can use to overcome learning barriers in undergraduate statistics. We are translating the existing statistics problem library of over 600 problems from CAPA into LON CAPA format. We are also creating multimedia class material designed to help students learn the concepts underlying the assigned problems, and this material is being woven into their homework assignments. After implementing the LON-CAPA system in the fall semester of 2003 and refining our materials, we plan to collect student performance data during spring and fall of 2004. These data will be used to test the greater efficacy of LON CAPA relative to CAPA. An extensive database of student performance information already exists for the statistics material from courses in statistics for the social sciences that have been using CAPA. Equivalence in examination content can be maintained after the LON CAPA system is in place, making a direct test of whether students have benefited from the adapted materials possible."

This innovation will be timely and useful in that it coincides with recent improvements in study design and data collection methodologies that have led to increased availability of and interest in longitudinal data among social, behavioral, and economic researchers. The methodology will be motivated by a diverse range of applications that include studies of crop diversification of tobacco farmers, suicidal behavior of adolescents, and emotional changes monitored through ""Experience Sampling Methods,"" among others. The methodology will be called Temporal Configuration Analysis (TCA) so as to emphasize the focus on detection and identification of meaningful patterns in individual behavior trajectories over time. The key element in TCA will be a dynamic model that tracks the transition of ""latent states"" from one time point to another for each individual. Latent states (e.g., health state, psychological state, political inclination) can be viewed as summary measures of observed variables that translate to or condition manifested behavior. TCA will allow a researcher to identify homogeneous subgroups of individuals in terms of their temporal trajectories of latent states and then to examine the profile of each subgroup. Accordingly, a researcher will be able to interpret the results from analysis of multi-wave data in terms of both observed and latent measures and their trajectories. This will provide additional behavioral meaning and insight. TCA will also feature a broad range of component statistical models to provide users with flexibility in handling commonly encountered data characteristics, such as cross-sectional dependence, state-dependence, and serial correlation. TCA will create a statistical framework for analyzing multi-wave data in which inter-temporal qualitative information is of interest.<br/><br/>The project will have immediate, broad, and significant impact on the social, behavioral, and economic sciences and statistical research. First, researchers will be able to analyze multi-wave data in a new way that is different from and more informative than traditional methods such as latent growth curve analysis. For example, it will be possible to describe and visualize behavioral responses by projecting these configurations onto the space of actual behavior. Second, the project will contribute to the science of statistics, specifically in the area of hidden Markov models (HMM). The investigators expect that once this method is developed, explicated, and applied, statisticians and mathematical scientists will expand the TCA framework to include additional innovative research applications. The project's impact will be broadened and maximized in several ways: (1) dissemination of accessible, user-friendly, high-quality software that will document the TCA methodology and allow researchers to use it easily; (2) integration of research and education at several levels-grades 10-12, undergraduate, and graduate; and (3) interaction between the team of applied and theoretical investigators and various research groups, both nationally and internationally, with emphasis on publishing applied research findings. The project will deliver Web-based end-products-high-quality programs in packages familiar to social, behavioral, and economic researchers. The investigators will collaborate with the Center of Excellence in Research, Teaching, and Learning (CERTL) at Wake Forest University, using its infrastructure and experience in training American students in science and engineering, to integrate research into education. The project team, which includes national and international researchers from several disciplines, will leverage this collaboration to increase both the impact and visibility of the project through extensive coordination with various national and international research groups. This award was supported as part of the fiscal year 2005 Mathematical Sciences priority area special competition on Mathematical Social and Behavioral Sciences (MSBS)."

The PIs will to transform the existing SSDP from a case-level database to an individual-level (justice-level) database. Specifically, the PIs will transform, check, describe, and archive the individual-level state supreme court judge data. Given both the importance of the SSDP as well as its frequency of use, supplementing the SSDP with an individual-level database is something that will be widely utilized by scholars of the judiciary."

The investigator will triangulate data collected using different, rigorous methodologies to address the research question. To assess how information on financialties and research is presented to the lay public, the team will: conduct a content and frames analysis of lay press coverage (1999-2004) of researchers' financial ties to industry, and interview journalists who report on scientific research to assess their perspectives on researchers' financial ties. The principal investigator is one of the leading researchers in the area of conflicts of interest and research. Her previous work found that the most frequent way that research institutions deal with financial conflicts of interest is to require disclosure of financial ties in scientific publications and public presentations. There are strong opinions both for and against the appropriateness of disclosure as a strategy for managing financial conflicts of interest. However, there is little empirical evidence about the effect of financial disclosures on the research enterprise or what disclosure means to the public. Public attitudes are ultimately responsible for maintaining public financial support of and participation in research. Thus, the proposed examination studies one aspect of the interaction of science and society. The findings will evaluate the potential effects of financial ties of researchers on the public's trust and investment in research. Growing private investment in science and the personal financial ties of scientists with research sponsors raise ethical questions about the appropriateness of such ties. Thus, this proposal will gather data to address some fundamental questions about the disclosure of financial ties and research: How is information on the financial ties of researchers presented to the lay public? Are the disclosures framed in a way that could affect public trust in and support of scientific research? The findings will provide new information on whether the existence or disclosure of financial ties of investigators has potentially beneficial or adverse effects on the research enterprise. The project will gauge the value of public disclosure as a means of addressing researcher conflicts of interest. This information will have significant impact on the methods commonly used to manage financial conflicts of interest relating to research in government and academia. It will guide research institutions in making decisions about how to manage conflicts of interest in ways that will foster public trust in research, as well as collaboration among public and private partners. The investigators will disseminate their findings in the peer reviewed scientific literature, the lay media, and directly to policy makers who are concerned about conflicts of interest in science. Other venues for disseminating the results include the American Public Health Association meeting, which serves a wide audience. For example, the Principal Investigator has presented previously in the environmental science section, law and ethics section, media studies section, and tobacco, alcohol and other drugs section. Other possible venues for dissemination are the Center for Science in the Public Interest meetings and Sequestered Science meetings."

In order to accurately assess these processes, studies require accurate estimates of the air-water CO2 flux. Currently, these efforts are seriously undermined by an inability to satisfactorily model the factors governing air-water gas transfer in physically complex coastal systems.<br/><br/>In this study, researchers at the University of Columbia and Yale University will: (i) determine the spatial and temporal variability of turbulence that governs air-water CO2 exchange in coastal systems; (ii) measure the processes controlling the air-water CO2 exchange rate in river/estuarine systems, and resolve the relative importance that wind, tides, stratification, and bathymetry play in generating near surface turbulence in various estuarine systems; (iii) directly compare the gradient flux and the floating dome techniques; and (iv) determine the relative importance of the air-water CO2 flux versus other terms in the carbon budget in coastal systems. Field experiments will be conducted in the Hudson River estuary (large tidal river system), the Parker River estuary (smaller macro-tidal river system), and the Long Island Sound (semi-enclosed coastal sea) to study systems with a range of biogeochemical and physical forcing. Measurements of air-water flux of CO2 using the gradient flux and floating dome techniques will be used to determine the gas transfer velocity in these systems. Simultaneously, turbulence at the water surface (e.g., turbulent kinetic energy dissipation) and physical forcing responsible for generating near surface turbulence (e.g., wind speed, tidal currents, stratification, bathymetry) will be quantified. The goal is to understand the processes controlling the CO2 flux in these three distinct coastal systems, so that the amount of CO2 exchange to the atmosphere in a wide range of other coastal systems and the ocean can be predicted. Because this study relates directly to the cycles of any element with a gaseous phase, including many biogenic gases and industrial pollutants such as N2O, PCBs, Hg0 (g), and PAHs, the results from the project will reduce the large errors in gas exchange estimation. This will allow the dominant pathways of harmful volatile pollutants to be assessed more carefully. The project will provide support and training for graduate and undergraduate students, and include the participation of k-12 science teachers. The results will be available to the public through a number of educational programs."

Electrical power grid outages<br/>occurred over a large area, but most significantly in critical locations such as hospitals, public<br/>works departments, and cellular towers. Emergency power generators at such locations were less<br/>than effective as a result of flooding, failure to start, and limited fuel supply. The<br/>telecommunication and power systems are needed most when a disaster such as Hurricane<br/>Katrina occurs, but it is this very environment that caused the systems to fail.<br/>Broader Impact:<br/>We propose to study the infrastructure and procedural failure modes that caused the New Orleans<br/>area emergency telecommunication network and power system to become ineffective and fail.<br/>We plan to work with state agencies (State Police, Office of Emergency Preparedness -OEP),<br/>and appropriate public and private local agencies to assess the status and shortcomings of the<br/>existing systems."

Today traffic flows continue to rapidly outpace resources available to society for improving the transportation infrastructure, and better management of existing facilities would be a cost effective way for resolving the problem. Since congestion depends on the policies chosen by the traffic authorities, and on the social interaction of individuals as drivers and passengers, analyzing congestion requires an integrated approach that allows for different viewpoints: the transportation agencies', the consumers', as well as the perspective of society as a whole. The primary objective of this research is to find an optimal mix of strategies that will spread traffic congestion over geographical space and time by better utilization of current resources, thereby reducing its costs. These strategies, such as dynamic pricing or highway reservation methods, have either been implemented in few selected areas in the United States, or have been discussed conceptually; however, their effects on travel and the urban infrastructure are not well understood. We propose to bring together tools from economics, systems engineering, and transportation engineering for a comprehensive analysis of the congestion problem. A number of concurrent objectives will be pursued in this research, which involves artificial intelligence models of users' transportation services, a set of economic experiments to evaluate different transportation policies, a model of the interaction of social networks and transportation choices, and a system dynamics analysis of transportation and social networks and their dynamic evolution. The successful completion of this research will have the potential to lead to new paradigms of traffic analysis and to a new understanding of the linkages between transportation, the urban infrastructure and ultimately the regional economy."

Long-term interactions among social and ecological processes give rise to complex dynamics on multiple temporal and spatial scales -- cycles of change followed by relative stasis and then a new cycle of change. Within the cycles are understandable patterns and irreducible uncertainties. Neither stability nor transformation can be taken as the norm. Although these cycles can be identified, it remains uncertain what fosters stability or contributes to transformation over long cycles. What vulnerabilities can be tolerated, and which tip a system into transformation and at what scale? Resilience theorists have built an understanding of social and ecological vulnerabilities, stability, and transformation based on studies of contemporary socioecological systems. This interdisciplinary research project will examine some of these understandings by applying archaeological and ecological analyses and formal dynamical modeling. The project will be undertaken by a collaboration of archaeologists, mathematical modelers, ecologists, and environmental scientists. Archaeology is attuned to cycles of change over the lifespan of a society -- heightened inter-societal interaction, economic intensification, and large-scale anthropogenic environmental change . It therefore extends scientific observation of stability and transformation beyond all social memory. Archaeologically documented case studies in the American Southwest and Northern Mexico provide the information for investigating long-term human-environmental interactions. The project will (1) compile documentation on up to four archaeological cases, (2) examine their pan-regional connections, and (3) employ mathematical modeling and subsequent archaeological and ecological analysis to abstract the key variables and processes underlying periods of cultural stability and both rapid and protracted transformations. The empirical investigations provide substantive contexts for the models, while the models will foster insight into generalizations that are then examined in empirical contexts. This iterative process is expected to lead to insights that could not be derived from any single approach, nor can they be derived from the short time span available in contemporary study of social or ecological change.<br/><br/>This project will influence the refinement of theory and understanding of processes of socioecological change. First, an intensive collaboration of archaeologists specializing in the American Southwest and Northern Mexico will contribute a new level of understanding of the social and environmental interactions underlying important episodes in human history. Second, through archaeology's deep time perspective, this project will examine the utility of resilience theory as applied to coupled socioecological systems, demonstrate the value of archaeology to ecological theory, and further scientific understanding of current socioecological problems through refinement of concepts and theory. Third, this project will identify the dynamics of transformation and stability as conditioned by cultural and environmental contexts, strategies for coping with uncertainty, and varying constraints of long-term legacies. This project is expected to promote awareness of some of the human strategies for dealing with uncertainty and change as well as awareness of how human actions leave legacies of resilience or degradation. In addition, this project will immerse students in an interdisciplinary research community that will spark development of professional skills and encourage them to exchange knowledge about coupled human and environmental systems. The involvement of students and researchers from the U.S., Mexico, France, and the many nations represented in the Resilience Alliance will foster global perspectives and international collaborations. This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems."

Whether presence of one parasite is beneficial or detrimental to another is a crucial, but as yet overlooked, factor in disease control and dynamics. This project will investigate how a community of parasites is shaped at the individual level and the consequences this has for disease dynamics at the population level using a mixture of experiments and mathematical modeling.<br/><br/>Not all individuals are equal; they differ in their ability to fight and spread infections. Importantly this can give rise to certain individuals being accountable for the majority of disease transmission; super-spreaders. These super-spreaders may have predictable characteristics that allow for thier identification and so target disease control most effectively. However, the mechanisms that create super-spreaders thus far have been elusive. <br/><br/>We explore the idea that a super-spreader may be a function of the parasites it harbors and the interactions that occur between them. As such we will tease apart the inherent differences between individuals that lead to changes in susceptibility and exposure to parasites whilst also determining how infection mediated through an individual's immune system will shape the parasite community. These interactions will be investigated in a seasonal environment since the availability of parasitic infective stages and therefore the community structure may be a function of the highly variable development and survival rates of different parasites at different temperatures. <br/><br/>Insights gained from this project on the mechanisms that determine parasite community dynamics should help researchers indentify important factors in disease emergence, determine why some parasites may be more prevalent than others, and identify the characteristics that create super-spreaders. The project will use a mouse-human pathogen system to infer disease dynamics at the human-pathogen level. The program will support training of post-doc, graduate and undergraduate students."

A global system of human capital development, composed of more closely coupled elements and more complex interactions is developing. No longer are ""flows"" unidirectional, with human capital flowing to the U.S. and advanced innovation emanating almost exclusively from the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Instead, new patterns of S&E human capital flows and location of S&E activities are challenging the longstanding patterns that gave these nations a predominant position. Growth of the U.S. S&E workforce, and the country's high levels of innovation, have long benefited from in-flows of highly talented people from newly industrializing economies. These inflows were attracted by the location of much of the world's leading-edge science and engineering in firms and universities in the United States. There are signs that this U.S. advantage is declining. Emerging patterns of immigration and easing geographic constraints on the location of S&E work are evoking concern about the ability of the U.S. to maintain a leading S&E workforce, and thus to maintain its current leadership in science and engineering. S&E workforce development and leading-edge science and engineering are now shaped by a global system of firms, governments, and educational institutions that, in turn, shape the decision making of individual actors, the educational administrators, workers, and students themselves. <br/><br/>A cross-disciplinary team of organizational, engineering, business, education policy, immigration and population, and labor market researchers will examine this emerging global system. This project is composed of three components. The first component extends the project team's current research on the transfer of high level engineering work by U.S., European, and Japanese multinationals to emerging economies. In building on this research, the PIs examine the impact of knowledge work globalization on U.S. corporate strategies and on investment in human capital development. This includes the impact of changes in the location of knowledge work on university/industry collaborations and work force development systems. The second component is an industry/occupation analysis of immigrant flows in the science and engineering workforce as well as national employment and wage trends for S&E workers, building on a detailed analysis of U.S. and international data sources. A key question is how the globalization of S&E work is affecting the demand for, and supply of S&E trained workers. The third component focuses on university enrollment trends and recruitment strategies in graduate science and engineering fields, building on work on the participation of underrepresented groups in the science and engineering pipeline and workforce. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The projects contribute to the development of a framework of global human capital development that includes migration flows and education systems, with a specific focus on knowledge workers and the location of S&E activities. The project addresses social issues of longstanding concern to the scientific community and of society in general by examining the conditions, policies, and practices in the development of the science and engineering workforces, policies, and practices that could increase the numbers of underrepresented populations in the science and engineering fields, and education and human resource policies. The study also places in a broader, more global framework, the recent declines in foreign student enrollments in U.S. S&E graduate programs."

This new disease has the potential to profoundly affect local vertebrate populations. Vertebrate populations (e.g., mice, squirrels, lizards), in turn, strongly influence risk of human exposure to Lyme disease (LD) via their impacts on numbers and infection of tick vectors. This research will integrate field, laboratory, and modeling efforts. First, a combination of field and lab studies will furnish information on individual host species' contributions to LD risk in California. Second, the abundance of specific groups of vertebrates will be compared in sites of high versus low SOD impact. Third, responses by specific hosts to SOD will be used to construct models to predict how SOD will change risk of human exposure to LD. Fourth, specific hypotheses arising from these models will be tested by assessing tick abundance and infection prevalence in areas of high and low SOD impact.<br/><br/>Our research embeds the ecology of the most prevalent vector-borne disease of humans in the United States (LD) within the ecology of a devastating infectious disease of plants (SOD), and specifically asks how these two disease systems interact. The outbreak of SOD presents a novel opportunity to determine how a human infectious disease is impacted by an exotic forest pathogen. Such research provides a model for current epidemics of plant pathogens and pests (e.g., beech bark disease, hemlock woolly adelgid, gypsy moth) that in all likelihood will dramatically change the composition of North American forests, with potentially strong consequences for human health."

However, the application of superficial rare earth oxide coatings might provide a particular solution to the problem. The research would allow us to develop vacancy engineered cerium oxide coatings for high temperature protection of steel substrates. The main objectives of the proposal are: (1) Preparation of cerium oxides, (2) Compare the effectiveness of nanocrystalline ceria and titania to compare the effect of mixed valence states in the oxidation kinetics, (3) Prepare and study the effect of La and Nd doped ceria as a function of oxygen vacancy concentration on the efficacy of the high temperature protection, (4) Explain the oxidation kinetics as a function of vacancy concentration in the formation of early chromia healing layer.<br/><br/>A more fundamental understanding of the true nature of cerium oxide with or without doping will be investigated. Comparative studies of two mixed valence states materials (cerium oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles) on the protective nature of the steel from high temperature oxidation will be conducted as part of this program. This basic consideration and study of these rare earth coatings will also lead to the understanding of the oxidation kinetics as a function of oxygen vacancies and mixed valence states. Thus, these results will lead to the design of better and cost effective oxidation resistant coatings for steel materials."

The award called for the northern portion of the Juan De Fuca Plate to be outfitted with a network of submarine electro-optical cables to serve a set of scientific primary and secondary nodes. These nodes will provide a unique electrical power and bandwidth infrastructure to the open ocean environment (seafloor, sub seafloor and overlying ocean) for the pursuit of next generation science inquiries into the dynamic behavior of all systems of interest. The PIs propose to complete the route surveys for laying of the Neptune cable. The laying of this cable will be especially challenging because one of the primary target areas for science node emplacement is a volcanically active submarine spreading center that will be the focus of the research empowered by the cabled observatory node. This will be the first ever deployment of such a system and it is crucial that the best possible information be obtained to confidently lay the main cable to the primary node site and secondary cables to outlier instruments like seismometers.<br/><br/>Opportunities and Issues<br/>In September of 2005, the UW Hydrothermal Research Group (Delaney and Kelley, PI's) will be conducting a multiply-funded, 34-day research cruise in the volcanically active area selected by NEPTUNE Canada as a high priority node location of the Stage 1 Regional Cable Observatory (RCO) Implementation effort. The Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge is the locus of considerable interest for many scientific groups including the NSF RIDGE2K Program, the Keck Foundation Research effort of the UW Group, and the Canadian NEPTUNE Planning efforts. But the active ridge-crest represents a uniquely hazardous environment for cable laying. As part of the research effort this September, the R/V T. G. Thompson will be deployed to the area for more than a month with the ROV Jason on board as the principal deep submergence asset. With the appropriate support, the Autonomous Benthic Explorer (ABE), a proven, programmable, untethered deep-sea mapping vehicle could be used on board in parallel operations with Jason so that the two assets operate in a mostly simultaneous mode to accomplish both the scheduled science activities and the requisite cable survey.<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>This work is taking advantage of a unique opportunity to complete the seafloor mapping required prior to the laying of the NEPTUNE cable at Endeavour Ridge. This seafloor observing site will enable real-time data streams and interactive experiments to be placed in one of the most biologically and geologically important sites in the ocean. The cruise on which this mapping will occur is the target of intense public outreach and as such, the data collection and ABE itself will enable the details of this important section of ocean floor to be seen by many."

The resulting activities are attracting qualified Appalachian high school students, particularly women and underrepresented minorities, to engineering and science-oriented programs, retaining them during their first year in engineering, and encouraging the improvement in math scores for all students. The first strategy trains 25 teachers per year with a set of teaching tools, referred to as TIME (Tools for Integrating Math and Engineering) kits, ultimately reaching 125 teachers who will impact 12,500 students annually. Developed by West Virginia University faculty from engineering, mathematics, math education, and physics, working with master mathematics teachers, the TIME kits are authentic problem-based engineering lessons designed to increase student achievement in math and interest in science and engineering. Math concepts are tied to the curriculum requirements of the West Virginia Department of Education Content Standards and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards. The second strategy is a summer experience program designed to encourage minority and female students to participate in a science or engineering field and to mentor students without a support system at home. This program provides intensive instruction for 80 -100 underrepresented minority students and women each year. Students attend in cohort groups of 20 for one week and maintain contact with the program during the subsequent academic year through engineering student mentors. The curriculum consists of introductory engineering training; basic math, science and technology skills; ACT/SAT preparation; and study skills necessary to survive on a large college campus. The third strategy, an on-line, college-credit course for high school students, is drawn from the existing first-year curricula. This course provides capable high school students a chance to better understand engineering career options before entering a college program and gain college credit that will reduce the time needed to complete their degree. The fourth strategy is a first-year engineering retention program that emphasizes mentorship and coaching. The investigators anticipate that engineering enrollment and graduation will grow by four percent annually during the five-year grant period, with improvements expected in all STEM programs. Dissemination is being achieved through presentations at professional education and engineering education meetings and by publications in professional journals."

The collection of sequences from each clone will be compared to all other clones to identify sequences in common and thus clone overlaps. The length of the sequences generated should be sufficient to enable unique assignments in non-repetitive overlaps. Within duplicated and repetitive regions small sequence variations will be used to identify precise map locations. This new method will be developed and validated using clones from the soybean genome physical map.<br/><br/>This mapping method has the potential to greatly impact the physical mapping and genomics community, especially in plants. There are many complex genomes yet to be characterized in any detail. These genomes will benefit from new sequencing methods but as the disruptive technologies on the sequencing horizon are focusing on high-throughput generation of inexpensive short reads, comprehensive physical maps will be essential to assemble these reads correctly into long stretches of contiguous sequence. In addition, the distributed sequence sampling that accompanies this map generation method may in itself constitute an affordable whole genome project.<br/><br/>The project will afford opportunities for student involvement in both software and protocol development.

In particular, research focused on the mechanisms leading to lake-effect convective boundary layer growth and mesoscale circulations, and how they differ from oceanic marine boundary layers, has helped stimulate these improvements. In addition, results and tools from these earlier research studies have allowed for initial investigations of complex processes associated with ""non-classic"" lake-effect storms, where lake effect systems are modified by synoptic or sub-synoptic phenomena or upwind air masses are modified by neighboring lakes. As a result of prior NSF supported research, the Principal Investigators reported on investigations of several non-classic lake-effect systems including (1) enhanced snowfall caused by seeding of lake-effect clouds by higher level cloud layers, (2) convective cloud bands that develop over a lake and extend across an intervening land mass to a second downwind lake, and (3) synoptic frontal modifications resulting from the interaction with a large mid-latitude lake. <br/><br/>This research project seeks to build on past research results and address unanswered scientific questions using new observations and numerical models to broaden understanding of non-classic lake-effect systems and environments. Specific research objectives are to: (1) use unique observations from the Great Lakes Ice Cover-Atmospheric Flux (GLICAF) project to understand and quantify the relationship of surface fluxes to heterogeneous pack ice concentrations, (2) use case-study, climatic, and numerical model simulations to understand the structure of multiple-lake bands and the influence of environmental parameters on their development and evolution, (3) quantify the influence of environmental conditions on cold frontal structure and evolution as synoptic fronts interact with lake-effect systems, (4) use Doppler radar measurements, accompanied by atmospheric and environmental datasets to determine the favorable conditions and the organization of mesoscale snow events associated with lake-effect systems over small mid-latitude lakes, and (5) examine cloud and ice spectrum characteristics, as well as radiative flux profiles, across a range of lake-effect systems. <br/><br/>Results of this research will give valuable insight into complex processes that often complicate winter forecasting of mesoscale phenomena common to the Great Lakes region. These results will be communicated to the meteorological community through journal and conference articles and to the operational community through regional workshops and presentations at National Weather Service offices."

The US organizers are Dr. Unil Perera, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State University (GSU), Athens and Dr. Kirti Tennakone, Director, Institute of Fundamental Studies (IFS), Kandy, Sri Lanka.<br/><br/>This workshop is planned to encourage students, post-doctoral associates, and senior researchers to engage in scientific discussions related to developing infrared detectors. The focus will be on intersubband transitions, specifically quantum well (QWIP) and quantum dot infrared photodetector (QDIP) structures. A second aim is to encourage scientists and students from the south Asian region to be involved in these novel developments. This would initiate new collaborations and enhance ongoing collaborations there by providing a better prepared graduate student pool for the US higher education institutions. Following rapid developments in the past 15 years, QWIP has become a technology for infrared imaging. Despite this rapid advance, some areas are not yet completely resolved and potentials are not fully exploited. Several world experts in the QWIP/QDIP research & development, government sponsors, industrial engineers, instrument technologists and end users will meet to discuss the current issues, formulate future directions, and propose collaborations. This effort could resolve some basic scientific issues not yet addressed such as low background operation and also could lead to the development of new types of nanostructure sensors. New materials form another focal point including quantum dots (e.g., QDIPs) and novel materials systems (e.g., Indium Arsenate/Gallium Antimonide/Aluminum Antimonide (InAs/GaSb/AlSb), Gallium Indium Nitride (InGaN) Quantum Wells (QWs), and dilute nitride InGaNAs QWs) will also be discussed.<br/><br/>Since QWIP technology is a critical emerging technology that can impact on the US strengths in infrared detection, this workshop is designed to keep the U.S. scientists abreast of its latest developments around the globe. This project will support participation by 3 junior scientists, 12 graduate students and 2 undergraduate students, all in U.S. institutions. Nano-structures and novel materials are of widespread interest to the solid-state physics and engineering community, with possibility for the development of new advanced materials. Recent advances in terahertz detection using quantum well and dot structures would be another area of interest. The workshop will generate communications, mutual understanding and collaborations between U.S. scientists and students and those in foreign countries, especially within the Asian region. In addition the QWIP device knowledge among US students and young scientists will also be broadened especially among minority and women. This training of the next generation of high technology workforce will be critical in maintaining US strengths in novel nanotechnology focus areas. Current GSU-IFS collaborations will be extended to the QWIP device area and support will be provided for exchange visits between the two research laboratories."

However, the two fields share a common goal of trying to understand how anthropogenic chemicals affect species and communities via direct and indirect food web effects. This common goal is especially strong for understanding how chemical stressors affect amphibian assemblages because of current conservation concerns over their global decline. Past studies of stress on amphibians have focused largely on the effects on single species under laboratory conditions. While this work has provided a great deal of excellent data, we ultimately wish to know what happens under more natural conditions. This proposal addresses these needs by using a series of field experiments that examine seven species of amphibians and common environmental stressor that are associated with amphibian declines. The work will focus on understanding how predators, and competitors interact with natural and anthropogenic stressors to affect aquatic communities. The broader impacts consist of training of graduate and undergraduate students (including under-represented groups). The benefits to society include a better understanding of how human stressors affect natural communities and global amphibian declines. Our results will be disseminated by the PI and students in journals, conferences, and the popular press. The experimental results will be developed into teaching modules for regional middle and high school teachers. Collectively, this research offers a great opportunity to advance our basic understanding of ecological systems and have a strong, positive impact on society."

The mission of the American National Election<br/>Studies (ANES) is to inform explanations of election outcomes by providing data that support rich<br/>hypothesis testing, maximize methodological excellence, measure many variables, and promote<br/>comparisons across people, contexts, and time. The ANES serves this mission by providing researchers with a view of the political world through the eyes of ordinary citizens. Such data are critical, because these citizens' actions determine election outcomes. <br/><br/>This research continues the ANES mission for the next four years, but in new and better ways<br/>than ever before. It builds on an ANES history that has made the project a valuable resource to<br/>generations of social scientists. As has been true for every past presidential election in the ANES time<br/>series, a presidential year pre- and post-election study will be conducted using face-to-face interviewing of a nationally representative sample of adults, with an unusually high response rate. This study will include questions specific to the election of 2008 and also questions that augment the ANES time series, which is now in its sixth decade. For the first time, moreover, scholars will be able to purchase interview minutes and additional cases on the time series study to enhance its breadth.<br/><br/>In many other respects, this proposal constitutes a substantial break from the past, outlining new kinds of data collection, new methods for choosing questionnaire items, a new management structure, new organizational procedures to promote the involvement of a broader set of scholars, and a fundamentally different kind of relationship between the ANES and its user community.<br/>One new data collection effort will be a two-year panel study involving six core waves of data<br/>collection with the same respondents, plus 15 additional waves of data collection. The first core wave will be in late 2007, before the primaries; the next three core waves will be spread over the months running up to election day; and the final core waves will be in November and May after the election. Data will also be collected during every other month throughout the life of the panel, but with a focus on matters that are not explicitly political, to minimize selective panel attrition or conditioning driven by interest in politics while producing lots of valuable information on respondents. The panel will allow scholars to study citizen politics in new ways and will illuminate how election year politics affect judgments of the new administration in the formative months of its term.<br/><br/>A second new data collection enterprise involves a partnership with the Ohio State University Center<br/>for Human Resource Research. They conduct the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which has been interviewing a nationally representative panel of adults and their children for decades with breathtakingly long and varied questionnaires. Questions measuring political attitudes and behaviors will be included in these surveys for the first time, allowing the study of developmental and socialization experiences through the life-cycle and across generations.<br/><br/>To help scholars develop and validate new measurement tools for use in the above-listed surveys, an<br/>ANES pilot study will be run in November, 2006, reinterviewing respondents from the 2004 ANES.<br/>The components of this data collection plan each strengthen the others. Alone, each component will<br/>allow a broad range of scholars to evaluate the robustness of old and new theoretical claims. In addition, each endeavor will be designed to facilitate coordinated analysis with all the other data collections. The specifics of the designs of all these studies will be determined by an array of scholars more intellectually diverse than ever before. Its new PIs and Board of Overseers hail from more universities and a broader range of disciplines than any of its predecessors. <br/><br/>This research project includes a new Internet-based procedure for soliciting, processing, reviewing, and providing feedback on proposals for study design elements from anyone who wishes to offer them. All this will be done with an unprecedented transparency to the user community. Because these activities will generate a huge amount of data, detailed plans have been designed outlining how the management of the study design, data collection, and data dissemination processes will be carried out by the experienced technical staff that is already in place. In addition to coordinating the questionnaire design and fieldwork processes, the staff will maintain and update the study's huge and multifaceted website by adding the newly collected data and also dramatically enhancing the study's electronic archives of previously-collected information dating back from the 1940s.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: By generating large, multifaceted datasets of high quality, the ANES will equip researchers to learn new and important lessons about the world of politics. These data will be distributed widely and quickly to serve thousands of scholars and to be used in classrooms around the world to enrich research and education. Americans want to understand how its democracy works. The ANES will help to inform the nation about itself, exploring the causes and consequences of voting behavior and electoral outcomes. With such knowledge, the polity will be better equipped to nurture and refine its system of government."

By both sharing resources and best practices across the alliance and including SBE fields in existing AGEP programs, the CUNY/MAA Alliance for the SBE sciences will increase participation in summer research programs, expand recruitment and research opportunities for social sciences students, further develop targeted relationships with minority-serving institutions, provide across the alliance student mentoring and mentoring training for faculty, coordinate skill building workshops to help ensure graduate study success, expand student support groups, enhance fellowship support, increase teaching opportunities and expand teacher training workshops, increase the support of students attending professional workshops, and expand postdoctoral and early career education. The intellectual merit of the project will focus on the advancement of education by enhancing existing excellent educational programs and providing SBE students at the graduate, postdoctoral and early career stages with additional experiences that they would not normally receive. The impact of these interventions will be evaluated and best practices shared widely. Our experiences will enhance knowledge on the methodologies critical to the process of the professionalization of social and behavioral scientists. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. The broader impact of the project will develop through the institutionalization of a larger pool of individuals studying and conducting research in the social sciences through the utilization of effective strategies that will attract, motivate, and train domestic talent, especially among underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities. The result of these activities will be to advance understanding of the role of the social sciences in the nation, as well as to strengthen the national workforce."

The formal principles underlying these systems are applicable across a wide range of domains. Although the broad applicability of these principles speaks to their importance, it also represents a challenge to educators to convey these principles in a way that students can appreciate the principle at a sufficiently abstract level that the student can transfer the principle across superficially unrelated domains. The current research addresses the question of when and how do have students transfer what they have learned about scientific principles to new situations. Our proposed research explores methods for teaching students about scientific principles in a manner that leads to grounded yet transportable knowledge. A central inquiry of this proposal concerns the relation between the superficial, concrete details through which a phenomenon is presented, and the abstraction of deeper scientific principles underlying the phenomenon.<br/><br/>Our experiments explore the role of perceptually-based simulations in fostering students' scientific understanding. By observing how active exploration of one simulation benefits understanding of a subsequently presented simulation based on the same principle, we can assess whether the scientific principle has been successfully abstracted. Experiments will explore the roles of graphical concreteness, narrative contextualization, language specificity, and diagrams on students' implicit and explicit knowledge of scientific principles. One research outcome will be prescriptions for how and when concrete and highly contextualized materials should be used, compared to idealized and decontextualized materials. One line of research focuses on the language that accompanies interactive computer simulations by manipulating the concreteness and abstractness of words. These experiments explore how best to use words to foster transferable knowledge: by gradually introducing increasingly abstract language, by combining abstract language with concrete visuals (or vice versa), or by using concrete but metaphorically related words.<br/><br/>A second line of experiments aims to give participants first-person experiences with scientific principles to test whether they promote spontaneous transfer across analogous situations. Using the scientific principle of Signal Detection Theory, we will compare direct experience with a signal detection task with explicit instruction. Further experiments will determine if the advantages of experience vs. instruction are modulated by the perceptual concreteness of the simulations, and the narrative richness of the training scenario.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of the inquiry is to gain an understanding of how perceptual experience can lead to abstract conceptual understanding, and how conceptual understanding can change perceptual experience. The practical goal is to translate this understanding into general educational principles for integrating computer simulations into classroom activities."

While the lakeshore may constitute a relatively tiny area of the lake disturbed by humans, this nearshore area frequently may be the most critical habitat for breeding and feeding by fish and other animals. Here the importance of nearshore environments will be evaluated through examination of naturally occurring stable isotopes in tissues from lake animals and plants; carbon isotopes can indicate whether growth is mainly supported by nearshore or open water food resources, and nitrogen isotopes relate to an organism's position in the ""food chain"". Stable isotopes can also help differentiate among different nutrient pollutants that fuel growth of nuisance algae, such that managers can more effectively target monitoring and control. <br/><br/>Disturbance to the shoreline can affect ecosystem functioning long before the rest of the lake appears polluted. Managers increasingly call for controls on nearshore pollution, although lake-wide consequences of localized disturbances are not yet well understood. This research will provide critical information on the role of nearshore environments in structuring plant and animal communities and help prioritize management and conservation efforts in lakes."

Many of the ideas were originally developed by philosophers who observed that the traditional view that optimal decision making involves maximizing the probability of obtaining the most resources (evidential expected utility theory) fails to explain how people take the causes and effects of their actions into account when they make decisions. The key idea is that choice is not merely a selection of an option from a set of alternatives, but an intervention that changes not only the state of the world, but also the model we should use to represent how the world works. The key psychological claims of the theory are that people represent the world by decomposing it into autonomous mechanisms that support interventions and that choice suspends some of those mechanisms in the causal model relevant to a decision. Experiments will (i) test people's sensitivity to causal structure as well as the hypothesis that choice is an intervention; (ii) examine the proposed model by framing it in terms of causal expected utility and contrasting it to a more standard model of evidential expected utility in the context of both simple scenarios and two-player games; (iii) examine what people can learn about the world and about choice strategies from observing one's own and others' choices; and (iv) examine various actual and apparent boundary conditions on the theory such as the role of self-deception in choice. The research has implications for how people should make all kinds of decisions (personal, medical, policy, strategy, etc.). It also has implications for how to improve decision-making, specifically, by first understanding the causal structure of a situation before attempting to make decisions in it."

The ability of lizards, for example, to adhere to a variety of rough and smooth surfaces using relatively stiff materials is remarkable. A common feature for contact and universal adhesion against an indeterminate surface, with important variations based on species, is the use of a hierarchical fibrillar structure with a plate-like spatular terminal element. It appears from recent studies that its unique surface properties, such as adhesion, tribology, and re-usability, result from optimized architectural design. This project aims to develop materials with fibrillar interfaces that mimic surface structures in lizards and insects.<br/>This work is being conducted jointly by three academic researchers working in close collaboration with an industrial research group at the DuPont Company. Their work requires the influence of several disciplines. Biological studies are undertaken to examine the details of the designs Nature has evolved and the materials she uses. The investigators develop theoretical models to understand how materials properties and architecture relate to performance. Phenomena that need to be understood are the enhanced contact compliance offered by these materials, constraints due to phenomena such as lateral collapse under the influence of surface forces, and mechanisms by which energy dissipation is enhanced during interfacial separation. These are converted into design criteria for biomimetic structures. The investigators fabricate fibrillar structures based on these design criteria using micro-lithographic techniques and test their performance as surfaces with useful properties.<br/>If successful in its ultimate aim, this program will provide society with an entirely new class of fastener materials. Anticipated properties, such as one-sidedness, re-usability, low rate-dependence, and designed directionality, form a unique set not accessible by extant fasteners, for example, pressure sensitive adhesives and hook/loop fasteners (e.g. Velcro). We expect the new material will find use in applications as diverse as apparel, semiconductor handling, and robotics. The project will train graduate students to work in a highly interdisciplinary manner. It balances high scientific quality and training with industrial relevance and interest."

Watkins <br/>Institution: University of Massachusetts/Amherst<br/>Proposal Number: 0529034<br/>Title: Sensors: Hierarchical Metal Oxides for Next Generation Devices<br/><br/>The ability to control the structure and surface properties of hierarchical metal oxides across length scales ranging from a few nanometers to several centimeters offers the promise of next generation sensors with dramatically improved sensitivity, selectivity and response time. Realization of that potential, however, requires the development of efficient fabrication strategies that enable prescriptive control over the size, structure, and orientation of nanometer scale pores and provide the ability to control surface chemistry and placement of functional elements within these structures. Target structures include defect free silica, alumina and titania films containing well-ordered spherical pores and close-packed arrays of uniform, functionalized cylindrical pores of prescribed diameter oriented normal to substrate in these materials. The latter elements offer not only large surface to volume ratios, but also short and unencumbered diffusion paths for analytes and thin pore walls such that their electronic properties are strongly influenced by surface processes, a key to high sensitivity. Finally, a fabrication scheme that can be integrated directly into existing device fabrication lines is required for high volume production. The PI has developed a new approach for mesoporous oxides that can achieve these objectives.<br/><br/>His approach involves the phase-selective condensation of metal alkoxides within specific sub-domains of pre-organized block copolymer template films dilated with supercritical carbon dioxide. Subsequent removal of the template yields a well-ordered mesoporous solid that retains all of the structural detail of microphase separated block copolymers. Recently he validated this approach for the preparation of device-quality silicate films on full process Si wafers for application as ultra low dielectric constant films. Here he exploits enabling aspects of the 3-D replication process to produce hierarchical silica, titania and alumina films as constructs for sensor applications. These include (1) the separation of template organization from metal oxide network formation, which provides flexible process chemistry through independent selection of template and precursor and removes constraints associated with cooperative selfassembly, (2) the use of a non-aqueous reaction media that is compatible with hydrolytically sensitive precursors for titania, alumina and other metal oxides, and (3) manipulation of block copolymer architecture by domain orientation and alignment prior to precursor infusion, which enables the production of nanochannel arrays of cylindrical pores oriented normal to the substrate surface with tunable pore diameters. Once the metal oxide framework is in place, control of surface chemistry is essential for maximizing sensor performance. The transport properties of supercritical CO2 offer distinct advantages for surface modifications using organosilanes and hydridosilane chemistry within nanostructured oxides. In addition to controlling the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of the substrate surface, these modifications can provide reactive handles for immobilization of enzymes and metal clusters on the pore walls. Finally, doping the templates with active species prior to precursor infusion provides an alternative route to functionalizing the metal oxides by encapsulation.<br/><br/>Technical Merit: The scientific core is the development of a rapid and efficient route for the preparation of functionalized hierarchical metal oxides as a platform for nanosensor device applications. Successful replication of block copolymer morphologies to yield well-ordered mesoporous titania and alumina films, including control of pore orientation and pore dimensions would represent a significant advance in materials science. The fabrication of nanochannel arrays in silicates, alumina and titania with pores of defined size, ranging between 10 and 45 nm, presents an optimal substrate for enhancing the performance of broad classes of sensors. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The development of well-defined metal oxide films with nanometer-scale periodicity is of interest for numerous applications including catalysis, separations, microfluidics, energy conversion and low dielectric constant films in microelectronics. An efficient and general means for their production would have broad impact. For example, nanochannel arrays in titania similar to those produced here for sensors would be ideal for the fabrication of high surface area heterojunctions for conjugated polymer photovoltaic cells, while well-ordered silicates containing immobilized enzymes or highly-dispersed metal clusters would have certain application in catalysis. The project will expose graduate students to interdisciplinary research and involve the participation of undergraduate students. Project results will be put in modular form for use in existing curriculum including a survey course in nanotechnology and an undergraduate laboratory course and used as an example of applications of nanotechnology during secondary school visits hosted by MassNanoTech on the UMass Amherst campus."

But two major sociological theories of identity- affect control theory and identity control theory- make diametrically opposing predictions about how people respond to over-reward. This project will examine two main questions: (1) How do people feel when they are treated better than they feel they deserve? (2) What is the relationship between feeling and action in these situations of over-reward? The PIs will use innovative physiological measures to resolve this theoretical controversy in the sociological literature. This research will offer a new understanding of the relationship between identity, injustice, and emotion, while developing new measurement techniques to better distinguish the theoretical constructs of emotion and identity disconfirmation. The researchers hypothesize that emotional response to injustice is more related to identity than to justice itself. It is only when one thinks that one is being a bad person by being over-rewarded- getting ahead at someone else's expense and with their knowledge- that over-reward makes one feel bad. Over-reward will lead to negative emotion only when it creates a negative identity. Otherwise, the experience of receiving more than one deserves will disconfirm the pre-existing identity in a positive direction, and produce positive emotion. An interesting, counter-intuitive prediction of affect control theory is that even though over-rewarded participants will feel good, they will act to reduce the over-reward in future rounds of the experiments. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research has broader implications for work settings, political policy discussions and for understanding social movement. They will specify the conditions that lead to behavioral remedy for injustice, and the occasions in which other mechanisms are likely to be available for resolving any stress that results from over-reward. Since those who are under-rewarded are often not well positioned to help themselves gain more resources, the reactions of the over-rewarded are key to addressing many forms of injustice."

Yet, no widely-accepted mathematical theory currently exists to quantitatively characterize surprise elicited by a stimulus or event, for observers that range from single neurons to complex natural or engineered systems. This project develops a formal Bayesian definition of surprise that is the only consistent formulation under minimal axiomatic assumptions. Surprise quantifies how data affects natural or artificial observers, by measuring the difference between posterior and prior beliefs of the observers. Preliminary human eye-tracking experiments demonstrated that participants gaze towards surprising image regions, significantly more than expected by chance, while watching complex videoclips including TV and video games. What are the underlying<br/>neural mechanisms responsible for this behavior? This cross-disciplinary proposal addresses this question as follows:<br/><br/>- Theory and modeling, to investigate how surprise relates to previous notions of saliency and novelty, and may advantageously complement Shannon information when analyzing neural function and behavior.<br/><br/>- Monkey electrophysiology with simple surprising stimuli, to investigate how single-neurons along the sensorimotor processing stream (primary visual cortex, frontal eye fields, superior colliculus) may be modulated by surprise.<br/><br/>- Parallel human/monkey psychophysics/electrophysiology, to investigate, in natural situations and with more complex stimuli including TV programs, whether stimuli which attract human and monkey attention may carry more Bayesian surprise.<br/><br/>The theory of surprise developed here is applicable across different modalities, datatypes, tasks, and abstraction levels. It has potential for impacting science and engineering, and especially education in computer science, mathematics, information theory, statistics, psychology and biology. The research involves undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral trainees in a collaboration between a theory lab (Baldi), a modeling and psychophysics lab (Itti), and a monkey electrophysiology lab (Munoz)."

Additionally, each component of the coefficient vector and each component of the basis set of vectors can be described individually, allowing each component to be modeled separately. A combination of RBF neural networks and time-lagged recurrent neural networks is used in implementing these principles.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will use, as its initial testbed, the challenge of monitoring temperature distributions across space in a boiler furnace. More accurate monitoring of boilers may be useful not only in diagnostics and maintenance but also in control; more effective boiler control can improve efficiency somewhat and reduce pollution substantially. Testbeds involving jet engines and flexible structures will also be considered. Boilers, furnaces and jet engines account for a majority of major pollutants like NOx around the world.

The<br/>state of the art technology in this area involves the use of the stencil-printing process, in which a thin<br/>layer of solder-paste is deposited on the surface of the substrate and pads, followed by the automatic<br/>positioning of the components onto their designated places. The continued demand for higher component density of integrated circuits has lead to an ever-shrinking size of these components, and hence, the positioning issue has become the major handicap, due the very rigid requirements on the assembly process. In particular, the height, area or volume of solder-paste bricks may affect placement accuracy because of the lateral movement of components as leads move through the matrix in the placement process, thus reducing the yield and reliability of the high-density circuits. It is therefore expected that the current surface-mount technologies will soon reach their maximum capability to accommodate the growing needs of the industry and the shrinking size of the components, and as a consequence, component density would have reached saturation as well. To eliminate this bottleneck, a new surface-mount placement technology, operative in the nanometer (or sub-micron) size regime is sought. Hence, a new paradigm for the surface-mount placement process<br/>will have to be implemented. At these sub-micron dimensions, the solder-paste technology will have<br/>to be replaced by a smart, selective adhesive, that can essentially operate at the molecular-level,<br/>and can selectively form precision molecular bridges between the nano-pads and the nanocomponents.<br/> This proposal focuses on the utilization of well-known techniques from the surface selfassembly<br/>field, in order to construct functional surfaces on the metallic nano-pads that will subsequently bind irreversibly and uniquely to the deposited nanocomponents with very low error and very few processing steps. The smart adhesive will comprise of molecules that will bind selectively to metallic surfaces, nanopads on one side and nanocomponents on the other, forming an interactive, bridging, conductive layer. The desired precision of the processes involved will also call for new ideas in feedback control. Measurements and evaluations of events at the molecular and nanoscale level will need to be translated into observable macroscopic quantities. Hence, mathematical models and resulting computer simulations of the type for which control/systems engineers have a particular expertise may be very helpful in driving some of the specific experiments. In particular, concepts of from particle systems and discrete Markov chains to model the processes involved may be useful. Therefore, the synergistic collaboration of a material scientist and a control theorist will constitute a great opportunity for a comprehensive nano-interconnect system<br/>development.<br/> The Intellectual Merit of the proposal lies in the bottom-up strategy for the design of an optimal system for a given application. Understanding, down to the molecular level, of the different requirements for the development of a surface-mount placement process that can successfully operate at the nanoscale regime, will afford the choice of the precisely correct building block for the synthesis and assembly of this system. The synergistic combination of experimental work and mathematical modeling will ensure that the process that will be developed will possess the optimal properties in terms of stability (chemical and thermal), selectivity and conductivity.<br/> The Broader Impacts of the proposal are both technical and educational. On the technical side, the success of this work will no doubt constitute a paradigm shift in the field of surface mount technology, since it will open up a new size regime and new opportunities for component densities that were unattainable with existing technologies. Moreover, on the educational side, it will expose the graduate students working in these fields to a broader perspective of their area of research, and ultimately generate engineers who are comfortable and well educated in interdisciplinary environments."

Sims, Patricia G. Gensel, and Scott L. Wing<br/><br/>Plants first appeared on land roughly 410 million years ago. Since then, there clearly has been a massive increase in the number of plant species, the spatial complexity of terrestrial vegetation, and the range of habitats that plants occupy. The taxonomic composition of terrestrial vegetation also has changed completely. Although major trends and events affecting terrestrial plants have long been identified in a descriptive way and quantitative data exist for many local sites and short time intervals, there has been only one attempt to quantify the major Phanerozoic trends in plant diversity and floral composition. Recent advances in the statistical analysis of diversity data, increasing recognition of the importance of spatial scale for interpreting diversity data, and growing acceptance of bioinformatic databases as important tools for maximizing the value of published data, make this the right time for a new quantification of long-term trends in the ecology of terrestrial plants. We have formed a working group of fifteen paleobotanists whose specialties span the temporal and biological spectrum to collect high-quality data on Silurian to Paleogene fossil plant localities, occurrences, and taxa as part of the Paleobiology Database (http://flatpebble.nceas.ucsb.edu/public/). The result will be a public, web-based repository for fossil occurrence data- a ""GenBank"" for the plant fossil record. With these data, we will assess the effects of sampling biases on changes in estimated global plant diversity, examine environmental correlates of diversity change, and track changes in diversity at local, regional, and global scales."

The main goals of this thematic Center are to broaden understanding of the oceans in the context of the earth and solar systems and to help the COSEE network reach rural and inland audiences. The PIs will pioneer a system of interfaces, tools, and resources to reach underserved and underrepresented groups, and to bring ocean sciences to inland audiences by presenting it in the context of more familiar components of the earth system, including environmental and space sciences. One goal is to explore the effectiveness of expanding knowledge of the ocean's role beyond being a driver of earth's climate to placing the earth in the context of its unique place in the solar system. Activities include building and training educator-scientist teams to work towards specific goals, e.g., testing strategies for effective use of ocean data, training in the use of concept mapping, and the identification and evaluation of high-quality resources. Evaluation of products, models and information is integrated throughout, with continuous self-assessment. Formal education partners at the University of Maine and University of New Hampshire will test the efficacy of materials with educators whose knowledge of ocean-related content ranges from novice to expert. Maine will be a test bed for the COSEE network to start reaching inland rural populations. The team includes scientists and educators with expertise in the hydrosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, and atmosphere. The team will develop concept maps and case studies that show application of ocean topics to the National Science Education Standards. <br/>The Center will develop a formal mechanism for scientific review of materials to ensure the products they recommend are of the highest quality and meet rigorous standards, as well as to provide feedback from educators and scientists to product developers. They will select resources from DLESE, the BRIDGE, NOAA and others and evaluate these for classroom readiness and scientific accuracy using their team of well-trained resource evaluators with first-hand knowledge of earth systems science. They also will do a ""gap analysis"" of missing resources. The ""Gap Analysis"" will also inform the science community about avoiding developing materials for well-covered topics. The review process developed by COSEE-OESS, from initial use of NASA's education product review, will be disseminated nationally as a model for evaluating best practices and assessment and evaluation guidelines for education materials.<br/> In-service teacher programs will focus on expansion of University of New Hampshire's Coastal Observing Center summer in-service teacher workshops to incorporate OESS content and evaluation of activities (""test bed"" for novel materials and activities). These workshops have annual themes focusing on ocean observing systems and the integration of buoy, shipboard, and satellite data (GoMOOS). Pre-service teachers and general science students at the University of Maine will take a new course created by OESS to learn ocean research methods by focusing on using physical principles, concepts and approaches to explain phenomena in aquatic sciences that are aligned to the NSES. The course will be developed for distribution to teachers after rigorous evaluation.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit of the Center: This thematic center focuses on creating and evaluating a series of interconnected tools and techniques designed to broaden understanding of the ocean in the context of the earth and solar systems. Results will be translated into innovative multimedia products that showcase the ocean in the earth-sun system. Educational resources will be evaluated for science and education impact, and gaps in these resources will be identified and filled. A new undergraduate course to teach about ocean phenomena will be developed, tested, and disseminated nationally. The proposed Center will help COSEE reach inland and rural audiences. <br/><br/>Broader impact: This Center will serve as a ""learning organization"" to deliver excellent products, models, and information that can be applied virtually anywhere. The final products, publication of ""Best Practices"" (a document that describes the value of system context in terms of learning) and ""Strategies to reach inland audiences"" will be disseminated throughout and beyond the COSEE network."

The closest relatives to Tlingit are languages of the Athabaskan family and the nearly extinct language Eyak. Nearly all of the estimated 150 remaining fluent speakers in Alaska are middle-aged or elderly people. Among this group, only the oldest generation has a full range of fluency and is capable of distinguishing the finer subtleties and nuances held in the language. Adding to the endangerment of the language is its level of complexity. The Tlingit verb has 11 prefix and suffix positions. Combining these with the verb stem results in contractions which often drastically change their original form. Overall, the conjugation of Tlingit verbs is very complex, differing greatly from the familiar patterns found in the Romance and Germanic languages, thus making Tlingit quite difficult to learn as a second language. <br/><br/>This project consists of three closely related activities which advance the documentation of the Tlingit language and add to the available resources for language teachers and learners alike. The activities include: the development of a reference grammar of Tlingit which will serve to explain the grammar to language learners in as non-technical a way as possible; the completion of Intermediate Tlingit, a pedagogical textbook and Principal Parts, a verb book which will provide verb paradigms for roughly 200 verbs; and the digitization of a large collection of approximately 40-year-old audio cassette tapes containing Tlingit narrative, oratory and ethnographic information - a wealth of primary data in the language. The project investigators will conduct research through consultation with fluent speakers to inform the reference grammar, text book, and verb book. Data gathered from speakers will be recorded and organized into learner-friendly grammatical explanations. The audio cassette tapes will be digitized in a professional studio and will then be archived in the Sealaska Heritage Institute archives.<br/><br/>This project will also provide insight into the complex structure of Tlingit grammar and will add to the corpus of linguistic data available to linguists as well as cognitive scientists. In addition, the project activities will provide much needed Tlingit language resources to a growing body of language learners and teachers committed to the revitalization of the language."

The work proposed herein will especially explore these<br/>potentials in computer graphics and visualization. Building up<br/>conformal structures recasts many three dimensional (3D) geometric<br/>problems into two dimensions (2D) and leads to efficient approaches<br/>for a number of fundamental geometric problems.

Many laws of<br/>physics are governed by conformal structures. For example, heat<br/>diffusion and electromagnetic field distribution on surfaces,<br/>tension in soap bubbles and parts of string theory in theoretical<br/>physics are determined by conformal surface structures.

To illustrate<br/>this potential, consider one aspect of conformal structures, namely<br/>the canonical flattening of a surface into a plane, resulting in an<br/>image like representation of seemingly complicated three dimensional<br/>geometry.

In this project the relationships between naturally occurring genetic and phenotypic variation in Pinus taeda L. will be identified. Loblolly pine, a gymnosperm, is well-positioned phylogenetically to help in understanding the evolution of adaptive traits in land plants. Specific objectives are to (1) identify all common variants in 5000 genes, creating a first-of-its-kind community resource of genomic sequence for loblolly pine, and (2) associate genetic variation at 1000 loci with traits of economic importance. The traits will include chemical and anatomical wood properties and resistance to disease. All DNA sequence data will be submitted immediately to public access databases, GenBank and TreeGenes (dendrome.ucdavis.edu). Genotypic and phenotypic data will be immediately deposited into TreeGenes. The overarching goal of community coalescence will be accomplished by integrating loblolly pine genomics and bioinformatics efforts across the United States and making them available through the public databases. <br/>Identification of specific genes controlling naturally occurring phenotypic variation will provide 1) a greater understanding of trait inheritance in plants, 2) an indirect selection tool for tree breeders, and 3) a set of potentially useful genetic reagents for genetic modification. By aggressively seeking to identify most of the major genes controlling specific wood property and disease related traits in loblolly pine, a significant breakthrough is anticipated in the understanding of the genetics of complex traits and the potential economic impact of indirect selection. Marker-aided-selection based on desired variants in genes controlling economic traits can be used across pedigrees within both breeding and natural populations. Such a tool would have immediate and beneficial ramifications for applied tree improvement programs by dramatically reducing testing costs and breeding cycle times. Ultimately, such information could be useful in guiding gene conservation efforts and enhancing our ability to cope with the growing challenges of climate change, shifting habitats and evolving pest populations."

(2) Changes in South Pacific intermediate water oxygenation are forced by changes in the local rain rate of organic carbon. They will generate multi-proxy records of particle flux and bottom water oxygen to address dynamic changes in the globally important Antarctic Intermediate Water system, capitalizing on a set of three sites which have high sedimentation rates (>1 m/ka) and well-constrained stratigraphy. The sites occur along a depth and latitudinal transect off central Chile. This region documents variations in Antarctic Intermediate Water where it interacts with subsurface waters of tropical-to-subtropical origin, and with underlying Pacific Deep Water. They will utilize a combination of non-traditional but well-tested tracers of carbon export (231Pa/230Th and Th-normalized biogenic fluxes) and sedimentary reducing conditions (Mo, Re, U). These tracers will be coupled to more traditional studies of nutrient-like proxies (d13C in foraminifera), radiocarbon, nitrogen isotope tracers of denitrification and/or nutrient utilization, and micropaleontology of both fauna (foraminifera and radiolarians) and flora (diatoms and nannofossils). <br/><br/>A Ph.D. graduate student and two undergraduate students will be involved in the research.

This collaborative research project will focus on advancing the friction drilling process. Friction drilling is a novel hole-making technique used on sheet metal or thin wall casting by displacing and forming a bushing. The bushing provides the extended space for thread joining of devices. Friction drilling creates a bushing directly from the parent sheet metal in a clean, chipless process. All work-material from the hole contributes to form the bushing. In addition, no cutting fluid or lubricant is necessary, which makes the friction drilling process an environmentally friendly hole making process. Although the original patents on friction drilling have all expired, this process is still not well understood and it is little used in industry due to the lack of engineering information, such as tool geometry, tool material, and process parameter selection. This research project focuses on this need. Novel techniques will be developed to broaden the scope of applications for the friction drilling process. Two models will be developed: 1) an analytical model using the contact area and pressure and 2) a more complicated finite element modeling using ABAQUS software for modeling of work-flow with coupled large deformation, large strain, and high temperature. This method can generate a more comprehensive solution with the detailed temperature, stress, and strain distribution of the work-material.<br/><br/>Results of this research can be applied to the automotive, computer, and electronic assembly. Since the research is aimed at developing ""green"" drilling processes, it can have an impact on industry by reducing the production of waste and thus advancing environmentally benign manufacturing. The novel friction drilling can also simplify the factory production and inventory system by eliminating the expensive robotic welding machine and supplies of nuts on the shop floor. Close collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Ford Motor Company are expected. This government-industry-university-international collaboration will aid in human resource development by exposing a graduate student to novel friction drilling process development with the aim for environmental protection."

Engineering applications involving fluid-thermal systems are characterized by complex three-dimensional flows with incomplete knowledge of boundary conditions in critical subsystems and limited access for experimental diagnostics. An example is the combustor in a turbofan engine wherein the thermal boundary conditions on the combustor can surface are not known a priori (i.e., the surface temperature distribution is not known) and access for optical diagnostics is severely limited. The DDDAS-based methodology synergizes experiment and simulation to achieve an assessment of the fluid-thermal system; in particular, to determine the surface temperature distribution to a reasonable level of accuracy. The specific application is a turbulent jet injected normally into a subsonic or supersonic equilibrium turbulent boundary layer. By analogy to a combustor or furnace, the experimental diagnostics are assumed to be limited to optical measurements (specifically, diode laser absorbance at various wavelengths) within a restricted region (to simulate limited access in the actual configuration, e.g., combustor). Simulations will be performed using the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the k-e model of turbulence. Both non-reacting and reacting flows will be considered.<br/><br/>The proposed DDDAS-based methodology for assessment of fluid-thermal systems using experiment and simulation has potentially broader applications in engineering systems (e.g., chemical and biochemical engineering, civil engineering, etc)."

In 2003 the United States, for example, had more than 57 percent more merchandise trade - imports plus exports - with Canada and Mexico than it did with all of the 15 members of the European Union combined. This was in spite of the fact that the combined GDP of the 15 EU countries was more than 6 times larger than that of Canada plus Mexico. The data show that business cycles in the United States are far more coordinated with business cycles in Canada and Mexico than they are with the business cycles in the European Union. The data also show that fluctuations in the U.S.- Canada real exchange rate and the U.S.-Mexico real exchange rate are more correlated with fluctuations in economic fundamentals than are fluctuations in U.S.-EU bilateral real exchange rates. This proposal lays out a plan for developing models to analyze how the cross-country characteristics of macro aggregates relate to the amount of trade between countries. The proposed research would investigate the implications of modeling the costs of setting up trade relationships in models of international business cycles and real exchange rate fluctuations. Specifically, this project would model firms as facing fixed costs of exporting specific goods to a specific country, for example, in setting up a distribution network in that country. <br/><br/>This project plans to use the models developed for analyzing international business cycles, real exchange rate fluctuations and the effects of international trade and investment policy on aggregate productivity. Models constructed in the early 1990s to analyze the economic impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) did a poor job of predicting the changes in trade patterns that actually occurred following this agreement. The proposed research would help us to develop better models for analyzing the impact of trade and foreign investment liberalization. The models are also intended to help us understand why financial crises produced by a sudden reversal of international capital flows result in severe economic crises. In both Mexico in 1994-1995 and in Argentina in 2001-2002, sudden stops produced severe crises and large drops in productivity. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Providing satisfactory answers to the sorts of questions posed in this proposal is essential for both policy analysis and for raising the level of political debate here and abroad. Currently, the United States is negotiating free trade agreements with a number of countries in Latin America. To build better models to analyze the potential impact of such agreements, economists need to understand why the models built to analyze NAFTA did so poorly. The work on exchange rate fluctuations within and across trade blocs will help produce models to analyze the increased macroeconomic interdependence that follows liberalization. It will also provide measures of the potential gains from increased future trade between the countries of NAFTA and the European Union. This work offers a potential explanation of why the recent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro has not resulted is a large change in trade flows between the United States and Europe. The work on modeling financial crises and trade and foreign investment policy will provide measures of the potential costs and benefits of liberalizing trade and foreign investment policy, especially in developing countries that liberalize their trade and foreign investment policies. It is essential that economists develop a better understanding of events in Mexico and Argentina over the past decade if they are to reassure policy makers and the members of the press and the public who are having second thoughts about such liberalization policies."

Wight, University of Michigan Ann Arbor <br/><br/>It is proposed to use NEES testing facilities and associated simulation capabilities to develop new coupled wall systems and retrofit schemes for framed construction through the use of high-performance fiber reinforced cement composites (HPFRCC). This research was conceived from the idea that the next generation of reinforced concrete (RC) structures should utilize ductile cementitious materials in critical regions, rather than extensive reinforcement detailing to provide shear resistance and concrete confinement. A high-performance fiber reinforced cementitious composite (HPFRCC) that is ductile in tension, does not spall in compression, behaves like a confined concrete, and is capable of providing confinement to normal reinforcement, will be used. In addition to enhancing confinement and flexural behavior in plastic hinging regions, HPFRCC materials are capable of providing ductility and energy dissipation capabilities to shear critical members that are normally a difficult design issue for RC structures. The use of HPFRCC materials for such members will lead to less complicated reinforcement details, will be easier to construct, and will provide a high degree of damage tolerance, leading to superior seismic performance and reduced post-earthquake repair costs. The research will be conducted by a diverse and multidisciplinary team from three major universities, Michigan, Stanford and Illinois, with expertise in structural engineering, computational simulation, materials engineering, information technology and cyberinfrastructure deployment. Cooperative assistance with computation and simulation requirements has been offered by the MGRID and Sakai research groups at the University of Michigan. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: HPFRCC materials will be used as a tool to develop new coupling beam designs for RC structural wall systems and infill panels for seismic retrofitting of existing steel or RC framed structures. Shear wall systems are very popular for medium-rise structures in zones of high seismicity and the development of a coupling beam that is easier to construct than current diagonal reinforcing schemes, yet still can sustain large shear stress and displacement demands with good stiffness retention, will be a major original contribution. Also, there is a significant need for an efficient method to upgrade existing critical facilities that require structural and/or non-structural system protection. The development of ductile precast HPFRCC infill panels will result in an effective and practical method for enhancing the strength, stiffness and energy dissipation capabilities of deficient steel and RC frame structures, while allowing them to remain in full service during rehabilitation activities. Structural and materials engineering experts will collaborate on developing HPFRCC mixture designs that can be handled in a normal batch plant, trucked to the site and pumped to the casting location. Analytical models that accurately reproduce the behavior of HPFRCC under various stress states will be developed for simulation of structural behavior, for the control of the proposed pseudo-dynamic experiments, as well as for use by the earthquake engineering community in general. The combination of the computing power of the NEESgrid and MGRID, integrated with various structural simulation packages, offers a unique opportunity that will be pursued for the incorporation of highly detailed models in pseudo-dynamic testing of wall and frame systems.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: 1) One of the most significant broader impacts of this research will be the wider acceptance and use of highly damage-tolerant fiber reinforced concretes for enhancing structural performance during earthquakes. 2) The results of this research will provide the NEES community with the capability of using more sophisticated simulation models for hybrid testing of structural systems. 3) A multi-use environment based on the Sakai software platform (used in NEESgrid and course management systems across the country) will be further developed, where students and researchers will be able to do coursework and participate in experiments without negotiating separate tools, authenticating to different systems, or learning new interfaces. 4) A participatory experience for pre-engineering students at institutions affiliated with the Midwest Instructional Technology Center (MITC) will be created. Through the involvement of a diverse set of graduate and undergraduate researchers and outreach to students at small colleges, particularly women and under-represented minority students, a new generation of students<br/>will be introduced to the use of high-performance structural materials, behavior of structures during earthquakes, and sophisticated structural analysis and simulation techniques."

This short-term, exploratory investigation captures data on public attitudes toward, and personal adjustment action intentions in response to, long-term coastal hazards. The focus is on the influence of Katrina on public views about future hurricanes and the related but long term threats of global warming. The study focuses specifically on publics in six coastal cities not impacted by Katrina. It explores how attitudes and intentions of the respondents have developed soon after the current Gulf disaster, and months after the emergency/short-term recovery period is over. Data come from a total exploratory respondent group of 300 adults randomly sampled in equal proportions (50 from each city) who are surveyed at two points in time. The objectives are to: 1. understand how major hazard impacts influence public thinking about future threats, including more uncertain ones far in the future; 2. understand how personal actions to learn more about or adjust to such hazards develop dynamically over time and; 3. explore methods to understand public views on hazards more developmentally, beyond one-time snapshots of views. <br/><br/>This study contributes to our understanding of how a centennial disaster of Katrina's scale affects public opinion toward and intentions to adjust to coastal hazards and related long-term global change threats. The underutilized methodology of longitudinal engagement of the public in such studies is explored. As such, this study can contribute to knowledge-based public deliberation about long-term hazards policy and also suggest methods to explore long-debated but infrequently tested issues about how to support large-scale public engagement in long-term hazards planning at a national level."

A first goal is to extend recent progresses in the economic analysis of group behavior, which can be applied to households, families, firms, committees, clubs, villages, and other organizations. Mathematically, these problems can be translated into systems of partial differential equations, which are in general 'highly' non linear and can be studied using the tools of exterior differential calculus. These techniques will be extended to currently open questions and to new types of problems. A second goal is to explore the links between three fields of microeconomic theory: hedonic demands, matching models, and multidimensional contract theory. These fields share a common mathematical nature, namely maximization over sets of measure-preserving mappings (known in mathematics as 'transportation' problems). An explicit and careful formal analysis of these common features will allow extending and generalizing the innovations that have been introduced in each field. In particular, the general approaches provided by transportation mathematics, based on measure theory, should lead to general existence theorem for a broad class of hedonic models; conversely, tools that have been developed by economists may have useful applications in mathematics (e.g., an extension of the so-called Gale-Shapley algorithm, used in matching models, can be used for transportation problems). Finally, a special emphasis will be put on a specific type of problems that are related to the two previous classes. Mathematically, they deal with uniqueness of the solution to general systems of partial differential equations when the number of equations is larger than the number of functions; the economic importance of these problems stems from their use in nonparametric identification. <br/><br/>The research will merge various fields of economics and mathematics that, in the past, have experienced independent (and somewhat divergent) developments. One can expect that economic analysis will raise new mathematical issues and questions, while mathematical concepts may generate new economic insights. More generally, the cross-fertilization the project is aimed at achieving is important per se, in that it can promote conceptual and empirical innovations in both fields. A particularly important aspect will be the emphasis put on cross-training of PhD students and/or junior researchers in both fields. Finally, the economic problems under consideration raise important policy issues, while they generate new mathematical challenges.

The project will provide a controlled test of the claim that bridging cultural differences in how one understands science will lead to improved learning of science content knowledge. The PIs' previous research with the Menominee has indicated that rural Native-American children begin school with a relatively precocious understanding of biology, but that this initial knowledge of the natural world does not translate into superior learning in traditional science curricula. On standardized tests Menominee children score above the national average in science in fourth grade, but by eighth grade it is their worst subject. The PIs explore the hypothesis that Native-American practices may clash with the cultural context and methodology used in the formal teaching of science. The proposal includes studies that will explore the educational relevance of cultural differences in approaches to the teaching of science and it includes the design, implementation, and evaluation of an after-school program. The initial studies will continue the researchers efforts to identify barriers to Native-American science learning and to develop and test strategies for building on the cultural knowledge that Native-American children bring to the classroom. Research on children's folkbiology has been conducted almost exclusively with individuals from urban North American populations. The proposed research will bring more evidence to bear on the problem of science learning in minority culture contexts. <br/><br/>"

It is assumed that the success of predators, like ladybugs, is more or less the same whether they are found on corn plants or pea plants. This assumption does not fit our commonsense experience of the world. It is harder to move through some environments than others because of spatial complexity, and this limitation of mobility should affect species interactions such as the predator-prey relationship. As environments become more complex the encounter rate of predators and prey should decrease. Therefore, in the same way that chemical reactions slow down in complex media (i.e., they are ""diffusion-limited"" because of the slow movement of molecules in complex spaces), so to we expect a reduction in predation success on plants with complex shapes. In the proposed research, models based on this expectation will be developed and tested using a predator-prey system that is important in agriculture. Naturally occurring pea mutants have been widely adopted for commercial use, however the more complex shape of these peas may alter the efficacy of beneficial insects. Using pea mutants with differing degrees of leaf complexity, the author will examine the predation success of the ladybug Harmonia axyridis, a commonly used beneficial insect, on pea aphids in laboratory and greenhouse conditions. By using this experimental system she will simultaneously test a new ecological theory and evaluate of the effects of plant morphology on biological control programs."

Protostomes constitute more than one million of the 1.7 million named species of living organisms, including familiar animals such as mollusks, insects, earthworms, flatworms, roundworms, and many others of medical and economic importance. However, relationships among these groups are still contentious, so the backbone of the animal tree of life cannot currently be proposed without a large degree of uncertainty. This proposal will integrate and disseminate the broadest possible collection of information on selected representative animals to address questions of their origin and evolution over more than 540 million years. In order to do this we will integrate anatomical data on extant and extinct fauna with developmental data using cell-lineage studies and broad-based genomic information. Those data will be collected for a large pool of protostome species which will be studied at a level never before attempted in non-model organisms. The outcome of this research will contribute to rewriting what it is known about animal evolution.<br/> The awarded grant will contribute to the training of students at different academic levels, emphasizing underrepresented groups in science. Results will be disseminated to society through partnership with five of the most prominent natural history museums in the world, including the Harvard Museum of Natural History and the American Museum of Natural History in the USA, and the most important museums in Australia and Denmark. It is also the intention of the AToL protostome team to publish an article in non-specialist scientific magazines for a broad lay audience."

However, there has been a lack of research on the effect of tsunami waves on coastal infrastructure such as buildings, bridges, and harbor facilities. Furthermore, design guidelines are lacking. To overcome this deficiency, this research will develop the methodology and tools for implementation of site specific Performance Based Tsunami Engineering (PBTE) for use in the analysis, evaluation, design and retrofit of coastal structures and facilities. The technical focus of the work is the simulation of fluid-structure interaction, development of structural loading time histories, and the application of these in a non-linear structural analysis to determine the expected performance of the constructed facilities.

A first set of models will focus on quantity-based revenue management, where the demand distribution is independent of the decision-maker's actions. A second set of models will apply the data-driven paradigm to price-based revenue management, where the demand distribution, and hence the data, is affected by the decision variables. Specifically, this research project will investigate the following three questions: (i) How should additional data be incorporated into the algorithm to yield robust solutions, especially when part of the historical data might now be obsolete? (ii) How can the optimization module steer the data collection process, not only in terms of measurement frequency, but also with respect to the quantities monitored? (iii) How can the wealth of available data be manipulated in an efficient manner, so that the added clarity about the state of the system does not come at the expense of computational tractability? The analysis will involve techniques from the fields of financial risk management, control theory, robust regression and mathematical programming, as well as large-scale simulations to assess the robustness and performance of the approach. <br/>If successful, this research will provide a comprehensive mathematical model of revenue management under uncertainty that will be more tightly connected to the available data without overly depending on any one assumption about demand. It will allow practitioners to take into account randomness in a more intuitive manner, and hence will promote the use of state-of-the-art optimization models and computational techniques in industry. Moreover, the models and algorithms developed in this work will offer a new approach to decision-making under uncertainty of interest to the whole operations research community and with applications to a wide array of domains."

EarthChem is based on and will expand the long-term collaborative effort of the successful geochemical online databases PetDB, NAVDAT, and GEOROC. In order to achieve its goals, EarthChem will develop a 'One-stop-shop for geochemical data' (EarthChem portal) with search capabilities across federated databases, a user interface that offers simple and straightforward access to all data holdings with the ability to obtain datasets specifically tailored to the user's individual needs in a standardized and integrated output format, and generally applicable tools for data quality assessment and data analysis and visualization. EarthChem's second focus is the expansion of data holdings through incorporation of both legacy and future data, to provide access to and integrate the widest and richest datasets possible. Strategies include the facilitation of data submission from users and publishers via online interactive tools, contribution of focused projects, and entry of critical datasets as identified by the community."

Both systems will be considered <br/>across a gradient of land use intensity, i.e., with study sites surrounded <br/>to varying extents by agriculture and urban/suburban development. The <br/>following questions will be investigated: (1) How do pollinator communities <br/>change (in terms of number of species, community composition, abundance and <br/>biomass) with increasing land use intensity? (2) What are the functional <br/>consequences of pollinator community change for native plant and crop <br/>pollination? (3) What environmental factors most strongly influence <br/>pollination function?<br/><br/>The work will benefit society at large, because as human populations <br/>grow, it becomes increasingly important to maintain ecosystem services that <br/>prevent shortages of water, energy and food. Crop pollination provided by <br/>wild species, which depend on natural habitats, can provide economic <br/>incentives for conserving these habitats. The investigators will transmit <br/>the results of their study to land owners and land managers through <br/>workshops, manuals, the media, and collaborative projects with conservation <br/>and farming organizations.  The broader impacts of this work will also <br/>include promoting teaching, training and learning by providing <br/>opportunities for independent and collaborative undergraduate projects, <br/>focusing on women from Bryn Mawr College."

This longitudinal study uses new original firm-level panel data on offshoring of white collar administrative and technical jobs. Theory-guided field study of selected companies in the panel provides direct observation and description of underlying routines that make up absorptive capacity capability of firms. A series of case studies provides specific process description and expression of routines as input to the design of a new survey instrument specifically for measuring firm internal and external absorptive capacity. Two key research questions will be addressed econometrically. The first one is whether and how early and late adopters in same new offshoring business differ in terms of their absorptive capacity. The second one is whether successful early adopters of a new offshoring business practice exploit specific past experiences and develop certain absorptive capacity capabilities that enable them to persist in applying and innovating new offshoring business practices as offshoring of white collar jobs evolves over time and becomes an established industry practice. In addition the longitudinal panel data will also be used in developing heterogeneous diffusion models within sectors and across the entire population of organizations.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the research project. The project will build a community of researchers and practitioners for sharing best practices involving offshoring of white collar jobs while also advancing research on emergence and diffusion of offshoring and its associated organizational routines. The offshoring project findings have wider implications for sourcing and locating human capital anywhere in the world and for tracking the emergence of web based network organizational form. The research on unpacking black box of absorptive capacity has direct implications for advancing knowledge and managerial practices involving strategic renewal of companies and industries. Research findings will be disseminated through academic publications, the media, and CIBER-led National Forum on Trade Policy."

This diverse taxon consists of thousands of species, including both unicells and massive, complex multicellular organisms, representing an evolutionarily distinct lineage of autotrophs, separate from both the rhodophytic and chlorophytic lines. Chloroplast genomes have become a tool of choice in deciphering evolutionary relationships among terrestrial plant lineages, because they offer a straightforward and low cost means of obtaining numerous orthologous loci from a large number of taxa (compared to nuclear genome sequencing). For this reason, much of our knowledge concerning chloroplast genetic architecture and plastid-host gene transfer events is derived from the analysis of terrestrial plants. To date, only two chloroplast genomes have been published from the entire stramenopile lineage. The minimal size of this data set is surprising considering the seminal role stramenopiles provide in a variety of aquatic communities and their distinct taxonomic position. The goal of this research: to sequence chloroplast genomic DNA of ten stramenopiles. The targeted organisms represent nine of the recognized sixteen classes of stramenopiles. In addition to their taxonomic diversity, these algae differ extensively in morphology (encompassing unicells, colonial and macro algal forms) and have significant ecological or economic impact. Analysis of stramenopile chloroplasts via comparative genome sequencing will: (a) give insight into chloroplast evolutionary processes in this relatively unexplored autotrophic lineage; (b) generate a sequence database for use in the phylogenetic analysis of other stramenopiles; (c) enable the design of new primers to explore diversity or gene expression in natural populations of phytoplankton; (d) provide genetic tools for comparing chloroplast transcriptional programs (e.g., as cells are exposed to specific environmental challenges); (e) allow comparative analysis of structure/function relationships using biochemical and bioinformatic techniques. A web site dedicated to stramenopile chloroplast genomics will disseminate the data generated by the project and will also serve as an outreach vehicle for public education about this globally important group of algae."

Modeling research will focus on agent-based, dynamic data driven simulation models of transportation networks that adapt to real-time data feeds to predict future states of the system, and modeling of plume cloud dispersions that when integrated with transportation simulations, allow evaluation of the DDDAS approach in important<br/>emergency scenarios. Finally, a paradigm termed ad hoc distributed simulations will be explored that features dynamic collections of autonomous simulations interacting with each other and real-time data in a continuously running real-time distributed simulation environment.

Haldane), at least an inordinate fondness for the study of this species-rich and life-history diverse lineage of insects. A team led by Dr. Brian Farrell at Harvard University, Dr. Michael Whiting at Brigham Young University, and Dr. David Maddison at the University of Arizona, with colleagues from around the world, will conduct an extensive study of beetle (insect order Coleoptera) phylogeny to provide the first broad scale view of beetle diversification. With ca. 350,000 described species, beetles comprise a huge fraction of the world's biota and are dominant in every terrestrial ecosystem. Beetles represent the most diverse and rapid radiation of any terrestrial organismal group, yet we have only a rudimentary knowledge of their deeper level phylogeny, and still do not understand even their most basic patterns of diversity. Collectively, beetles represent nearly every feeding habit among insects including herbivory and fungivory (feeding upon fungi), saprophagy (feeding upon decaying matter), predation and parasitism, and a thorough study of their evolutionary history would provide insight into the role of feeding habits in species diversity. The team of 40 leading beetle researchers worldwide, with expertise in nearly every beetle lineage, proposes to construct a framework phylogeny (genealogical tree) for all beetles, utilizing a 3-tier approach. Tier 1: 54 exemplar species, representing all major beetle lineages, will be sampled extensively for character data (morphology plus 23kb of DNA sequence data including complete mitochondrial genomes) to provide a robust outline of the relationships among the major (superfamily) groups of beetles. Tier 2: 300 additional species will sampled for morphology and 12kb of sequence data to establish relationships among beetle families. Tier 3: 3000 additional species will be sequenced for 1.5 kb of DNA sequence data, with morphology added for a subset of these, to better characterize the grand diversity of beetle phylogeny at the subfamilial level. <br/>Novel bioinformatics tools will be developed to streamline data processing for the molecular and morphological data, and will allow for greater efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility of the data and associated results, while providing an online framework for collaboration by participants throughout the world. This represents the first time that coleopterists have collaborated on such a large-scale phylogenetic project, and the work should result in a robust estimate of beetle phylogeny that will provide a predictive basis for classification and integration of information on this ecologically and economically important group of insects. Information on all aspects of beetles will be disseminated through the Tree-of-Life website hosted at the University of Arizona, a traveling Spanish-language / English-language museum exhibit, and through publications and symposia. This research will provide training for graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students, including 10 female researchers and an undergraduate student with disabilities."

Following that upgrade, including development and application of real-time signal processing algorithms, the Fe, Ca, Ca+, and Na lidar systems are also upgraded.

One controversial area is the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast, where two contrasting models have persisted in the literature for decades and have seen renewed support from recent NSF-sponsored research. One model views sea level as continually rising through the last 6,000 to 7,000 years, whereas the other holds that sea level reached present elevations 6,000 to 7,000 years ago and has oscillated within 1 to 2 meters of present elevations since that time. Past research along the Gulf Coast has been undertaken in different areas and by different investigators using different methods. These conflicting models have not been reconciled, and it remains uncertain whether disparate results reflect inherent spatial variability in sea-level change, differences in resolution of the various methods used, or some combination of the two. This collaborative research brings together investigators that have produced conflicting results but who now will apply their respective approaches to the same field areas. The researchers will focus on non-subsiding, non-deltaic sites in southwestern Louisiana, Alabama, and northwestern Florida. Major goals of the project are (1) the documentation of Holocene (ground) water-level change from studies of basal peats in non-deltaic marsh sediments; (b) definition of precise sea-level indicators in modern chenier and beach-ridge deposits; and (c) tracking of changes in the elevation of sea-level indicators through time within chenier and beach ridge stratigraphic records. This approach is expected to produce high-resolution relative sea-level curves for each study area from basal-peat data and from chenier and beach-ridge deposits so as to reconcile the two approaches and provide an internally consistent picture of sea-level change and its spatial variability. Each curve will be calibrated to precise GPS elevations and will be anchored by radiocarbon and/or optically stimulated luminescence dating.<br/><br/>Development of a more precise and integrated understanding of relative sea-level change and its spatial variability along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast will have a number of disciplinary and regional implications. Existing models for sea-level change have significantly different implications for global climate and ice volume reconstructions as well as for studies of regional coastal landscape evolution, of human adaptations to past sea-level change, and of the ways that coastal systems might respond to future climate and sea-level change. Sea-level change is also one of the most pressing problems in human-environment interactions along the Gulf of Mexico coast, especially along the Mississippi delta, where billions of dollars will be invested in coastal restoration. At present, these efforts lack a fundamental baseline for natural background rates of sea-level change, its regional-scale spatial variability, and its recent trajectory. This research will provide such a baseline, and will be integrated with coastal restoration efforts."

The goal of this project is to examine the role of this mechanism in the acclimation of photosynthetic carbon fixation in marine diatoms to low CO2, and the modulation of this acclimation by light and nutrient limitation. Laboratory experiments will focus on quantifying C4 gene transcript abundances and enzyme activities in short-term experiments and in light-dark cycle and light- and nitrogen-limited cultures of model diatom species. Fieldwork will focus on examining the importance of the C4 concentrating mechanism and its regulation by CO2 in an upwelling region off the coast of Oregon characterized by a naturally wide range of CO2 concentrations. The field experimental approach will be to measure the sensitivities of photosynthetic carbon fixation in natural diatom populations to the inhibition of C4 enzymes, in relation to in situ and manipulated concentrations of CO2. The regulation of carbon fixation in marine diatoms by carbon dioxide (CO2) and the modulation of CO2 control by light and nutrients may affect ocean productivity, biological carbon export from surface waters and therefore the contribution of diatoms to global carbon cycling, and phytoplankton species composition. The results of this research will be of interest to oceanographers studying the controls of primary production and the biological carbon pump, geochemists interested in the use of stable carbon isotopes in diatom organic matter to understand current and historic productivity and climate change, and marine ecologists interested in the structure and evolution of phytoplankton communities. The project will support and train a graduate student as well as provide research opportunities for undergraduates. The researchers will also incorporate undergraduate students from the NSF-funded RIOS summer internship program into this project and will support the public outreach and education efforts of the newly established Mid-Atlantic Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence."

This site includes: an existing observing system with power and high bandwidth communications; a dynamic, highly permeable and biogeochemically active seafloor; is in close proximity to the deep ocean, which provides regular exposure to offshore geochemistry and variable physical forcing driven by internal tides and mesoscale eddies; a wide and predictable range of surface wave conditions; and the ability to forecast the arrival of significant surface wave events, thus greatly aiding the planning of experiments, deployment of instruments and implementation of event-driven sampling. The goal of the proposed research is to significantly advance the ability to measure transport of solutes into and out of permeable sediments, examine the seafloor's response to a wide range of physical oceanographic forcing, and determine the pelagic ecosystem response to these processes. The PIs propose to establish an array of physical sensors over depths of 10-40 m, collect high resolution temporal and spatial physical data over a range of oceanographic conditions; measure porewater concentrations of biogeochemically important constituents across the array; measure porewater exchange under a range of conditions, at both sandy and hard-bottom permeable seafloors; compare these porewater-seawater fluxes with those calculated using eddy correlation and water column profiling techniques; examine the optical (biological) response in the water column to physically driven sediment fluxes of nutrients; and determine the dynamics of the CO2 system in the surface water. Together, these tasks will enable them to resolve the physical and geochemical responses of benthic boundary layer systems in response to environmental changes."

Invasions of nonnative species not only have direct effects (competition, predation), but also indirect effects that cascade through food webs and into other ecosystems. For example, recent research in Japan showed that the indirect effects of nonnative invading rainbow trout on stream food webs reduced the amount of adult aquatic insects emerging from the stream and caused a 65% decline in streamside spiders. By extension, streamside birds also gain about 25% of their energy from emerging insects, so invading trout could affect them as well. This project will study the effect of nonnative brook trout invasions in Rocky Mountain streams, an even more widespread invasion that affects thousands of stream miles. This study will test whether these fish invaders have similar direct effects on native cutthroat trout as rainbow trout do on native fish in Japan. It will also examine whether these effects propagate through the stream food web and reduce emerging aquatic insects that feed streamside spiders. These effects will be measured directly and indirectly by using a stable isotope of nitrogen. This work will be performed in stream sections where nonnative brook trout are removed and compared to those where they have invaded, and along a gradient from central to northern Rocky Mountain streams. This study will have applied implications for the fisheries management of these stream systems."

All five universities are among the nation's leaders in awarding PhDs in the SBE fields to underrepresented minority students. The plan for the AC-SBE Alliance includes elements designed to help students at each step as they move from undergraduate school into graduate programs and onto the professoriate. The consortium has four objectives: (1) Recruit and prepare undergraduates to pursue a PhD in SBE fields, (2) Assist students in the transition from undergraduate to graduate study, (3) Retain PhD students and increase degree completion rates, and (4) Prepare future SBE faculty for success. Although each of the five schools in the AC-SBE alliance has unique features, the AC-SBE Alliance will include a number of overarching activities that will involve all five universities. For one example, the Alliance will build upon Howard University's Summer Institute that prepares future faculty in the STEM disciplines to launch a parallel SBE component. Also, entering AC-SBE students will be invited to participate in a one-week course Introduction to Data Analysis for the Social Sciences at the Odum Institute for Research in the Social Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Odum Institute will also offer a number of videoconference short courses for AC-SBE students. Efforts will be made to ensure that the students in the SBE Alliance have further opportunities to interact and network at conferences such as the NSF-supported EMERGE. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Through integrating the resources of the five AC-SBE Alliance institutions, AC-SBE will have a broad impact across a wide region of the country in the eventual production of SBE PhD recipients. Thus, AC-SBE will serve as a comprehensive project for recruiting, mentoring, and graduating URM students in SBE PhD programs, and to carry out strategies to identify and broadly support URM students who want to pursue graduate studies and academic careers. The norms of inclusiveness at the AC-SBE Alliance institutions and the relationships that have been forged will endure well past the termination of grant support to continue efforts to ensure the significant numbers of minority students pursue and receive PhD degrees and enter the professoriate."

Protostomes constitute more than one million of the 1.7 million named species of living organisms, including familiar animals such as mollusks, insects, earthworms, flatworms, roundworms, and many others of medical and economic importance. However, relationships among these groups are still contentious, so the backbone of the animal tree of life cannot currently be proposed without a large degree of uncertainty. This proposal will integrate and disseminate the broadest possible collection of information on selected representative animals to address questions of their origin and evolution over more than 540 million years. In order to do this we will integrate anatomical data on extant and extinct fauna with developmental data using cell-lineage studies and broad-based genomic information. Those data will be collected for a large pool of protostome species which will be studied at a level never before attempted in non-model organisms. The outcome of this research will contribute to rewriting what it is known about animal evolution.<br/> The awarded grant will contribute to the training of students at different academic levels, emphasizing underrepresented groups in science. Results will be disseminated to society through partnership with five of the most prominent natural history museums in the world, including the Harvard Museum of Natural History and the American Museum of Natural History in the USA, and the most important museums in Australia and Denmark.

Efficiency of the algorithms and underlying representations is the key to effectively using such databases. This research addresses efficiency issues from the perspective of applications in spatial and metric databases involving queries such as nearest neighbor finding. The goal is to speed up operations that arise in applications in computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), and computer vision that make use of large databases. The applications that are considered include the fast computation of point cloud models as well the efficient representation of data such as terrains via triangulations of the underlying surface. The implementation of such data in a distributed environment is also studied.<br/><br/>In this project we are investigating three related topics. First is computing k nearest neighbor joins for point cloud models in computer graphics applications. In particular, rather than computing the k nearest neighbors for each data point, we reuse the set of neighbors of the points for which we have already performed the task. The approach is to exploit the concept of locality of a given object q (e.g., a point, a block containing a query point, or an arbitrary object) in a search hierarchy defined to be the set of blocks which could contain the k nearest neighbors of q. We investigate this in the context of moving object databases where the query object is in motion while the remaining objects in the database are stationary (e.g., gas stations, buildings, restaurants, etc.). The goal is to determine the region that must be searched to find the k nearest neighbors of an object or objects whose motion is restricted to a particular region of space. We are devising efficient (possibly optimal) methods to compute the locality based on our incremental nearest neighbor algorithm. We explore computation of the Hausdorff distance that is used in computer vision and computer graphics. <br/>Second is an investigation of distributed spatial indexes for applications in P2P networks. The approach is to apply our incremental nearest neighbor algorithm in such an environment. We also extend CHORD method to provide key-based lookup service in a distributed spatial index in conjunction with a larger variety of spatial indexes. Additionally, we study the relationship of the CAN key-based lookup service to a quadtree. <br/>Third is in indexing triangulations. Triangulations are usually represented using a variant of an adjacency structure that stores the topological relations between the triangles. Finding the actual triangle that contains the query point requires the imposition of an index on the collection of triangles. We are devising a mathematical model that helps evaluate the efficiency of using a bucketing method based on the PM2 quadtree to store the triangulation. The model uses geometric probability."

Such a network is geometrically embedded with constant degree, and has links of different lengths such that number of nodes with a link of length x in a region of area A is proportional to A=2x. We begin our investigation by focusing on one example.<br/><br/>The Packed Exponential Connections (PEC) network is a grid-based network with connectivity and routing results that are competitive with hypercubic networks. The prior results are all empirical, since the structure of the network has only been understood through an indirect existence proof. In this research we will explore the first theoretical understanding of a PEC network. The preliminary work will be extended to incorporate the fundamental problems of routing and broadcasting; this will lead to broader question of the algorithmic utility of the PEC network, and exponential interconnection networks in general.<br/><br/>While the PEC network is deterministic an exponential interconnection networks can also be defined probabilistically. Such a network can and will be studied empirically and analytically; in any event, the PEC network gives a benchmark for comparisons.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this work can be seen both in the benefits of the research and the benefits for education. There is a need for a better understanding of networks in areas like ad hoc networks. In these areas the emphasis has been on simple issues like connectivity and hierarchical flow of information; we propose to study the properties of sparse networks that are better suited to algorithmic processing. The first step in this direction is the PEC networks. The educational benefits will be primarily in the involvement of students; a Ph.D. candidate is budgeted. This aspect of broader impact is particularly true for an SGER proposal, since it is always harder for a student to find support to work on high-risk subjects. It is important to train researchers to take risks. The desires of NSF to support underrepresented groups and undergraduate education will be kept in mind."

This project develops methods for reconstructing past water chemistry and food webs of lakes. The biological and chemical deposits in surface sediment samples will be compared with the water in 62 modern lakes. The resulting relationships will be tested by comparing sediment cores with 24 years of observations from the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research (NTL-LTER) site. The methods will then be used to reconstruct 150 years of history for several lakes, adding perspective to the long-term observations of the NTL-LTER and testing the prediction that lakes high in the local landscape had more severe and longer-lasting effects of 19th century logging than low lakes that are more influenced by groundwater. This research will also help to understand the response of lakes to severe droughts that last decades to centuries by identifying periods of low lake levels during the last 10,000 years. Understanding the variability of the responses of lakes to climate change and disturbance is essential to predicting the responses of particular lakes to future changes in land use and climate. <br/>This project will bring together expertise from several strong programs at the University of Wisconsin (the Center for Limnology, Botany, the Center for Climatic Research, NTL-LTER, and UW-LaCrosse), with the Limnological Research Center and LacCORE National Lacustrine Core Repository at the University of Minnesota and the United States Geologic Survey Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical Budgets (WEBB) project.

COSEE SE has a centralized administration with a full-time director and geographically distributed team members. Activities include: annual, week-long Ocean Leadership workshops for teachers and scientists at different marine labs in each state, Ocean Awareness Days at many small informal education sites in each state, team-based workshops for middle school teachers based on a curriculum specifically designed for coastal SC, NC and Georgia, workshops to promote the use of regional ocean observing data in classrooms, Coastal Legacy programs that use the local African American heritage to develop activities that will attract these students to marine science, a test of a middle school immersion program for marine science in two schools, and a well developed evaluation effort. COSEE SE provides a significant regional service as the hub of a network for the education and outreach efforts of regional research programs such as SEACOOS and sub-regional, ocean observing programs. The Center will continue to expand this responsibility by reaching out to additional science and education partners, adding them to the existing data base inventory, and helping them have some direct interaction with COSEE SE activities. COSEE SE's efforts will highlight research on the South Atlantic Bight, inventory diversity projects, develop curriculum, and connect to the national COSEE network. COSEE SE will also be an active participant in the national education network for IOOS. COSEE SE and COSEE MidAtlantic propose to develop and hold a workshop for scientists and educators to develop applications for the classroom using real-time SEACOOS data. In addition, new partnerships are proposed. These new partnerships are possible because of the networks established in the initial funding period.

During winter, the maximum amplitude of convection is located between the equator and 20 S, and is generally referred to as the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). Recent studies based on satellite data have shown that the intraseasonal activity in this region is associated with large sea surface temperature (SST) variability (up to 3 C), and it has been suggested that air-sea interaction plays an important role. Heretofore there have been only satellite data and numerical modelling used to investigate the variability in these regions. It is proposed to participate in a French Campaign the objective of which is to understand ocean-atmosphere coupling at the intraseasonal timescale in this region of the Indian Ocean, and to explain the mechanisms of the SST variability and its influence on the atmospheric evolution. Measurements will be made using the Air-Sea Interaction Profiler (ASIP), augmented with 5 Lagrangian floats, with 24-node temperature chains attached. ASIP, previsouly funded by the NSF Oceanographic Technology program, will provide profiles of temperature, conductivity, shear, fluorescence/turbidity, and PAR over the full depth of the mixed layer at sub-centimeter spatial resolution and repeat intervals of 5 minutes. This proposal will address the following fundamental problems: 1. the relative importance of local SST conditions and the diurnal cycle of the warm layer versus large scale atmospheric conditions 2. the biological contribution to heat trapping in the near-surface layer, and its role in the overall heat budget. The broader impacts of the objectives relate to climate change by addressing some of the issues pertinent to atmospheric convection in the Indian Ocean; the MJO interacts with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the monsoons, and extratropical weather, and therefore of global importance."

These wires are the bottleneck of circuit and system performance, as transistors are now so fast that it takes more time to transmit signals than to compute them. Core problems in physical design include the shaping and placement of both circuit components (""modules"") and the wires connecting them. As the size and complexity of integrated circuits continue to grow exponentially with Moore's Law to 10 to 100 million modules, so does the difficulty in achieving designs that meet required performance targets under various constraints, such as constraints on the maximum power or temperature. Sophisticated computer-aided design (CAD) software plays a vital role in VLSI design. The systematic procedures or ""algorithms"" from which this software is derived are at the center of efforts to improve the quality and efficiency of circuit designs. To be useful in practice, these algorithms must be scalable; i.e., their runtime increases at a modest rate, e.g., linearly, as the design size increases. Mathematical formulations have been used extensively for physical design problems, but most of them assume either that the modules are evenly distributed over the circuit or that they follow a pre-specified density profile. The focus of this research is on the development of mathematical models and techniques to support the development of practical algorithms for the more general physical-design setting in which no pre-specified density profile is available. Such a formulation is a much better reflection of the underlying physical design problem, as, for example, the temperature distribution will not be known a priori.<br/><br/>The broader impact of a high-quality scalable algorithm for placement optimization under generalized density inequalities would be considerable. Improved design algorithms produce more powerful circuitry. A scalable high-quality solver with physically accurate constraint modeling allows designers to integrate diverse circuit elements in complex ways. The resulting increase in computing power ultimately translates into new products, new markets, and new science. Ultimately, the vast size and complexity of nano-scale design problems can realistically be approached only by generic, scalable algorithms yet to be developed. The successful formulation of a truly scalable methodology for physically realistic VLSI designs can be expected to have lasting and far-reaching impact on future design paradigms."

The investigators will continue their agenda of integrating psychologically more realistic assumptions about human behavior into formal economic models, to modify and improve economic theory in those areas where it is most importantly inaccurate.<br/><br/>This award funds research exploring the implications of self-control problems for the interplay between what consumers buy and when they buy it. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is that it helps to further delineate the implications of basic lessons from psychology for basic economics. Indeed, the investigators revisit a core domain of economic behavior - consumer choice under budget constraints - with one of the<br/>simplest and most successful models from the emerging behavioral-economics literature - selfcontrol problems modeled as a time-inconsistent taste for immediate gratification. The analysis of consumer choice is both a good place to empirically identify the nature of people's self-control problems, and a realm where self-control problems might have some of their most profound effects.<br/><br/>The research has two main thrusts. The first studies the relationship between prices, quantity purchased, and timing of purchases for unhealthy goods. In particular, self-control problems can lead to responses to non-linear prices or price variation that would not arise for those without self-control problems. For instance, consumers who don't fully anticipate their future selfcontrol problems may take insufficient advantage of low prices or bulk purchasing, and hence end up spending more than necessary for their purchases.<br/><br/>The second thrust concerns the relationship between the timing of total consumptions expenditures and the composition of that spending. Goods differ in terms of when they deliver utility. Some goods, such as restaurant meals and entertainment, deliver mostly short-term pleasure. Other goods, such as TVs, bicycles, and other durables, deliver both short-term and long-term pleasure.  And many goods have consequences beyond the direct pleasure from consumption. For instance, potato chips, soda, or other unhealthy goods can create negative future consequences, while exercise, investment in cultural skills, and social networking can create positive future consequences. <br/><br/>The investigators show how the exact timing of when goods deliver pleasure and pain is far more important for people with self-control problems than those without, and how the availability and preferences regarding these different types of goods can dramatically change both the behavioral and welfare implications of self-control problems for the timing of consumption. The investigators intend to study how the common worry by economists about distortions in a person's overall spending and savings ought be supplemented or modified in light of concerns about what bundles of goods are being purchased.<br/><br/>In fact, among the broader impacts of this research is that it can help move economics to more realistic analysis of policies designed to address savings behavior, credit-card borrowing, overconsumption of unhealthy goods, obesity, and similar phenomena. While the research itself is preliminary and theoretical, the investigators hope that by combining the many insights of rational choice economics with the acknowledgment that people might have limits to their self-control, this research will improve the contribution economics can make to policy analysis in these areas.<br/>1<br/><br/>"

Animated agents are anthropomorphic software objects in the user interface that, in their most advanced implementations, produce gestures, display facial expressions, and move their eyes in coordination with their speech. They have been shown to improve user performance in some task domains (e.g. tutoring). When might this technology help or hurt survey data quality and respondents' satisfaction? How sophisticated must the agents be in order to provide benefit--or harm? In a web survey, an agent might motivate respondents to participate and complete the task, much like human interviewers do, and help respondents understand the survey questions as intended while allowing respondents to participate at their convenience, as in ordinary web surveys. On the other hand, the presence of an agent might discourage honest responding to questions about sensitive topics, much as human interviewers have been shown to do. In this project a series of laboratory experiments examine more and less human-like agents that ask questions about respondents' sensitive and non-sensitive behaviors. The studies contrast data quality and user satisfaction in non-agent web surveys to those with interface agents that vary in their dialogue capability, the degree to which they provide visual and spoken cues about their internal states, and the degree of intentionality in their speech. The agents are simulated with software that converts a video image of a live interviewer into an animation in real time; respondents thus believe they are interacting with a computer-generated agent even though there is actually a human behind the ""agent."" In the experiments about non-sensitive behaviors, respondents answer on the basis of fictional scenarios so that the accuracy of their answers can be determined. One possible outcome is that agents with greater dialogue capability will promote interactions that lead to more accurate understanding and thus more accurate answers. In the experiments about sensitive behaviors, respondents answer about their own lives; more reports of sensitive behaviors indicate greater respondent candor. One possible outcome is that agents with more movement (lips, eyes, and eyebrows) will lead respondents to feel less private and therefore to answer less candidly than with agents whose movement is limited. Respondents' satisfaction is measured with a post-interview questionnaire; the impact of different agent features on how respondents communicate with the survey system is measured by detailed turn-by-turn coding of all dialogue.<br/><br/>The practical impact of this work will be more informed decisions by survey researchers in adopting agent technology. Knowing when agents help and what features help the most can focus decisions about what interfaces to develop and which ones not to develop. For example, if dialogue capability is more important to data quality and user satisfaction than other agent features, this could focus future development efforts on conversational competence of agents more than on visual realism. The theoretical impact of the proposed work will be in two areas. First, it will deepen our understanding of how verbal and non-verbal communication are interconnected, for example how verbal interaction is affected by the fidelity of the agents' facial display. Second, by comparing human-computer and human-human interaction the project will advance knowledge of how attributions of intentionality and human agency affect interaction more generally. This research is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology."

All five universities are among the nation's leaders in awarding PhDs in the SBE fields to underrepresented minority students. The plan for the AC-SBE Alliance includes elements designed to help students at each step as they move from undergraduate school into graduate programs and onto the professoriate. The consortium has four objectives: (1) Recruit and prepare undergraduates to pursue a PhD in SBE fields, (2) Assist students in the transition from undergraduate to graduate study, (3) Retain PhD students and increase degree completion rates, and (4) Prepare future SBE faculty for success. Although each of the five schools in the AC-SBE alliance has unique features, the AC-SBE Alliance will include a number of overarching activities that will involve all five universities. For one example, the Alliance will build upon Howard University's Summer Institute that prepares future faculty in the STEM disciplines to launch a parallel SBE component. Also, entering AC-SBE students will be invited to participate in a one-week course Introduction to Data Analysis for the Social Sciences at the Odum Institute for Research in the Social Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Odum Institute will also offer a number of videoconference short courses for AC-SBE students. Efforts will be made to ensure that the students in the SBE Alliance have further opportunities to interact and network at conferences such as the NSF-supported EMERGE. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Through integrating the resources of the five AC-SBE Alliance institutions, AC-SBE will have a broad impact across a wide region of the country in the eventual production of SBE PhD recipients. Thus, AC-SBE will serve as a comprehensive project for recruiting, mentoring, and graduating URM students in SBE PhD programs, and to carry out strategies to identify and broadly support URM students who want to pursue graduate studies and academic careers. The norms of inclusiveness at the AC-SBE Alliance institutions and the relationships that have been forged will endure well past the termination of grant support to continue efforts to ensure the significant numbers of minority students pursue and receive PhD degrees and enter the professoriate."

Currently, decision-makers must rely on subjective evaluation that tends to be heavily weighted toward opinion and anecdotal evidence. While no one can claim that this practice is the sole source of a multifaceted traffic safety problem, statistics suggest that current practice needs to be studied and improved. Over 40,000 people have died on U.S. roadways each year for the past forty years. This research aims to provide an objective, analytic foundation for handling uncertainty and risk in the context of traffic safety by introducing a proactive, collaborative decision-making process. Our goals, for both local and national jurisdictions, are (1) to develop an analytical model for mining crash and traffic data, (2) to develop a Highway Safety Manual (HSM), a comprehensive catalog of procedures and information for conducting performance-based crash studies, and (3) to bring analytic objectivity into the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) decision-making process. Two key activities are to develop crash analysis models and procedures that can (a) confidently identify hazardous roadways and (b) accurately predict performance at treated sites. Statistical learning techniques will be used to classify roadways into useful categories and to calibrate, assess and select models that can be used for planning roadways with maximum safety. A safety standard and a failure probability model -- the failure to satisfy the standard -- will be an integral part of the performance-based crash analyses process and should be an effective risk communication device, especially when the process requires public participation. Ultimately, our goal is a working HSIP decision-making process applicable to all traffic areas in the United States, accepted on its merits -- one that meets the demand for a proactive and collaborative decision-making process and satisfies a great national need. A successful transition to our HSIP process hinges on stakeholder adoption. Therefore, the third key activity consists of strengthening and expanding partnerships among stakeholders with different technical backgrounds, experience, and philosophies by conducting three workshops: (1) stakeholder perceptions on road safety, (2) risk analysis perspectives, and (3) forming a strategic relationship."

Hunting practices in particular among many indigenous groups are probably strongly regulated by internal controls, based on a combination of spiritual beliefs (cosmology), social rituals, and natural history knowledge. Despite the evidence for the key role of cosmology in regulating resource use, most work on game overexploitation and the abandonment of traditional hunting practices by indigenous peoples, particularly in the Neotropics of Central America and northern South America, has focused on the effects of market integration and ignored spiritual and other cultural practices. This research project will test the fundamental hypothesis that retention of traditional practices and cosmology by indigenous societies buffers them against the process of integration into the national society, thereby preventing biodiversity and ecosystem degradation by the indigenous societies themselves. This hypothesis will be evaluated by quantifying resource-use practices and biodiversity status among communities of one ethnic group that differ in their degree of retention of traditional cosmology and practices. The project will be based in the 1.7 million-hectare Raposa Indigenous Area in the northern Brazilian Amazon. The dynamics of hunting by the Macuxi people of this region offer an excellent system for bridging theory and practice in the study of complexity. Hunting practices and degree of integration to Brazilian society vary among 206 villages distributed across the heterogeneous landscape in Raposa. A mechanistic model of animal population dynamics and human hunting practices will be developed and tested using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Socioeconomic data, wildlife data, and remotely sensed data will be collected, integrated, and analyzed within a geographic information system. In addition to a better understanding of human-biodiversity linkages in indigenous areas, outcomes of this project will include (1) educational materials for the Macuxi and the institutions that work with them, (2) a distance-linked graduate seminar in which students collaborate across departments, campuses and disciplines, (3) broadening of the participation of women and minority students in science, and (4) enhancement of the infrastructure for science by linking institutions with different areas of specialty into a teaching and research network that will benefit students who would normally have access only to their own institution.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the development of effective development policies and biodiversity conservation and will help provide theoretical background for coupled human-natural systems in the subsistence or semi-subsistence societies that characterize much of tropics. Research results will be relevant to discussions on the role of overkill by low technology hunters in Pleistocene extinctions and the synergistic effects of environmental conditions and forms of social organization and decision making on the intensity of natural resource depletion. The results will be particularly germane for the ongoing debate on the role of ""people in parks"" and on the contribution that indigenous peoples will make to biodiversity conservation worldwide. The geographical location of this study is significant unto itself. Roraima covers a large portion of the unstudied and largely unmanaged high diversity Guiana Shield forest-savanna transition. The area, which grades from dry savannas through mesic and wet forests to montane cloud forest and tepui habitats, represents one of the last wilderness areas on Earth. For this key ecological area, the future of biodiversity lies in the hands of indigenous peoples. This study will provide key insights regarding how the internal cultural dynamics of indigenous societies influence and are influenced by biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function, with implications for human-environment interactions in Raposa and elsewhere where indigenous peoples retain an important presence. This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems."

However, this trend is somewhat reversed during the post-socialist era since market transition. That is, women re-embrace the gender ""separate-sphere"" ideology, identify more with their activities at home than at work, and devote a greater portion of their time to household tasks than to paid work compared with the past. What has happened to make the reversal possible? What is the role of the changing workplace in transforming meanings of work for women and impacting women's reconstruction of family roles? And what does it suggest about changing state-citizen relations? The PI' attempts to address the above questions in collaboration with Yongping Jiang, Senior researcher from Women's Studies Institute of China. <br/><br/>Using in-depth interviews and observations of urban women, the present study will try to understand women's family orientation formed in everyday life in large contexts of China's market reform and globalization. It will pay close attention to how women's gender ideology, identity, and deep feelings are affected by changes in state welfare/employment policies, work environment, and their interactions with workplace leaderships. It will also take the within-case, cross-case, and cross-generation approaches to compare the similarities and differences of women's experiences across historical period, work environment, and generation. <br/><br/>The PIs will recruit, in the city of Beijing, approximately 100 married women coming of age in the socialist and post-socialist eras, who either currently hold a job or had ever worked in the past but are under the official retirement ages. The sample will be drawn by the ""maximizing range"" technique through the PIs' broad personal and professional networks. The subsample size for the socialist and post-socialist cohorts will be equally divided. For the purpose of comparison, a supplemental sample of six to ten cases will also be drawn from Nanjiecun, Henan Province, in which the Maoist socialist system still prevails. <br/><br/>Data collection will involve in-depth interviews with urban women and, where appropriate, their spouses, and co-workers, to be conducted in the summer and fall of 2005. The questions will focus on how women form their gender ideologies, identities and divide family tasks, and how women's diverse/changing work experiences, together with other factors (e.g. persistence of traditional culture, marital happiness), have contributed to the congruence and incongruence of those ideology, identity and performance. <br/><br/>Some intended scholarly contributions include (1) enriching gender theories by placing women's domestic orientation in the nexus of manifold, interwoven historical, institutional, and global forces, (2) enhancing the validity of the qualitative data and measurement of variables in future quantitative research by employing multiple sources and temporal organization of data, by emphasizing historic, institutional, and global connectedness in data collection, and (3) providing points of comparison for future cross-cultural comparative studies and more globally integrated analyses on gender, class, and state-citizen relations by introducing a Chinese case. <br/><br/>It will have broad impacts on (1) higher education through the increased breath of theory and of methodology, disseminated through publications, teaching, and student training in research, (2) feminist movements which may incorporate diverse agendas for women facing various forms of oppression in varying situations and historical moments, (3) Chinese state policies on welfare in general and on women's employment in particular, (4) the public understanding, in the U.S. as well as in other parts of the world, of the evolvement of social justice systems regarding gender and class in state socialist countries like China, and of China's global connectedness."

In particular, UND is using (1) TA training materials, (2) more effective collaborative problem-solving lab instruction, (3) a version of PSL manuals for non-majors customized for UND, (4) a computerized pre-lab quiz system. The project aims to increase the impact of laboratory exercises on student learning by enforcing more active student involvement. The project is being evaluated by an evaluator at another neighboring university. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the activity is that it is investigating the impact on student learning of changing the laboratory instruction system and thus evaluating the PSL system in the context of another state university with different infrastructure and different constraints. It does this by comparing against a baseline that has already been developed. The project addresses weaknesses uncovered by student surveys with content retention questions, student assessment and other measures. The new system applies leverage to get at these fundamental points. Its effectiveness is amenable to quantitative measurement. The project is a large-scale attempt to bring about improvement through systemic change.<br/><br/>Broader impact of the project is that all service courses come under a cycle of measurement-based incremental improvement. Working with U of M and UMC is particularly beneficial for gaining a knowledge base for developing K-12 physics teacher training courses and workshops and also for development of effective distance learning courses.<br/><br/>The expectations for student comprehension are raised, and labs are coordinated more closely with lectures. Computerized pre-lab quizzes, if successful, could generalize to wider application in the curriculum. The degree to which the implementation succeeds at UND (not untypical of many Midwestern universities) will be analyzed and a report submitted for publication. The project has direct impact on the involvement of women in the department (25% of GTAs and the project coordinator). Curriculum materials are available in public domain via the internet."

Since penetration to the storm core or eye-wall is a nonlinear mixing problem, the investigators intend to apply methods from dynamical systems theory to help them understand transport and mixing processes, both on the scale of the eye/eye-wall system with its mesovortices in the eye-wall, and on the scale of the vortex as a whole.  Part of the motivation for this work is that existing theory for maximum wind intensity, based on assumptions of axisymmetry can significantly under-predict the intensities seen in high-resolution numerical models of hurricanes.  The formation of eye-wall mesovorticies and latent heat release from moist air transported asymmetrically into the hurricane eye-wall may help explain this difference.<br/><br/>The work to be done includes analyzing output from high-resolution hurricane simulations to determine distinguished hyperbolic orbits and their stable and unstable manifolds, implementing new methods for analyzing Lagrangian mixing, finding low-dimensional approximations to phases of hurricane evolution, and a search for a set of parameters that may be used to predict maximum wind intensity.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that the results of this theoretical work will help in the design of future field experiments, contribute to a better understanding of the processes responsible for fluctuations in hurricane intensity, and provide a basis for better predictions of hurricane intensity."

Recently, financial markets have been observed contributing to social cognition as well. Information is transmitted, problem solving is influenced, and individual inference is affected. The mechanics by which financial markets contribute to social cognition are not well understood. Neoclassical economic theory assumes that market participants can rationally infer information from others through transaction prices. But the very rationality on which such inference is based should make market participants wary of trading. Unfortunately, if there is no trade, there are no transaction prices, and hence, nothing is revealed. Social cognition is impossible.<br/><br/>People trade -- in fact they trade a lot -- but we do not know why. Correlation analysis of order and trade flows and subsequent actions has not provided much insight. Nor have surveys helped much, suggesting that actions may be largely sub-conscious. If so, direct measurement of sub-conscious changes in perceived risk and reward may be a necessary first step towards resolving the trading puzzle and eventually understanding the role of asset markets in social cognition. Recently, scientists have discovered how changes in expected reward and risk induces specific responses in certain sub-cortical parts of the brain. The PIs plan to reverse this approach, exposing subjects to market activity while monitoring brain activity. The goal is to detect features in order and trade flows that trigger changes in perceived risk and reward as reflected in brain activity. The approach borrows from the neuroscience of vision, where scientists have successfully been able to identify the sources of changes in visual perception even in environments as complex as full-feature movies."

It is not known, for example, whether an insect picked at random from a tropical rainforest is more likely to be a generalist, feeding on numerous plant species, or a specialist that is fully dependent on a single plant species. This information is needed to predict the vulnerability of insect species to extinction resulting from the fragmentation and loss of tropical ecosystems. This study is one of the most comprehensive surveys of plant-herbivore interactions in the tropics, focusing on several ecological groups (guilds) of insect herbivores that feed on the foliage and wood of numerous tree species in the lowland rainforest of Papua New Guinea. The investigators expect to document the larval stages, host associations and parasitoids of approximately 1,000 insect species feeding on the most common tree species in young and mature rainforests. All woody plants in four hectares of forest, two of each forest type, will be inventoried, and insects will be reared from the vegetation. The investigators will test differences between forest types in host specificity and species richness to understand the assembly of plant-insect food webs after disturbance. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this activity include the strengthening of international scientific collaboration, the training of a new generation of tropical biologists, and the collection of data for tropical forest management and policy making. The project involves underrepresented Pacific Islanders in scientific research through student training and citizen scientists (parataxonomists). It builds capacity for entomology and botany in New Guinea by strengthening a local research station and developing national plant and insect collection. Results can be applied to developing conservation strategies for New Guinea, one of the top three remaining tropical wilderness areas in the world."

Executives recognize these needs. A critical factor in organizational<br/>competitiveness has become the speed at which innovations can be implemented. While fostering good ideas and producing innovation is central to business success, the speed of execution in today's organizations has become the differentiating factor that provides competitive advantage and is far from assured, as the Gartner Group has observed. Innovations gain their greatest value when they are actually used. Researchers in information systems in particular, have begun to recognize the importance of better alignment between information technology infrastructure and business systems. IT professionals are also recognizing the utility of diffusion of innovation theory to study implementation problems. However, despite the ubiquity and sophistication of IT, organizations have not taken advantage of the capabilities inherent in the information system itself as a method to manage implementation in diffusion networks. The primary objective of this study is to develop and test diffusion theories in IT-driven global organizations by collecting data which flows through a company's information technology infrastructure to study innovations of different kinds and to display diffusion patterns and networks dynamically in a ""digital diffusion dashboard"". Data on the innovations will be collected through automated electronic means, for example, through log files of who visits Web sites and what links they click on at what times. The innovations themselves involve a traceable electronic trail. For example, an innovation may be a new software tool allowing the placement of a ""tag"" within the tool for electronic tracking to determine when the tool is adopted and by whom. The research will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team of scholars in business anthropology, communication, adult education and engineering in partnership with information technology professionals from three major global corporations in the automotive industry: Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation, and DaimlerChrysler Corporation that serve as the research sites for this study. The Automotive Industry Action Group will help disseminate widely the findings and deliverables from this study. The IBM Corporation, as a partner in the study, will provide both IT and research expertise.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will accelerate theoretical progress in the study of diffusion of<br/>innovations in global networked organizations by: 1) developing a digital diffusion database of a range of<br/>innovations (30 - 60) across three organizations, 2) modeling each diffusion curve with statistical estimation techniques and clustering these curves to identify types of innovation diffusion patterns, 3) correlating characteristics of the innovations, communication about them, and communication network variables with the diffusion curve types, and 4) developing generalizations about diffusion in IT-based environments that can stimulate theory and lead to future hypotheses testing. The research is an integrative effort that advances dynamic multilevel modeling of diffusion patterns and social networks as they co-evolve over time. The research opens new frontiers in our understanding of the relationship between technology and the human and social dynamics of change.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The study will advance the practice of organizational change and help accelerate the<br/>diffusion of innovations by investigating, documenting and validating a new methodology using existing<br/>information technology network infrastructure, and by developing techniques to dynamically plan, monitor and manage the diffusion of innovations and organizational change in real time. Simple, clear and reusable indicators for a ""digital diffusion dashboard"" will open a new frontier for both scholars and practitioners alike. Researchers and managers will be able to leverage a company's data resources and visually monitor the diffusion network as it emerges as well as to monitor the consequences of implementation efforts during the diffusion process. While the ""dashboard"" tools will be developed in the context of the automobile industry, it will have wide applicability and benefit in many other public and private sectors, such as healthcare, retail, government and technology."

The proposed mobile symbol recognition technology will enable many opportunities for mobile e-commerce by recognizing bar codes, text on documents and user-customizable icons that are used to carry and convey information. To address these opportunities, technical challenges associated with limited processing power and memory resources, lower-quality optics in cameras, varying available network bandwidth, and the diversified development platforms they represent must be overcome. The advances proposed include the ability to unwarp images to account for distortions due to perspective imaging and lenses, removing imaging artifacts such as non-uniform lighting and highlights, deblurring images caused by fixed focus and motion, and improving the image contrast all within the resource constraints of the mobile devices. Recognition algorithms in the system must be able to automatically identify and decode various barcodes symbologies, handle multiple languages and fonts for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and be trainable for user customizable icons. Special consideration must be given to cross platform development so algorithms can be efficiently and robustly embedded in different development platforms. <br/><br/>The ability to perform image processing and pattern recognition algorithms on diversified handheld devices will provide advances in fields such as computer vision, mobile computing, and software engineering. This concept is powerful in that it requires no new infrastructure, since it uses popular mobile devices, and existing symbols such as barcode tags, text, and user-customizable icons. The downloadable symbol recognition component will enable many applications. Other than service providers and OEMs, merchants, advertisers, information providers and other service providers are likely partners and customers for our technology. Finally, the technology can be used to help disadvantaged groups (handicapped or visually impaired, for example) get access to product information (prescription drug instructions, for example) or transact commerce activity conveniently, using a device they may already have, or that is easily acquired. These include applications in medical care delivery, military applications, sign recognition for the visually challenged, and others."

It has received much less<br/>attention in oceanography probably because it is generally thought to occur only for anticyclonically (clockwise) sheared parallel flows or anticyclones of strengths not typically observed in the ocean. However, there are many observations of anticyclonic currents in the ocean that are marginally stable, and this suggests that inertial instability may be the primary mechanism by which anticyclonic shear and anticyclonic vortices are maintained at stable or marginally stable values. <br/><br/>The criterion for inertial instability is often quoted as Rossby number less than minus one, where a negative Rossby number implies anticyclonic flow However this criterion applies only to flows in homogeneous fluids like the mixed layer with no vertical shear In stratified flow that is vertically sheared as is commonly the case inertial instability can also occur with Rossby numbers between -1 and 0. Furthermore, even cyclonically sheared flows or cyclonic vortices for which Ro is greater than zero can be inertially unstable if the vertical shear is strong enough. It is also interesting that this instability can occur when the Richardson number is well above a quarter that is, in flows that are stable to the Kelvin Helmholtz instability, a controlling factor in oceanic flows. In other words, flows that are stable with regard to the well known Richardson number criterion can, in fact, be unstable because of inertial instability. It is therefore possible that inertial instability is frequently a controlling factor in oceanic flows without having been recognized as such. This renewal proposal will continue studies of inertial instability with the object of providing a fundamental basis for understanding the role that inertial instability plays in the worlds oceans. Under prior NSF funding, the investigators have performed a systematic numerical study of the effect of varying basic parameters on the inertial instability of idealized model vortices with no vertical shear and with weak vertical shear. In addition, the resulting analytical model, based on plane parallel horizontally sheared flow, is able to explain and predict much of the fundamental results of the numerical studies. From these investigations, there are now guidelines for exploring further. The previous studies will be extended to much more realistic models of oceanic vortices. Through a series of numerical simulations the effects of inertial instability will be studied in a variety of model vortices over a wide range of the essential parameters.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: By undertaking our investigation of inertial instability, we hope to improve our understanding of the role that inertial instability plays in stabilization and maintenance of oceanic currents and eddies.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: As a broader impact, these studies should provide guidance for those attempting to develop parameterizations for ocean models and criteria for determining likely locations for intense internal wave generation and inertial instability. Because of the intrinsically small vertical scales of inertial instability, it is usually not resolved by ocean models. Thus, the simulated flows can become and stay inertially unstable. This unphysical behavior must be corrected to maintain currents in the models at physically realizable levels, but a proper parameterization of the effects of the instability can be obtained only through increased understanding. This collaborative research project will foster an international collaboration with professor Orlandi at the University of Rome and one of his graduate students."

Previous work in two major polynyas (not influenced by rivers) showed that the flux of organic matter from the photic zone is high, yet strongly attenuated in the ""twilight zone."" Separate microbial work showed that sinking particles are colonized by an abundance of active bacteria, with hydrolytic activities as high in subzero waters as in warmer seas. Little information exists on specific bacteria associated with particles in the twilight zone of Arctic (or other marine) waters, with virtually none on how microbial diversity may relate to carbon flux in the ocean's interior or to differing inputs of marine and terrestrial carbon. This comparative research in several of the major polynyas of the Arctic system (two river-influenced, one not), in the same season over successive years, will help to develop a broader perspective on the possible changes in carbon cycling likely to result from a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean. The proposed research plan will characterize by modern molecular (or any) techniques the microbial communities that play a role in attenuating carbon flux. The success of this combined approach may prove valuable to evaluating aspects of carbon cycling elsewhere in the world oceans. Both principal investigators are dedicated educators, as well as researchers.

Ob-servations of building performance included building punching, bearing failure, and lateral shifting of buildings. Although much has been learned, significant uncertainty exists in the evaluation of these case histories, which has hampered back-analyses and the development of improved analytical methods. Key sources of uncertainty are the characteristics of the ground motions, lack of documentation of the se-quence of liquefaction, ground failure and building performance, and the inherent variability of ground conditions. Centrifuge testing, where the input motion, ground conditions, and ground/structural response can be carefully tracked, followed by advanced back-analyses of these models are warranted to advance the profession's understanding of ground failure and its resulting impact on structures. <br/><br/>Through the proposed research, a series of well documented model ""case histories"" of building per-formance at sites undergoing severe and moderate ground failure are developed by using the UC Davis large centrifuge. Soil-foundation-structure-interaction is a key NEESR research priority that is addressed through this centrifuge testing of different building systems on various ground conditions. It is of para-mount importance, because ground failure appeared to be caused in part due to the dynamic response of the overlying structures, and building damage was clearly linked to ground response. <br/><br/>Additionally, the poorly understood seismic response of silt will be explored in some of these ex-periments, as opposed to continuing efforts over the past decade to test just clean uniform sands in centri-fuge experiments. The relative importance of the thickness of the liquefiable soil layer and its density will be explored, while examining the interacting effects of different buildings and foundation conditions on the response of the liquefiable soil and building performance. <br/><br/>As part of this project, a focused ""Student Earthquake Engineering Symposium"" (SEES) that reaches out to high school students, with an emphasis on minority students, is created. The outreach program utilizes a strategy that has worked well for the sciences for the last 43 years in Northern California. Many high school students already participate in their schools' science fairs. By channeling their interests and their teachers' interests on the challenging problems involved in earthquake hazard mitigation, we can excite the next generation of earthquake engineers and scientists. <br/><br/>As emphasized in NRC(2003), ""NEES should be used to move past the prediction of free field liquefaction to the next level, which would be the ability to predict deformations ... for structures ... by considering the timing, sequence, and location of soil strength loss in the vicinity of the constructed feature."" The first step towards this goal is the generation of well documented ""case histories"" of building response on liquefied ground, which these carefully performed centrifuge model tests will achieve. These illustrative model studies will also offer emergency managers and teachers a dramatic alternative to currently existing static pictures of tilted buildings. Video clips augmented with animated measured response data will allow the seismic hazard of liquefaction and its effect on buildings to come alive."

These two parameters are difficult to predict in large part because biological effects fundamentally impact them over short temporal and spatial scales, and the physical and biological effects rapidly feedback on each other. This study proposes to place real-time remote observing platforms at locations of contrasting benthic physical disturbance that are characterized by strong gradients in benthic ecology, seabed characteristics and suspended particle properties. A combination of acoustic and video imaging of the seabed and lower water column will, in real time, identify changes in biologic activity, deposition, erosion, suspended sediment properties and/or bedform evolution that, in turn, trigger or otherwise indicate changes in bed erodability. Rapid response cruises employing real-time shipboard surveys will track events, directly measuring the short time-scale evolution of erodability, key physical and geochemical properties, and biological activity and assemblages. Open source numerical modeling of bed evolution, erosion and deposition, and water column processes will be coupled to the observing effort and will fundamentally advance predictability of fine sediment transport. The proposed study area, which leverages significant real-time observing efforts underway in the York River estuary and Lower Chesapeake Bay, has key properties in common with energetic, high sediment load shelves around the world which play essential roles in the global sediment and carbon cycles. In such systems, the nature of benthic biological activity, suspended particle properties and associated biological-physical feedbacks are tied to evolving salinity fronts and spatial and temporal gradients in physical disturbance. This is also commonly the case along major estuaries in the US and worldwide. Regardless of the locale, prediction of fine sediment transport relies critically on understanding controls on bed erodability and particle settling. This proposal hypothesizes that the evolution of bed erodability and suspended aggregates of fine sediment is distinctly different under biologically vs. physically dominated conditions. This proposal predicts that with increased biological activity, bed erodability will be greater and decrease less strongly with depth, but suspended aggregates will be larger and stronger due to small-scale biological binding. Under physically dominated conditions, erodability will increase suddenly with deposition, but decrease more quickly with time and depth due to rapid consolidation. Under physical dominance, suspended aggregates/flocs will be smaller and weaker, have smaller fall velocities, and decrease in size with increased stress due to breakup by shear."

This is indispensable for environmental applications, where models are imperfect and measurements are limited and uncertain. A key part of environmental DDDAS is data assimilation, broadly defined as the process of estimating the state of a system using all relevant information. This project will develop a new approach to data assimilation that makes better use of observations to deal with model imperfections. This new approachwill be developed in the context of mesoscale weather, such as thunderstorms, squall-lines, hurricanes, precipitation, and fronts. In these situations, forecast errors occur in both position (""the storm is in the wrong place"") and amplitude (""forecast winds are off""). Position errors are particularly important since they degrade our ability to predict storm tracks, issue warnings, and properly target observation platforms such as aircraft. Current assimilation methods have problems dealing with position errors. Instead of correcting these errors directly, they tend to compensate for them by distorting amplitudes. Distorted amplitude estimates can produce poor forecasts. Poor forecasts are a problem in their own right but, in the case of an environmental DDDAS, they can easily make strategies for gathering new observations ineffective. In this new formulation for data assimilation accounts for errors in both position and amplitude. This leads to a minimization algorithm that can be expressed in two steps: a regularized variational alignment problem and an amplitude adjustment problem. Alignment can be formulated with or without feature detection, it maintains dynamical consistency, and it permits the smoothness of the solution to be systematically controlled. Field alignment should significantly advance the state of DDDAS for environmental problems.<br/><br/>This work will lead to better analysis of mesoscale weather, especially hurricanes and severe storms. It turns out that expressing errors in terms of position and amplitude is quite general. Thus, from the perspective of DDDAS, this work will provide new ways to deal with model error in applications as diverse as hydrology, ecology, and oceanography. Field alignment also nicely complements existing amplitude-oriented assimilation methods used in operational weather forecasting centers. Finally, the regularization aspects of this work will also advance the state of the art in alignment methods, which will benefit biomedical imaging and object recognition research."

In addition to the research described above, the fellowship will also include a training component. Halverson will sit in on classes and seminars and hold formal and informal discussions with Limerick and other scholars at the University of Colorado's Center for the American West. <br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>Every year, state agencies stock tens of millions of fish into the freshwaters of the United States for the benefit of recreational anglers. Such stocking programs, ongoing for more than 100 years, have proven enormously successful socially and economically. However, stocking and other associated techniques have also had severe consequences for native fauna and ecosystems ,especially in the American West. About 37 percent of North American freshwater fishes are currently classified as vulnerable, imperiled, or extinct by The Nature Conservancy, and introduced species were at least partially responsible for 68 percent of the extinctions through predation, competition, the spread of disease, and hybridization. Other fisheries management techniques, including the use of fish poisons and the introduction of invertebrate prey species, have also had dire consequences for native fauna. Fisheries managers, scientists and other stakeholders appear to have divided into polarized factions over these fisheries management issues, generating increasingly rancorous debate over the effects and future direction of freshwater fisheries management. While the debate is couched largely in terms of contemporary science and social science, the roots of the conflict stretch deep into the past. Indeed, throughout its history, sport fishing has had a profound influence on freshwater ecosystems in ways that have often been controversial as well as beneficial and detrimental to the native inhabitants. This study is both timely and relevant. Although every bit as consequential, freshwater fisheries management has received little attention compared to other issues like the crises in marine and anadromous fisheries. An in-depth analysis of the current and historical roots of the controversy will also illuminate broader issues about the role of science and technology in society.<br/>Broader Impacts<br/> The proposed research will have broader impacts. Halverson, a former journalist, proposes to write a book that would be accessible and of interest to the general public. The potential audience is large; nationwide about one in seven adults spend some of their leisure time fishing. In addition, by pulling together information about history, science and politics into one body of work, the proposed research would further debate and thereby improve the management of the nation's freshwaters."

In other words, they are made up of many microscopic crystals held together by grain boundaries. It is widely recognized that the types of grain boundaries in a material and the manner in which they are connected affect a wide range of properties and, ultimately, a material's performance and lifetime. In most cases, however, our ability to predict and control the materials properties that are governed by the grain boundaries is severely limited by our incomplete knowledge of the network structure and the behavior of individual interfaces. The CMU MRSEC's goals are to understand the origins of the quantifiable characteristics of polycrystals that arise during processing, to develop strategies for influencing these characteristics in predictable ways, and to define microstructural metrics that can be directly related to macroscopic properties and performance. The Center's tools and findings will have applications in a range of practical materials processing applications and, to insure rapid implementation, we work collaboratively with government, industry, and international laboratories. The Center's major educational goals are to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in materials research, raise awareness of materials science and engineering among high school students through the curricula used in chemistry, physics, and earth science classes, provide meaningful research experiences for undergraduates, and support interdisciplinary graduate education."

This innovation will be timely and useful in that it coincides with recent improvements in study design and data collection methodologies that have led to increased availability of and interest in longitudinal data among social, behavioral, and economic researchers. The methodology will be motivated by a diverse range of applications that include studies of crop diversification of tobacco farmers, suicidal behavior of adolescents, and emotional changes monitored through ""Experience Sampling Methods,"" among others. The methodology will be called Temporal Configuration Analysis (TCA) so as to emphasize the focus on detection and identification of meaningful patterns in individual behavior trajectories over time. The key element in TCA will be a dynamic model that tracks the transition of ""latent states"" from one time point to another for each individual. Latent states (e.g., health state, psychological state, political inclination) can be viewed as summary measures of observed variables that translate to or condition manifested behavior. TCA will allow a researcher to identify homogeneous subgroups of individuals in terms of their temporal trajectories of latent states and then to examine the profile of each subgroup. Accordingly, a researcher will be able to interpret the results from analysis of multi-wave data in terms of both observed and latent measures and their trajectories. This will provide additional behavioral meaning and insight. TCA will also feature a broad range of component statistical models to provide users with flexibility in handling commonly encountered data characteristics, such as cross-sectional dependence, state-dependence, and serial correlation. TCA will create a statistical framework for analyzing multi-wave data in which inter-temporal qualitative information is of interest.<br/><br/>The project will have immediate, broad, and significant impact on the social, behavioral, and economic sciences and statistical research. First, researchers will be able to analyze multi-wave data in a new way that is different from and more informative than traditional methods such as latent growth curve analysis. For example, it will be possible to describe and visualize behavioral responses by projecting these configurations onto the space of actual behavior. Second, the project will contribute to the science of statistics, specifically in the area of hidden Markov models (HMM). The investigators expect that once this method is developed, explicated, and applied, statisticians and mathematical scientists will expand the TCA framework to include additional innovative research applications. The project's impact will be broadened and maximized in several ways: (1) dissemination of accessible, user-friendly, high-quality software that will document the TCA methodology and allow researchers to use it easily; (2) integration of research and education at several levels-grades 10-12, undergraduate, and graduate; and (3) interaction between the team of applied and theoretical investigators and various research groups, both nationally and internationally, with emphasis on publishing applied research findings. The project will deliver Web-based end-products-high-quality programs in packages familiar to social, behavioral, and economic researchers. The investigators will collaborate with the Center of Excellence in Research, Teaching, and Learning (CERTL) at Wake Forest University, using its infrastructure and experience in training American students in science and engineering, to integrate research into education. The project team, which includes national and international researchers from several disciplines, will leverage this collaboration to increase both the impact and visibility of the project through extensive coordination with various national and international research groups.

Study of these genes is justified by the evidence, obtained with previous NSF support, that the MDR genes play an important role in the control of plant growth and development by controlling the flow and distribution of the plant growth hormone auxin, as well as by the possibility that the findings will shed light on basic cellular processes related to human health. (Over-expression of the animal MDR1 gene in cancer cells is linked to the development of drug-resistant tumors.) The activities proposed for the next funding cycle are focused on learning how the MDR genes (particularly MDR1 and MDR4) control the subcellular localization of the PIN auxin efflux regulators, which in turn control distribution of auxin. The work will result in a more detailed understanding of how auxin-dependent events at the cellular and molecular levels influence the form and shape of plants. The experiments will include 1) quantification of mdr mutant phenotypes using electronic imaging and custom computational software, 2) studies of protein localization and kinetics of trafficking using fluorescently-tagged MDR and PIN proteins, 3) structure-function studies of the cytoplasmic tail of MDR1 and MDR4 to learn about the targeting mechanism.<br/><br/>In addition to the scientific goals of determining the functions of MDR proteins and how auxin controls plant growth and development, the project will include activities to promote a greater understanding of plants in the public at large and to stimulate youth to think about the science of plant biology. The personnel funded in this project have developed a traveling Discover Plants! outreach exhibit that can be set up at school science fairs. Through a mixture of media (live plants, microscopes, computer videos, and take-home projects), kindergarden through 8th grade students are exposed to various aspects of basic plant biology and its relevance to our everyday lives. Discover Plants! will be further developed and broadened to include more graduate student operators. Outreach at a higher scientific level will also occur via a website that will explain and demonstrate how measurements of shapes, plant shapes in particular, are made from a series of images. Downloadable software and some sample images will be provided. Links to and from engineering, mathematics, and computational sites will increase the exchange of information and ideas between these disciplines.

QMC is one among the most precise known techniques to study realistic materials in physics and chemistry and provide a significant gain in precision compared traditional density functional theory (DFT) approaches. This will bring electronic structure quantum Monte Carlo methodology to a qualitatively higher level of applicability to complex materials and lead to increased accuracy. The new QMC techniques will be applied to forefront problems in the properties of Earth materials in order to obtain accurate equations of state, phase transitions, and elasticity of solid materials that are of high interest in geophysics. One significant limitation of today's QMC methods is the high computational demand, which currently makes applications to larger systems including solid solutions prohibitively expensive. A substantial portion of the QMC computation is spent on forming and evaluating a Slater determinant, which is constructed from one-particle orbitals. The team plans to develop and apply different localization transformations in order to obtain a sparse determinant. Two linear algebra methods will be developed for their efficient evaluation. First, Krylov's method for the iterative evaluation of a determinant will be incorporated into QMC. Secondly, the trace of the determinant will be calculated with Monte Carlo methods.

Several of the most important agricultural crops are polyploid, such as wheat and Brassica, and many have identifiable polyploidy in their ancestry, such as maize. Whole genome duplication creates an autopolyploid by multiplying a single genome or an allopolyploid by combining two or more divergent genomes. Auto- and allopolyploids exhibit functional divergence of duplicate genes, increased variation and result in novel genetic interactions leading to greater phenotypic variability and hybrid vigor (heterosis). In this project, several hypotheses will be tested concerning the mechanisms of dosage-dependent and non-additive gene regulation in three complementary plant systems: Arabidopsis, Brassica and corn. The genetic basis of inbreeding depression, allopolyploid sterility, and hybrid vigor will be determined. Models for the molecular basis of gene regulation in polyploids using transgenic reporters and endogenous genes will be determined. The roles of chromatin structure and RNA interference in non-additive gene regulation will be tested. Gene expression changes in new polyploidy populations will be compared to identify loci affecting de novo phenotypic variation and hybrid vigor in polyploids.<br/><br/>In the post-sequencing era, polyploidy is one of the most challenging fields in plant biology. Results from this research will not only illuminate our understanding of polyploidy and the genetic mechanisms of non-additive gene action, but may also enable the improvement of agricultural crops. <br/><br/>Microarray data analysis and management will be streamlined using genome informatics and statistical methodologies. Research and training activities will be updated monthly at the project website.

This region can be conveniently thought of as consisting of overlapping turbulent bottom boundary layers (TBBL) and turbulent bottom mixed layers (TBML). Because of the ubiquitous nature of flows along isobaths and their relative simplicity, much of the recent research on turbulent regions along boundaries has been performed under these conditions; e.g., flows along coastlines and ridges. Field experiments, coupled with theoretical and numerical modeling efforts during the past several decades have sharpened our understanding of this boundary region. There are gaps in our knowledge, however. There is a need, for example, to (i) have an improved understanding of the relation between the TBBL and the TBML, (ii) to have more information on Ekman layer arrest for turbulent flows because it is observed in certain field programs and not in others, (ii) there is controversy on the occurrence of double log boundary layers and (iv) it is desirable to<br/>better organize and consolidate the knowledge gained from various field measurements on oceanic turbulent boundary layers into some sort of unified whole. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project lies in the possibility of demonstrating clearly that laboratory simulations employing turbulence can or cannot quantitatively simulate oceanic boundary layers. The physical system considered is the along isobath flow of a stratified fluid in the presence of background rotation. The first objective of the proposed research is to show that the ocean's TBBL can be simulated in the laboratory using a sufficiently large rotating platform. To accomplish this, the laboratory simulations are to be compared directly with existing field data from studies of the deep water flow of the North Atlantic Deep Western Boundary Current along the Blake Outer Ridge and the winter and summer-time along isobath currents along the Northern California Shelf. These direct comparisons with ocean data will also shed light on the relation between the TBBL and the TBML. The second objective is to generalize data on the bottom shear stress, boundary layer depth and angle between the geostrophic flow and the bottom shear stress in terms of the external parameters of the system; these include the slope Burger number, the normalized time from the beginning of the experiment and parameters defining the surface roughness. Similarity will require the proof that, as in many engineering flows that as the Reynolds number becomes large, the flow characteristics become independent of the Reynolds number, a condition termed Reynolds number similarity.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: This project will have broad impact on the range of oceanographic sub-disciplines if it can be successful in defining gross features of the bottom boundary layer in terms of a clear set of parameters, many of which can be measured remotely. Additionally the project will support international science and provide US and French students opportunities to interact in an international atmosphere."

One of the most critical limitations is power. Sensors require power to sense, send and receive information, and in virtually all wireless networks currently deployed are battery-powered. Batteries account for most of the mass of the sensor and have a finite life, resulting either in periodic replacement or a limit to the useful life of the whole network. Many environmental applications require data at high frequencies, confounding problems with batteries as battery life decreases as the frequency of data acquisition and transfer increases. Battery-powered sensors are a serious impediment to the development of sensor networks that can function unattended and autonomously in complex, sensitive or hostile environments. To circumvent this problem, the PIs propose a new approach to power supplies in wireless sensor networks: battery-free, passively powered sensors. Sensors in this system will receive power in the form of spread-spectrum radio waves from a powered base station, which in turn is powered by batteries that are continuously recharged by a solar panel. Thus, a single power source will power 80-100 sensors, which could remain functional indefinitely with minimal attention following deployment. Successful development of this novel system requires a total-systems approach in which data storage, routing, transport, and calibration protocols are designed to minimize the number of bits transmitted while ensuring accurate measurement. This project will develop a prototype wireless network of sensors that will support measurements at high temporal and spatial frequency in complex, sensitive environments. Broad impacts will arise from multi-disciplinary collaboration among computer scientists, engineers, and ecologists; participation by students spanning undergraduate to post doctoral levels; integration with ongoing IGERT, SMILE, and LTER Schoolyard education programs; and communication through project website."

It quantifies their respective roles in the dynamics of countries' external deficits. The investigators constructed a disaggregated database of U.S. foreign assets and liabilities to obtain novel insights into the predictability of asset returns and exchange rates and the importance of valuation effects for the sustainability of external deficits. They will extend this work along three dimensions. First, they will do a similar analysis with other countries, contrasting large financially developed economies (UK, Japan) with small open economies (Canada) as well as emerging markets. Second, they will develop new theories of portfolio investment where international wealth transfers and predictable excess returns play a key role. Lastly, the investigators use their methodology to analyze fiscal adjustment. <br/><br/>The Intellectual Merit of this proposal is to further our understanding of how financial globalization affects the process of external adjustment. Traditional models focus on deficit countries restoring external balance through future changes in net exports. For the US, the investigators find that revaluations of foreign assets and liabilities are a quantitatively important -and stabilizing- channel as well. This research helps also identify important determinants of asset returns and currency movements. For the US exchange rate, the investigators' model outperforms the random walk out-of-sample from one quarter to four years. The proposal extends the empirical analysis in order to assess the importance and direction of valuation effects for other countries. The proposal also develops a class of general equilibrium dynamic models consistent with observed patterns of capital flows, asset prices, currency fluctuations and net exports. Those models feature home bias in equity and international wealth transfers, elements rarely incorporated in open economy models and yet crucial for realism. The proposed models allow the investigators to study the effect of demand and supply shocks or changes in portfolio preferences such as erosion of home bias or loss of international currency status on the capacity of countries to accumulate foreign debt. Finally the proposed activity extends our understanding of government debt dynamics by measuring the importance of valuation effects for fiscal adjustments.<br/><br/>The proposed activity has many Broader Impacts. First, the project provides a new perspective on the issue of current account sustainability by highlighting the role of capital gains and losses on gross foreign assets and liabilities. It provides a theoretically grounded measure of external imbalance and constructs a database to implement it. Initial results show that US external imbalances are currently smaller than in the mid 1980s. This fact alone is important for the policy debate. Second, the investigators' framework suggests that the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on external accounts operates inter alia through valuation effects via exchange rate changes. These effects play very differently in developed economies and in emerging markets where most liabilities are in dollars. They have implications for the choice of exchange rate regime. Third, predictability of the returns on net foreign asset positions and of the exchange rate has important consequences for financial markets, the design of effective economic policies, and hedging strategies for international businesses. Fourth, the proposed methodology can also be applied fruitfully to the analysis of other imbalances. The investigators propose to look at fiscal imbalances where valuation effects (via inflation) may be important. Finally the quarterly database of US foreign assets and liabilities at market value that the research team constructed has already raised the interest of other researchers and organizations (IMF, BIS). The NBER has asked them to participate in a special conference on G7 current account imbalances. They are planning to build similar databases for other industrialized as well as emerging countries. These data could be used for the testing of a wide array of open economy macroeconomic theories."

Much of this data originates from on-line sensors that act as streaming data sources, providing a continuous flow of information. As sensor sources proliferate, the flow of data becomes a deluge, and the extraction and delivery of important features in a timely and comprehensible manner becomes an ever increasingly difficult problem. More specifically, developing data mining and assimilation tools for data deluged applications faces three fundamental challenges. The amount of distributed real time streaming data is so large that even current extreme scale computing cannot effectively process it. Second, today's broadly deployable network protocols and web services do not provide the low latency and high bandwidth required by high volume real time data streams and distributed computing resources connected<br/>over networks with high bandwidth delay products. Finally, the vast majority of today's statistical and data mining algorithms assume that all the data is co-located and at rest in files. Here, the real time data streams are distributed and the applications that consume them must be optimized to process multiple high volume real time streams. The goal is to develop novel algorithms and hardware acceleration schemes to allow real-time statistical modeling and change detection on such large-scale streaming data sets. By using Service Oriented Architecture principles, a framework for integrating high -performance change detection software services, including accelerations of commonly used kernels in statistical modeling, into a Grid messaging substrate will be developed and tested. Geographical Information System (GIS) services will be supported using<br/>Open Geospatial Consortium standards to enable geo-referencing. <br/><br/>This project has the potential to have near-term and long-term impact in several important areas. In the near-term, the implementation of kernels and modules of statistical modeling and change detection algorithms will allow the end-user applications (e.g., homeland security, defense) to achieve one to two orders of magnitude improvement in performance for data driven decision support. In the longer term, the availability of toolkits and kernels for the change detection and data mining algorithms will facilitate the development of applications in many areas including defense, security, science and others. Furthermore, this research will bring the use of reconfigurable<br/>architectural acceleration of functions on streaming data including change detection and data mining, thereby opening new avenues of research and enabling newer data-driven applications on complex datasets. Both graduate and undergraduate students (through undergraduate fellowships) are engaged in the research. In addition, team members actively engage with minority serving institutions using audio/video and distance education tools."

With this RDE-FRI project, TERC and Vcom3D will use the SigningAvatar<br/>accessibility software to develop an interactive 3D dictionary of science terms and definitions to support<br/>access to standards-based science content among elementary and middle-grade students who are deaf or<br/>hard of hearing and whose first language is sign; evaluate the extent to which use of the dictionary<br/>furthers understanding of science content, interest in science, and the ability to study independently; and<br/>create a more robust sign/facial expression/body space library for use in developing subsequent volumes<br/>of the dictionary or in SigningAvatar-enabling other science materials. At the end of two years,<br/>products will include:<br/> robust 3D interactive SigningAvatar-enabled dictionary of at least 1,300 key science terms<br/>identified from instructional materials used in elementary and middle grade classrooms;<br/> report of findings from analysis of qualitative and quantitative student and teacher field-test data<br/>about the effectiveness of the dictionary;<br/> addition of new vocabulary of technical signs to the Avatar characters' sign/facial expression/body<br/>space lexicon in the areas of life, physical, earth and space science, and scientific inquiry.<br/>Intellectual Merits. The project represents a third collaboration between TERC and Vcom3D and<br/>leverages findings from two existing collaborations. Founded in 1965, TERC is a not-for-profit education<br/>research and development organization dedicated to the improvement of science, mathematics, and<br/>technology teaching and learning for all students. Vcom3D is a female owned and managed small<br/>business, founded in 1997, and the developers of the SigningAvatar accessibility software. In 2001,<br/>working together, the partners combined forces for the first time to SigningAvatar-enable the web<br/>activities for three of the elementary and middle-grade science curriculum units called EnViSci Network.<br/>(Development of the SigningAvatar software, EnViSci Network, and this first collaboration were<br/>funded, in part, by NSF.) Findings show all students who completed the signed units had significantly<br/>higher post-test scores compared to those on matched pre-tests; post-test scores were also similar to those<br/>for hearing students. Realizing the benefits of the Avatar and that cost and time preclude one-by-one<br/>signing of even the most widely used instructional materials, the partners explored alternative means for<br/>integrating the SigningAvatar software into science materials on a broader scale. What emerged was the<br/>need for an interactive 3D dictionary of signed science terms and definitions that could be used as a<br/>universal tool for teaching and learning independent of the curriculum in place or materials being used.<br/>With funding from NEC Foundation of America, the partners embarked on a second collaboration and<br/>developed a 300-term prototype of such a dictionary. The Signing Science Dictionary project, and third<br/>collaboration between the partners, builds on their collected knowledge.<br/>Broader Impacts. The proposed dictionary is designed to serve the approximately 50,000 students in the<br/>target population who require services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and<br/>are required by it and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 to have access to the same content as<br/>students with disabilities. The dictionary will offer members of this target population greater access to the<br/>same opportunities as hearing students for rigorous science study that can potentially lead to careers in<br/>STEM and expand over a lifetime. It will also offer teachers a library of recognized signs for studying<br/>scientific ideas with students. Unlike existing dictionaries, this first-of-its kind product will allow users to<br/>select from a range of characters with different personalities and facial expressions, to alter the speed of<br/>signing, and to sign a selected term and its definition in American Sign Language (ASL) or Signed<br/>English (SE). Delivered as a single CD-ROM for use with a Windows operating system, this complete<br/>assistive tool will require low bandwidth and can be used with and without an Internet connection.<br/>Publication by a major publisher will result in dissemination of the dictionary nationally. Terms in the<br/>lexicon will be available through Vcom3D to publishers, developers, and educators to sign other<br/>dictionaries or science materials."

Wright, Stevens Institute and Sheng Zhong, State University of New York at Buffalo<br/><br/>The rapid expansion of the Internet has changed the way we communicate, with ever-increasing aspects of our daily life involving computation and data communication. However, many communications protocol designs assume that all participants will follow the specified protocols, and do not maintain their desirable properties if they don't. One approach to this problem is to design for a world in which some parties may maliciously deviate from their protocols in arbitrary ways. However, the resulting designs are typically expensive or impossible to achieve, and in many cases overestimate the kinds of misbehavior one is likely to encounter. Weaker security goals are more achievable, but often underestimate the willingness of participants to cheat.<br/><br/>This project studies an intermediate notion of security, known as incentive compatibility. In many practical settings, it is reasonable to assume that users will tend to act in their own best interests. Therefore, if one can design and use protocols that are incentive-compatible, in that following the protocol produces outcomes for participants at least as good as deviating from the protocol, then one can in many settings avoid misbehavior. Incentive compatibility, which borrows ideas from economics and game theory, is a more finely tunable notion of security than traditional security models, allowing different kinds of participants motivated by different incentives. Such solutions can provide better trust and assurance than protocols secure only against passive adversaries, at a potentially lower cost than protocols secure against an arbitrarily malicious adversary. This allows incentive-compatible protocols to provide the ""right"" level of security, at the ""right"" cost.<br/><br/>Four areas studied are: incentive-compatible ad hoc networks, incentive-compatible data mining, (both of which can significantly benefit from introducing incentive-compatible solutions), testing tools for incentive compatibility, and foundations of incentive compatibility."

This requires dynamic integration of time-varying measurements of flow, pressure and contaminant concentration with analytical modules including models to simulate the state of the system, statistical methods for adaptive sampling, and optimization methods to search for efficient control strategies. For realistic distribution systems, the analytical modules are highly compute-intensive, requiring multi-level parallel processing via computer clusters. While data often drive the analytical modules, data needs for improving the accuracy and certainty of the solutions generated by these modules dynamically change when a contamination event unfolds. Since such time-sensitive threat events require real-time responses, the computational needs must also be adaptively matched with available resources. Thus, a software system is needed to facilitate this integration via a high-performance computing architecture (e.g., the TeraGrid) such that the measurement system, the analytical modules and the computing resources can mutually adapt and steer each other. The goal of this multi-disciplinary research is to develop a cyberinfrastructure system that will both adapt to and control changing needs in data, models, computer resources and management choices facilitated by a dynamic workflow design. Using virtual simulation and a field study, this cyberinfrastructure will be tested on illustrative scenarios for adaptive management of contamination events in water distribution systems.<br/><br/>Urban water distribution systems are vulnerable to accidental and intentional contamination incidents that could result in adverse human health and safety impacts. The pipe network in a typical municipal distribution system includes redundant flow paths to ensure service when parts of the network are unavailable, and is designed with significant storage to deliver water during daily peak demand periods. Thus, a typical network is highly interconnected and experiences significant and frequent fluctuations in flows and transport paths. These design features unintentionally enable contamination at a single point in the system to spread rapidly via different pathways through the network, unbeknown to consumers and operators. When a contamination event is detected via the first line of defense, e.g., data from a water quality surveillance sensor network and reports from consumers, the municipal authorities are faced with several critical questions as the contamination event unfolds: Where is the source of contamination? When and for how long did this contamination occur? Where additional hydraulic or water quality measurements should be taken to pinpoint the source more accurately? What is the current and near future extent of contamination? What response action, such as shutting down portions of the network, implementing hydraulic control strategies, or introducing decontaminants, should be taken to minimize the impact of the contamination event? What would be the impact on consumers by these actions? Real-time answers to such complex questions will present significant computational challenges. This project will address these challenges by developing an adaptive cyberinfrastucture that will enable real-time processing and control through dynamic integration of computational components and real-time sensor data. This system will be evaluated using contamination scenarios based on field-scale data from a large metropolitan area."

However, a number of unresolved questions regarding the biogeochemical redox cycling of As and microbial pathways for arsenate, As(V), reduction remain to be answered. The proposed project will address the following unresolved questions:<br/>Question 1: In a given sediment environment, is in situ As(V) reduction related to detoxification or energy acquisition pathways? What factors induce these pathways?<br/>Question 2: Under environmental conditions and at environmentally-relevant As concentrations, what are in situ rates of As(V) reduction and what factors limit these rates?<br/>Question 3: How do the varying microbial capacities (i.e., iron (Fe)(III), and/or As(V) reducing activity) influence the mobilization of As from solid phases?<br/> The proposed project will combine molecular biological and geochemical approaches to interrogate microbial redox cycling of As and its coupling with Fe cycling at field sites with natural, geothermal As inputs. Factors influencing in situ rates of As(V) reduction will be examined and the conditions that trigger this process will be identified. Molecular tools will be employed to track abundance and expression of genes involved in As(V) reduction in situ.<br/> Specifically, Question 1 will be addressed by determining the environmental conditions that affect the gene expression for the two main pathways for As(V) reduction: respiratory (arrA) and detoxification (arsC). The bacterium, Shewanella sp. str. ANA-3, which is amenable to genetic manipulation will serve as our model organism for these studies. Field studies will focus on the development and application of molecular biological techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to track and monitor the expression of arrA and arsC in environmental samples. Question 2 will be addressed by introducing hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) pre-equilibrated with As(V) into the ambient sediment environment using a novel gel probe in which the HFO suspension is immobilized in a highly porous gel. Withdrawal of the gels over time and analysis of the oxidation state of As associated with the HFO suspension will allow us to determine the timescale for As(V) reduction in situ. Sediment incubation experiments will also be performed to determine how As(V) reduction rates respond to changes in, for example, organic carbon substrates. We will address Question 3 by examining As mobilization from natural sediments and model solids by mutants of ANA-3 that are deficient in one or more of the genes for Fe(III) reduction and/or As(V) reduction by respiratory and/or detoxification pathways. <br/> The results of the proposed project will substantially increase our understanding of the fundamental biological and geochemical processes that influence the occurrence and mobility of As in the subsurface environment. The project will contribute to development of the science base for prediction and mitigation of human exposure to As, which is a major health issue world-wide. The proposed project will also support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, who will be exposed to a wide range of experimental methods and who will develop the skills needed to pursue interdisciplinary environmental research."

A problem of fundamental importance here is to achieve better representation of the data with relatively severe dimension reduction, rather than simple dimension reduction through a lower rank approximation of a matrix. One difficulty is that it is not easy to measure by a theoretical formula how well a certain dimension reduction method provides a good representation of the original data, and it will be essential to conduct theoretical research in parallel with experimental study."

Over the last five years several research groups have provided detailed characterizations of the static geochemical characteristics of groundwater and sediments in arsenic-contaminated aquifers. The challenge now is to determine how groundwater<br/>flow transports chemicals in and out of the subsurface, and hence controls subsurface biogeochemistry. We propose to develop novel hydrologic methods to characterize the complex spatial<br/>and temporal patterns of groundwater flow, and then to employ hydrogeologic models to study the evolution of groundwater geochemistry. By combining dynamic hydrological models with geochemical<br/>characterization we intend to answer key scientific questions that have thus far eluded us: Why has arsenic not been flushed from some aquifers? Combined estimates of groundwater residence times and arsenic retardation factors indicate that arsenic residence times are only decades to centuries, implying that arsenic should be flushed from the aquifers that are thousands of years old. Is<br/>dissolved arsenic supplied by a continuous source, or are high concentrations transient? Will arsenic concentrations change in the future? Our field injection-withdrawal experiments show that arsenic concentrations respond within days to biochemical perturbations. The adoption of dry-season<br/>rice cultivation has dramatically altered geochemical input and outputs from aquifers. How does this change affect subsurface geochemistry and dissolved arsenic concentrations? Why do arsenic concentrations differ between neighboring wells? Arsenic concentrations at nearby locations in grey-colored anoxic aquifers often differ greatly, despite similar sediment characteristics. Do<br/>these dramatic gradients result from the pattern of groundwater flow and recharge?<br/>What are the intellectual merits of the proposed activity?<br/>These questions can only be resolved by determining how groundwater dynamics control<br/>chemical input and output to aquifers over two timescales: (1) Seasonal cycle: The hydrology of Bangladesh annually cycles between Monsoon flooding and dry-season arid conditions when evapotranspiration greatly outstrips precipitation and irrigation water is pumped from aquifers to meet the transpiration demands of crops. This cycle drives water table oscillations that create seasonally varying oxic/anoxic<br/>conditions in soils and also drives water exchange between aquifers and surface water (rice paddies, ponds and rivers). (2) Anthropogenic changes over decades: The Ganges Delta has been dramatically altered over the last three decades by population growth and the advent of irrigated agriculture. Groundwater irrigation has changed the location, timing and chemical content of recharge.<br/>Anoxic irrigation water is ponded in rice fields over much of the land, thereby changing both the hydrologic budget and the biogeochemistry of recharge, potentially mobilizing arsenic from soil layers that<br/>may be rich in arsenic and iron (oxy)hydroxides. Furthermore, pumping changes flow-paths deep in aquifers, affecting both the rates and locations of recharge as well as groundwater exchange with surface<br/>water bodies that now receive much higher loads of untreated waste.<br/>We propose to: (1) Build on our successful field program in Bangladesh by extending our field characterization from vertical geochemical profiles at one location to three dimensional flow around this location; (2) Characterize recharge and discharge and map transient flow-paths through the aquifer by applying novel combination of natural isotope data and numerical inverse methods for groundwater flow;<br/>(3) Conduct a detailed study of geochemical fluxes through the bottom of a rice field, now a principle source of groundwater recharge at our site, and a very likely source of dissolved arsenic; (4) Construct predictive numerical models that couple groundwater flow and recharge with the biogeochemical transformations that control arsenic. What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?<br/>This collaborative project is built on our successful and productive partnership over the last five years. We will continue to place a significant emphasis on the education and transfer of technology, with<br/>further exchange of students between BUET, MIT and Tufts. We also will continue to collaborate with other research groups including Stanford, EAWAG in Switzerland, UBC in Vancouver and UCLA. Our research findings should answer some key scientific questions and also help evaluate alternative arsenic<br/>mitigation strategies and better manage water resources in Bangladesh."

Glucosinolates, the compounds that give vegetables in the mustard/cabbage/broccoli family their characteristic pungent flavor, are metabolites derived from amino acids. Glucosinolates defend plants against insect and herbivore feeding and also have anti-pathogen properties. In addition, glucosinolates are anti-cancer compounds in the human diet. The laboratory mustard Arabidopsis provides a powerful experimental system in which to understand the regulation of glucosinolate synthesis. The Arabidopsis ATR1 protein is a key positive regulator of genes needed to synthesize indolic glucosinolates (IG's) derived from the amino acid tryptophan. High expression of ATR1 increases IG levels, and inactivation of ATR1 causes a partial IG deficiency. The goal of this project is to understand more about the regulation of IG synthesis in Arabidopsis with a particular focus on the role of ATR1. Proteins that are highly related to ATR1 will be tested for whether they also act in IG regulation, or in regulation of other glucosinolate synthesis pathways. The structural features that distinguish proteins like ATR1 that specifically control IG synthesis will be dissected. In parallel, the DNA sequences that are targeted by ATR1 to mediate its activating effects will be identified using biochemical and genetic approaches. The complete annotation of the Arabidopsis genome together with facile assays for IG upregulation offer an unprecedented opportunity to fully understand the regulatory network for this important plant metabolic pathway. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will elucidate how glucosinolate genes are regulated, and provide unique tools for modulating glucosinolates in agricultural plants as a means to improve their insect and pathogen resistance. The project will also provide training in plant genetics and molecular biology for graduate and undergraduate students."

Because cnidarians diverged from the rest of the animals prior to the evolution of organs, their overall anatomy is quite simple. Despite this however, cnidarians have attained incredible diversity, comprising over 11,000 species, many of which display elaborate structures and complex life histories. The lack of organs and other anatomical landmarks has made it difficult for scientists to discern their evolutionary relationships. Recent technological and theoretical advances in the sequencing and analysis of DNA provide the opportunity to use the information encoded within an organism's genetic code to elucidate evolutionary relationships. The primary aim of this proposal is to obtain DNA sequence data from 1,800 cnidarian species: this will generate approximately 23 million base pairs of cnidarian DNA sequence, and the specimens from which the sequences are obtained will be retained in natural history museum collections. The information encoded in the DNA will be used to reconstruct cnidarian phylogenies (evolutionary trees), using computer algorithms and supercomputing facilities. Some of the questions this proposal will address are: Was the ancestor to all of cnidarians solitary or colonial? Are jellyfish or hydras more closely related to the corals? How and when did coral skeletons evolve? What are the evolutionary transitions between a simple hydra polyp and a complex Portuguese Man-of-War colony? Reconstructing a cnidarian evolutionary tree is important for our understanding of the patterns and processes that accompanied the early diversification of animal life. <br/><br/><br/><br/> Formal and informal education will result from this research. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars, including those belonging to groups under-represented in the sciences, will be trained. A symposium on cnidarian evolutionary relationships will be organized by the investigators at a national scientific meeting. A Cnidaria Tree of Life database will be developed to include outreach and learning components such as images, common names, and keys designed to appeal to students at all levels as well as interested users such as divers and aquarists. Museum exhibits will be created based on research results, one at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum, and one, entitled ""Cnidarian Diversity in the Oceans"" that will be part of the new Oceans Hall, due to open at the National Museum of Natural History in 2008. A website and classroom poster (in both English and Spanish) integrated with the latter exhibit will be created in collaboration with a K-12 educator supported through NSF's Research Experience for Teachers program."

Additional methodological approaches are necessary to characterize the role of such visual cortical activity during non-visual perception and the underlying neural mechanisms. With National Science Foundation funding, this research embodies a collaboration among Drs. Krishnankutty Sathian, John Foxe, and Charles Schroeder that brings different techniques to bear on the issue of multisensory form processing in extrastriate visual cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans is being combined with event-related potential (ERP) studies in humans and neurophysiologic studies in macaque monkeys, using experimental designs common to the three methods. The high spatial resolution of fMRI and the high temporal resolution of ERP studies are mutually complementary and allow specification of the temporal profile of neural activity, as well as precise localization. Monkey studies entail a combination of field potential and action potential analyses that allow both direct comparison to human (ERP/fMRI) data and investigation of the cellular bases of ERP and fMRI effects. Specific Aim I investigates the recruitment of visual cortical activity by tactile form discriminations and Specific Aim II explores multisensory interactions between vision and touch, during tactile form perception.  The combination of three complementary experimental approaches being brought to bear on a common set of questions, using a common set of tasks, is unique and promises to provide a much more complete picture of the relevant neural processes than any of the approaches in isolation. This tripartite approach allows the acquisition of convergent evidence on the specific brain mechanisms of multisensory interactions, which are increasingly recognized to be ubiquitous and essential for sensory processing as well as other aspects of cognition. <br/><br/>Among its broader impacts, this project exemplifies the value of bringing multiple experimental approaches to bear on a set of issues. The project is anticipated to lead eventually to improvement in assistive technology available to individuals with sensory deprivation of any kind. By establishing a long-term collaboration between the three principal investigators, students and post-doctoral trainees will be able to acquire expertise in more than one of the experimental approaches, interact with more than one mentor, and further, train explicitly in the emerging field of multisensory science, a field with few formal training opportunities. <br/>"

B. PEROT<br/>INSTITUTION: UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS- AMHERST<br/><br/>One of the greatest bottlenecks in Engineering Design today is the computational prediction of turbulent fluids. In a vast variety of applications: from air pollution, to engine efficiency and emissions, to global climate prediction, to submarine performance, to galactic evolution, turbulence plays a critical physical role. Some of these problems will never be computationally tractable without a turbulence model. Efficient turbulence models that are predictive could have a profound effect on how computational fluid dynamics (CDF) is used in the design process. While existing engineering turbulence models do not currently provide predictive accuracy, work performed under this grant by modeling the turbulence structure as well as the fluctuating velocity magnitudes the Eddy Interaction (EI) Model is able predict the influence of the mean flow on the turbulence exactly. The computational cost of this approach is a few times that of the mean flow calculation and many orders of magnitude less expensive than large eddy simulation (LES) or direct numerical simulation (DNS) solutions. This is a region of the cost/performance parameter space that has not been extensively explored previously in the context of turbulence modeling and which holds great promise. The objective of the work is to explore generalizations of the EI model to inhomogeneous flows by exploiting its direct connection with the exact (but unclosed) two-point velocity correlation transport equation and probability density function (PDF) transport equations. The model's predictive capabilities will be demonstrated on a wide variety of well-known benchmark turbulent flows, some of which cannot be accurately predicted using existing modeling approaches. The broader impact of this work, beyond its interdisciplinary nature, will be to generate renewed interest in this difficult but extremely important problem. From a mathematical standpoint it will elucidate how complex multi-scale constrained systems can be approximated (coarse grained) efficiently. From a technological standpoint, it is noted that nematic liquid crystals (used in modern televisions and computers) obey almost identical equations to the EI model and could benefit directly from these methods. This project will provide graduate and undergraduate students within applied mathematics and engineering the opportunity to collaborate with each other while participating in cutting edge research that spans between disciplines."

There is mounting evidence that liverworts (Phylum Marchantiophyta) were the first green plants to diversify on land some 500,000 million years ago and as such they are the oldest living lineage of terrestrial organisms. This species-rich group of small green plants is remarkably diverse in structure, and includes extremely ancient relictual lineages as well as more recent radiations of closely related species. The antiquity of liverworts and the rich biodiversity at all taxonomic levels provide an unparalleled window into early land plant diversification. This collaborative effort brings together experts from around the world for a multidisciplinary, highly integrated approach that combines anatomical and developmental features with DNA sequence and genome structural characters to resolve phylogenetic relationships across the entire spectrum of liverwort diversity. Three general types of data will be compiled: 1) conservative morphological and genome characters to resolve deep ""backbone"" relationships, 2) anatomical/developmental data to resolve intermediate-depth lineages, and 3) morphological and DNA sequence characters to resolve relationships among a sample of 800 taxa representing all genera of liverworts. A second major goal of the project is to integrate phylogenetic inferences and bionformatic efforts between this and other on-going NSF-supported projects, including several funded ATOL programs. These integrative activities include contributions to studies of genome structure and evolution across land plants, expansions of novel informatic tools to make methods, results, and implications widely accessible, and continued development of DNA sequence utilities that will benefit a broad range of scientists working on diverse organisms.<br/> This project relies on the cooperation with and integration among research programs focused on resolving the green plant Tree Of Life. Integrative activities are substantive and consequential, and include expansions to phylogenetic databases and methodological/conceptual aspects of work toward resolving the Tree Of Life. At least six post-doctoral associates and as many graduate students will be supported by the project, with substantial involvement of undergraduates as well. An effort to involve and retain individuals from underrepresented groups will be orchestrated through established federal programs that focus on such initiatives, including the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and the McNair Scholars Program. A solid mentoring infrastructure will be developed within each research team to provide support and professional experiences that ensure productivity and success of all participants. Outreach efforts include web presentations on the morphology and identification of liverworts for educators at all levels, development of web-based materials and a workshop targeting secondary school teachers, and increasing public awareness through weekend field excursions."

Iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and its redox cycling exerts a strong influence on the behavior of various organic and inorganic compounds in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The structure and function of microbial communities associated with Fe redox cycling in near-surface environments is therefore an important topic in environmental microbiology and biogeochemistry. This project addresses several unique aspects of microbial community structure and physiology related to Fe redox cycling and biomineralization in modern subsoils and shallow groundwater environments. Such environments are primary receptors of both natural and anthropogenic materials (e.g. run-off from urban and agricultural systems), and microorganisms play a key role in subsurface biogeochemical processes.<br/>The proposed research will explore novel strategies that microbial populations and communities may utilize to derive energy from Fe redox cycling, and will examine the mineralogical signatures of such activities. Experimental reactive transport systems will be used to mimic natural subsurface environments in which temporal variations in the input of electron donors and acceptors are expected to strongly influence microbial community development and patterns of Fe biomineralization. The experimental systems will support microbial communities from either a freshwater wetland surface sediment or shallow Atlantic Coastal plain aquifer sediment. We hypothesize that the energy available from Fe and nitrogen redox interactions will lead to the development of microbial populations and/or communities specifically adapted to take advantage of the energy available during redox oscillations. In addition, we anticipate that the Fe mineralogy of sediments subject to redox fluctuations will evolve toward a suite of metastable minerals of relative low crystallinity and high reactivity relative to those in sediments under stable redox conditions. The reactor systems to be developed in this study represent novel research techniques for examining linkages between microbial physiology, community structure, biogeochemical reaction dynamics, and Fe biomineralization. The geomicrobiological and biogeochemical information gained from these model systems will be incorporated into a microbial energetics-based numerical simulation framework that will allow the results of our experimental studies to be transferred to a variety of surface and subsurface sedimentary environments.<br/>The project will train two Ph.D. students in multidisciplinary biogeochemical research methodologies as well as techniques for numerical simulation of biogeochemical processes and microbial population dynamics in sediments. An undergraduate intern will participate in microbial culturing and isolation at IU. The UW Ph.D. student will participate in the training of a summer Research Experience for Teachers (RET) fellow. The RET fellow will conduct original research, and travel to scientific meetings to present his or her research during the last two years of the project. The UW Ph.D. student will also participate in the NSF-sponsored Center for Integration of Research, Training, and Learning (CIRTL) program at UW, which offers courses and coordinates internship programs that provide practical experience in bringing science to the broader community. In addition to these activities, IU will undertake a novel collaboration with the Fulbright Academy of Science and Technology (FAST) aimed at increasing public understanding about the importance of environmental microbiology. We will work with FAST to develop presentation modules that will be offered by FAST members at selected locations around the U.S. The general presentations will cover topics of current interest to the public such as the role of bacteria in the metabolism of greenhouse gases, degradation of pollutants, and nutrient cycling (specifically N and Fe) in soils and sediments."

The research approach is based on increasing the local softening rate of the deforming volume ahead of the rotating tool by using a multi-pin tool capable of intensifying local rate of shear in the process zone many-fold. This novel concept has not been examined previously. Through analysis of shear rate, it is expected that a combination of reduced rotational speed of multiple pin tool and modification of the tool path would lead to reduced deformation forces on the tool surface while performing efficient mass transfer at the joining interface. A multi-pin welding head would be designed and built and its operation studied by varying process parameters. It is anticipated that NSF funds would be used for design of tooling and theoretical analysis of the process, while operational physics and optimization studies would be conducted with additional industrial support.<br/><br/>Graduate student involved in the project would be trained to think along challenging and innovative directions in addition to routine experiments and analysis. This would place the student in a position of ownership of technology, and commanding position in industry later. Improved process could lead to longer tool life and simpler operation, which could become a preferred approach for industry. Increased and widespread use of this technology would create more manufacturing jobs tied to this technology. Industry mangers believe that future growth potential of this technology is major. The knowledge of this technology will be incorporated into engineering courses at the University of Michigan."

The principal scientific goal is<br/>to better understand the recently discovered phenomenon of episodic slip transients<br/>and its role in either relieving or increasing strain accumulating along the seismogenic<br/>portion of a subduction interface. A pilot study during the past year shows that such<br/>transients are occurring as frequently as every 12-24 months in this region, that<br/>some transients (1998 and 2004) originate far outside the Guerrero seismic gap, and<br/>that the transients may be accompanied by non-volcanic seismic tremors. Based on these<br/>previously unrecognized results, deployment for 24 months of an 8-station broadband<br/>seismic array and expansion of a regional continuous GPS array to include 4 critically<br/>located stations in a region where the transients appear to occur are planned. The<br/>new seismic array, which will span a<br/>broad gap between two dense seismic transects being installed as part of the already<br/>funded Caltech/UNAM Middle America Seismic Experiment, will allow detection and location<br/>of any episodic tremors in the study area. Continuous GPS measurements from the<br/>pre-existing GPS stations and nine new stations constructed by this group and<br/>collaborator Enrique Cabral of UNAM will provide critical complementary information<br/>about the source regions, magnitude, and timing of episodic slip. Data from an existing<br/>smaller-footprint 30-station continuous and campaign GPS array that DeMets and Cabral<br/>operate in Oaxaca above the Cocos-North America subduction interface will also be used<br/>to study in more detail deformation within a conspicuous seismic gap analogous to,<br/>but smaller than the well-known Guerrero seismic gap. The combined GPS and seismic<br/>arrays will be a powerful tool for studying subduction transients and non-volcanic<br/>tremor, and for imaging spatial and temporal variations in frictional coupling<br/>along the locked and transitional zones beneath our network. Brudzinski, who will be<br/>a new faculty member at Miami University of Ohio in August of 2005, will purchase the<br/>necessary seismic equipment with start-up funds from his faculty position and will<br/>have it prepared for a two-year deployment in early 2006. DeMets at UW-Madison will<br/>coordinate the GPS station installation with Dr. Cabral, as well as a modest expansion<br/>of the Oaxaca GPS network to improve coverage of the aforementioned seismic gap. The<br/>UW-Madison geophysics group has a long history of deploying seismic and GPS networks<br/>and will provide at no cost two expert technicians to help build and maintain the<br/>combined seismic and GPS network. Responsibilities for modeling of the geodetic and<br/>seismic observations will lie respectively with DeMets and Brudzinski.<br/>Broader impacts: Episodic tremor and slip are a newly observed phenomenon that appears<br/>to be related to many different aspects of earth science (seismology, tectonics,<br/>petrology, and geodynamics), with possible ramifications for understanding triggering<br/>of megathrust earthquakes. Students at Miami University will be offered a unique opportunity<br/>to participate in a field workshop course that will coincide with the initial seismic<br/>deployment, thereby exposing students to a geophysics field research.

In plants, microtubules become organized into four distinct arrays with varying functions.  It has recently been shown that microtubules in the cortical array become repositioned by a treadmilling motility mechanism that is driven by frequent cycles of microtubule plus end growth, pausing, and shortening (termed dynamic instability), and intermittent episodes of minus end depolymerization. An elucidation of microtubule end behavior is essential for understanding important aspects of microtubule organization and function. In animals and fungi, dynamic instability is regulated by a collection of proteins called +TIPS (plus end tracking proteins) that are preferentially localized to microtubule plus ends, where they also participate in capturing and moving cellular components. Little is known about what +TIPS exist in plants, let alone how they regulate dynamic instability and affect microtubule function. The Principal Investigators have recently identified a novel plant specific +TIP named SPIRAL1 (SPR1) in a forward genetics screen looking for Arabidopsis mutants affected in root cell expansion. The organs of spr1 mutants exhibit both touch induced and constitutive directional cell expansion defects that are enhanced by lower temperatures and suppressed by anti-microtubule drugs.   Sequence analyses show that the 12 kD SPR1 protein has five homologues in Arabidopsis, with these proteins having highly conserved direct repeat sequences at their amino and carboxy termini, separated by a region of low complexity that is predicted to form a rod-like structure. Given that a stably expressed SPR1:GFP fusion protein behaves like other GFP labeled +TIPS in that it preferentially localizes to growing microtubule plus ends and disperses upon microtubule shortening, the Principal Investigators predict that like those other +TIPS, SPR1 regulates microtubule dynamic instability, recruits proteins to microtubule plus ends, and/or links microtubules to other cellular structures. To test these hypotheses, important parameters of dynamic microtubule behavior will be analyzed in the spr1-6 null allele as well as in SPR1 over-expressing plants, using time-lapse confocal microscopy and fluorescent microtubule markers. It will be determined if SPR1 binds directly to microtubules by performing in vitro microtubule pull-down assays. A yeast two-hybrid system will be used to screen  libraries for SPR1 interacting proteins and to test candidate MAPs for SPR1 interactions. Particular focus will be placed on identifying the relationship between SPR1 and Arabidopsis homologues to the well-characterized animal EB1-like proteins, given that animal EB1 proteins have many binding partners and the Arabidopsis AtEB1 proteins exhibit localization dynamics similar to SPR1. Together, these experiments will allow the Principal Investigators to determine how SPR1 and other plant +TIPS participate in microtubule plus end function. This project should also provide insights into the poorly understood connection between microtubules and directional cell expansion in plants. The knowledge gained on +TIPS in plants may provide a perspective that aids in the understanding of +TIPS function in animals and fungi. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>The PIs will actively recruit individuals from underrepresented groups in science to participate in this project and receive training in basic research.  Project participants will include a female graduate student and a female undergraduate in Dr. Sedbrook's laboratory, and students recruited from local community colleges in Dr. Ehrhardt's laboratory. A subset of the experiments will be integrated into a biotechnology lab course run by Dr. Sedbrook that is designed to teach undergraduates and graduate students basic molecular techniques in a way that develops their critical thinking and troubleshooting skills. The Biological Sciences department at Illinois State University has recently purchased a Leica confocal microscope system with funds derived from an NSF equipment grant, so this project will allow the investigators to take full advantage of this important instrument for both research and teaching. Images and movies of dynamic microtubules in living plant cells generated from these studies will be used to enhance a variety of courses taught by the PI at Illinois State University and will be integrated into the Plant Cell Imaging web site created by the Dr. Ehrhardt. This web site features images and movies of living plant cells that reveal their fascinating inner life. This site has been profiled in Science magazine, and is used as a resource for teaching cell biology at several secondary and higher educational institutions around the country.<br/><br/>"

This research will design and evaluate an end-to-end prototype of a customized learning service for concept knowledge (CLICK) which will enable student-centered customizations by comparing learners' conceptual understanding, depicted as concept maps, with reference domain concept maps generated from digital library resources. These comparisons will enable learning environments to provide customized retrieval, delivery, and presentation of educational resources drawn from digital libraries.<br/><br/>This research will be conducted by a partnership between investigators at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the DLESE Program Center at UCAR. An expert study will be conducted to gather human data on reference concept map generation, comparison of student and reference concept maps, and selection of appropriate digital library resources for instructional remediation. These data will be used for developing and evaluating natural language processing algorithms that will automatically generate concept maps from DLESE resources and student work. Results from the expert study, combined with task-centered design methods, will inform the development of the CLICK service prototype. Finally, student learning will be assessed using behavioral and verbal data to address potential changes in learning processes and science understanding.<br/><br/>This research extends current theories and techniques in adaptive learning environments. Primary outcomes of this research include the CLICK conceptual framework and the CLICK Service prototype.

It is known that rough surfaces wear quickly, but how smooth should surfaces be to make better electrical contacts for switches and relays? The approach is to test surfaces with nanometer-scale roughness to which are applied thin-film coatings, including carbon nanotubes grown directly on the contact testing along with a special apparatus for evaluating coated surfaces samples to choose candidate materials for high-cycle testing. The contracts will be evaluated at regular intervals to develop an understanding of their long-term surface behavior. Mathematical models will be made to predict performance and used to help design longer lasting lower resistance miniature electrical switches.<br/><br/>The societal impact of this research includes educational and industrial benefits. Modern society cannot function without electronics, and electronic devices cannot function without reliable high quality switches. As electronics shrink, so must the switches. Educationally, a recent MIT Ph.D. graduate, who has been teaching inner-city high school students, and students, from OSU and MIT will work together to develop new nanoscience-centered teaching materials for use in core math an science classes.

The Center will develop theory and empirical research that can encompass (a) the rapid emergence of new technologies and types of professional work that involve mathematical description and analysis, (b) the challenges of providing all students with equitable access to powerful forms of mathematical thinking, and (c) the need to prepare learners for the increasingly unpredictable demands of work and public life. Center participants bring active research agendas in these areas to the catalyst project. Drawing from a broad array of new research in the social, behavioral and brain sciences, the Center will develop a coordinated program of research on interactive, physical, and embodied aspects of participating in purposeful mathematical activity. These include field and laboratory studies of how vision, gaze, touch, body motion, gesture, drawing, and symbolic derivation are involved in mathematical analysis and argumentation. These studies will pay particular attention to the role of physical/computational devices in the teaching and learning of mathematics. The Center will conduct three on-site workshops, starting at Vanderbilt University and then on university campuses in southern and northern California. Leading up to these workshops, Center participants will engage in three online seminars. The purpose of these seminars is to review relevant literature in participants' home disciplines, use shared empirical cases to ground theoretical discussion (e.g., cases drawn from prior research in classroom, workplace, and laboratory settings), to develop a set of theoretical papers that will frame work of center participants, and to develop a coordinated research program on embodied mathematical cognition for a multi-year science of learning research center."

Specifically, we will use Xenon buffer layer assisted MBE (molecular beam epitaxy) growth to prepare Co/ nanodots with precisely tunable size and density on conjugated polymer thin films. Then, the spin-dependent transport across Co/polymer nano-heterojunction will be studied as a function of temperature by using four-tip STM (scanning tunneling microscope). In addition, polymer light-emitting diodes (LEDs) will be used as a tool to study how spin injection affects the singlet and triplet exciton formation and singlettriplet intersystem crossing in conjugated polymers based on steady and transient electroluminescence and photoluminescence. The goal is to increase the critical understanding of spin injection mechanism and to develop a new methodology of controlling exciton formation by using ferromagnetic nanoscale spin injector.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The proposed studies of spin transport across the Co/polymer nano-heterojunction expects to elucidate the spin transport processes at the interface between ferromagnetic nanosize electrode and organic semiconductor polymer thin film. The understanding of the spin injection mechanism is critically important for the fabrication of efficient spin injectors in organic semiconductor devices. Especially, efficient spin injection will create a new pathway to magnetically control the singlet and triplet exciton formation and relevant optoelectronic properties in conjugated polymers. Therefore, the project will impact the light-emitting, lasing, and photovoltaic properties in easy-processing and property-tunable polymer semiconductor devices. <br/><br/>Broad impact: The research consists of cross-field investigations and thus will provide multi-disciplinary training in optics, electronics, and magnetism to the involved graduate and undergraduate students. To further enhance its educational impact, new course work of spin transport will be developed for Polymer Physics (MSE 543) and Optoelectronic Processes in Polymeric Materials and Devices (MSE 674) at the University of Tennessee (UT). The project will also continue to demonstrate the concepts and principles of polymer optoelectronic devices to high school students through the Materials Camp co-sponsored by UT Department of Materials Science and Engineering."

Furthermore, the project provides support for registration of schemes and schemas for use by human and machine agents, as well as support for the machine mapping of relationships among terms and concepts in those schemes (semantic mappings) and schemas (crosswalks). The intellectual merit of the project lies in its use of distributed registries of metadata schemes and schemas to improve services to users in an increasingly heterogeneous Web digital library universe; and it points to an environment where important semantic connections between diverse communities and their vocabularies are effectively enabled. The broader impact of the project is its generalization of registry software and implementation beyond centrally controlled metadata schemas. This enables the distribution of appropriate control and management into the hands of vocabulary creators and maintainers, thus facilitating the potential to overcome economic and legal barriers that have prevented the anticipated growth of registries and distributed registry networks."

One of the most poorly understood issues in subduction zones is the interaction between subducted lithosphere and the mantle transition zone (TZ). In particular, the amount of slab penetration across the 660-km discontinuity controls the rate of heat<br/>and mass transfer between the upper and lower mantle. This process is central to understanding thermal convection and chemical mixing of the mantle, including the continual search for a primordial mantle. The southwest Pacific presents a natural laboratory to examine the fate of subducted plates, as rapid subduction of old, cold lithosphere has been on-going to provide ample signal for understanding the slab-TZ interaction process. Moreover, abundant seismicity within the subducting lithosphere emits seismic waves that can illuminate properties and structure of the subduction zone. The only problem restricting studies in this region has been the lack of seismometers to record the frequent events, leaving researchers with limited means to directly sample the subducting slabs and examine the source of seismicity. It has recently come to light that Dr. Robert Pillet at the Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD) in Noumea, New Caledonia has been responsible for maintaining the Cavascope array of broad bandwidth (high-resolution) seismic instruments across New Caledonia and Vanuatu<br/>precisely where abundant seismicity can be used to probe the deep subduction zone. Pillet and the IRD-Noumea have agreed to release a portion of proprietary data from the entire Cavascope network for Brudzinski and Pillet to perform several in situ experiments to advance the understanding of how subducted lithosphere interacts with the bottom of the TZ and the origin of deep earthquakes. Broader Impacts include a partnership between a well-trained scientist in a developing nation with high-quality data but limited means for completing scientific projects, as well as a broader collaboration with other researchers in mineral physics, geodynamics, and seismology.

It faces three challenges: to compile sufficient data, to integrate<br/>multiple databases, and to maintain tools that can assemble all the local data records into a geologic time<br/>line. The third challenge amounts to sequencing the fossil record and we propose to address three of the<br/>obstacles it faces: (1) Fossil biotas of the same age may differ as a result of habitat and preservation<br/>effects; (2) Very large data sets must be sequenced in smaller pieces and the results stitched seamlessly<br/>together; (3) Increasing numbers of dated and fingerprinted ash beds need to used more effectively. We<br/>propose a case study of manageable geographic and temporal extent that, nevertheless, raises these same<br/>issues. The Ordovician and Silurian periods span almost 100 million years of early Paleozoic time and are<br/>traditionally subdivided by graptolites and conodonts - two fossil clades with different ecological and<br/>preservational traits that restrict their use to largely mutually exclusive domains.<br/>The Mohawkian (Late Ordovician) of eastern North America presents precisely the type of<br/>challenging geological environment in which to build and test the temporal sequencing and stitching<br/>approaches that we envision. Mohawkian strata are widely exposed in the region and yield a rich fossil<br/>record that includes diverse, but somewhat endemic, conodont faunas. The epicratonic succession is<br/>rimmed along the Appalachian margin by deeper water sediments of the Taconic foreland basin. These<br/>strata contain a suite of inter-continentally distributed graptolite faunas, but few described conodont<br/>assemblages. Numerous altered volcanic ash deposits (K-bentonites) link these facies through a set of<br/>transitional facies along the interior basin margin. Despite these advantages, the prevalence of short<br/>sections, structural complexity, and facies limitation of the faunas impedes precise and reliable correlation<br/>between the cratonic and basinal successions, consequently limiting our ability to compare their disparate<br/>faunas and tectonic histories.<br/>Intellectual Merit: We propose to combine (1) geochemical fingerprinting (tephrochronology) and<br/>U-Pb geochronology of K-bentonites from the Mohawkian and early Cincinnatian with (2) a restudy of<br/>late Mohawkian conodonts and graptolites from eleven regions across eastern North America and (3)<br/>computer assisted sequencing of the global Ordovician conodont and graptolite fossil record. This work<br/>will provide a detailed temporal and paleoecological framework within which to refine the application of<br/>biofacies information to the temporal sequencing of the fossil record via rigorous quantitative techniques.<br/>We will focus in steps 1 and 2 particularly on conodont and graptolite-bearing successions that contain Kbentonites,<br/>and especially on regions where conodonts and graptolites occur in close association.<br/>The results of our work in a time interval that remains troublesome in spite of a wide range of timestratigraphic<br/>information will bear upon fundamental questions in both local and global stratigraphy. In<br/>the course of this study we will test existing alternate correlation models for the mid Upper Ordovician of<br/>central and eastern North America. The results will provide an improved, age-calibrated basis for studies<br/>of faunal turnover and diversity change in the Ordovician and Silurian. Most importantly, the work will<br/>lead to the development of improved techniques for time scale construction and validation.<br/>Broader Impact: The data and tools we develop will be shared immediately through the CHRONOS<br/>project and will investigate technological solutions that are not being addressed by CHRONOS to<br/>sequence events. The project meets the EARTHTIME goal of cross-training stratigraphers and<br/>geochronologists in developing high precision time-scales. We will train two PhD students (one a<br/>minority), and three undergraduates. We will integrate the efforts of four institutions, two with large<br/>minority enrolment (UCR, UALR), in a new collaboration that will facilitate the interaction of all the<br/>students and PIs at each institution. Undergraduates will participate as field and lab assistants for the PIs<br/>and for the graduate students, and will be given pieces of the project as senior research projects. Each<br/>student will present aspects of the research at a professional meeting. The project will also include a<br/>secondary school teacher who will work alongside PI Leslie during the summer as part of the Arkansas<br/>STRIVE program. The teacher will develop class projects based on their experiences. The project thus<br/>impacts future generations of students by enhancing a secondary education teacher's knowledge base and<br/>scientific curriculum."

The robot carries several types of sensors, which allow detection of incipient faults.<br/><br/>This project is original and innovative in many ways. For the first time, a robotic platform will be used to provide damage assessment of electric power cables in-situ after adverse environmental conditions. Also, for the first time, the data collected along the length of the cable will be used to correlate cable condition assessed from terminal measurements.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit. The proposed approach will make more realistic the vision of multi-robot systems that patrol distributed infrastructures, ensuring their safety and reliability. The post-flood status of the electric power cable system in New Orleans will be difficult to evaluate. No matter what remedial actions are taken after the disaster, the rebuilding of infrastructure will pose many questions regarding replacement of components, longevity of new components, and salvaging of already installed base. The proposed project will add knowledge to the mosaic of damage assessment conducted with both traditional and highly innovative methods. Answering the questions of what causes cable failures and at which rate has become particularly important for the New Orleans case. The proposed project will not only help answering these questions, but also will help determining the future design approaches for power industry. <br/><br/>Broader impact. The PI will use this project as a vehicle to demonstrate technology challenges and solutions in an undergraduate course (EE 401, Engineering Creativity and Innovation), in the graduate seminar (EE 500V, Energy Seminar), and in a K-12 robotics program that PI is supporting with Roosevelt High School in Seattle. The results of this project will form a fascinating story of the behavior of distributed infrastructure under adverse environmental conditions and will serve as a great example for the enhancement of engineering profession. The interdisciplinary efforts of civil, environmental, electrical, and mechanical engineers will be clearly presented to technical and to general audiences. It is worth noting that poster presenting the concept and preliminary results of the proposed approach took first place in International Student Poster Contest in the IEEE General Meeting 2005, San Francisco. The overall audience reaction was that if the proposed approach is highly promising and requires additional field studies at critical areas."

Most bacteria live by creating habitats on the surface of solid particles such as minerals, which may be located in soil, subsurface, or aquatic environments. Bacteria perceive the presence of mineral surfaces through force ""cues"", which allow a cell to physically feel another surface. While inter- and intra-molecular forces dominate the lives of microorganisms, their seemingly infinitesimal magnitude and length-scale have made them difficult to study. This proposed research will begin to shed light onto this problem though a unique combination of molecular modeling, force measurements, and microscopic images of well-characterized silica minerals and bacteria that have been genetically modified to produce specific cell wall macromolecules. <br/><br/>First, the natural distribution, density, and acid-base reactivity of functional groups on specific faces of phyllosilicate and silicate crystals (and possibly also on the surface of a bacterium) will be determined with atomic force titration measurements. These measurements will be interpreted with a new method for predicting acid-base reactivity of individual functional groups that involves ab initio structure calculations. Second, atomic force microscopy will be used to measure intermolecular forces between wild-type and mutant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and silicate minerals. These force measurements will be interpreted in light of the previously obtained molecular-scale models of the mineral surface acid-base reactivities. The intellectual merit of this proposal is that the combination of molecular models with force measurements will allow an unprecedented view of the fundamental forces or cues that exist at the interface between a living bacterium and mineral surface in situ. This goal will be accomplished through the collective efforts of our interdisciplinary research team that includes scientists specializing in geochemistry, mineralogy and molecular modeling (Bickmore and Lewis), geomicrobiology and nanoscience (Lower and Beveridge), and physical force laws (Dutcher and Israelachvili). <br/><br/> The microorganism used in these experiments, P. aeruginosa, is a model Gram negative bacterium. It is ubiquitous in water, soil, and subsurface environments where it lives on the surface of minerals or other particles. It is also a common bacteria species on plants and animals, where it often functions as an opportunistic pathogen. The minerals used in these experiments include silicates, which are the most common inorganic phases on Earth. Probing the interface between P. aeruginosa and silicate minerals will have broader implications and societal benefits that can be applied to issues ranging from the transport of microorganisms in aquifers to the formation of biofilms on solid substrates. Further, this proposal will impact the lives of a number of graduate students and undergraduates. These students will be cross trained in biochemistry, microbiology, geochemistry, and mineralogy, and they will also gain experience with state-of-the-art instruments such as scanning probe microscopes, laser scanning microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Finally, this proposal will provide funds to support K-6 outreach programs that are designed to expose young students to the interplay between the biological and physical sciences."

Two opposing theories about why this might be are: <br/>Life first arose in a hydrothermal environment, possibly in the deep subsurface.<br/>Thermophiles preferentially survived the ""late heavy bombardment"" of the Hadean Earth. <br/>Since no sedimentary record survives from this period, it is not possible to address these theories directly through geology. Instead, we must look to modern geomicrobial processes to better understand controls on, and modes of, thermophilic life. Armed with this understanding, geological records may eventually yield more information on the physiological capabilities and nature of early life.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses geomicrobial processes at interfaces between mildly reducing hydrothermal fluids and oxidizing surface sediments or waters. Specifically, we will use a combination of molecular, chemical, and isotopic methods to identify the geomicrobial associations, metabolic strategies, nutrient, and energy requirements and geochemical signatures of streamer and biofilm-forming communities (SBC) of thermophilic and chemolithotrophic Bacteria and Archaea.<br/><br/>We will address the following questions:<br/>1) What is the physiochemical basis for the occurrence of biofilm-forming Aquificales? <br/>2) What is their primary carbon source and mode of carbon assimilation?<br/>3) What are the identities of the Crenarchaeota that appear to co-colonize these systems?<br/>4) Is there a co-dependence of these microbes and, if so, what is its basis?<br/>5) Can biosignatures be used to distinguish thermophilic and mesophilic communities?<br/>6) Might these systems leave a molecular record that could be traced back in time?<br/><br/>Scientific Merit: Through this research, we will learn more about the physiological basis for life at high temperatures and the characteristic biosignatures of thermophilic microbes. In particular, we will seek to discern if there is a symbiosis or simply a physical co-habitation of thermophilic Aquificales and Crenarchaea in the SBCs of Yellowstone National Park. These organisms occupy a special niche at the interface of hot, sub-subsurface hydrothermal fluids and a ""cold"" and oxidizing atmosphere. In seeking to increase understanding of microbes and biogeochemical processes operating at this interface and the strategies used to derive energy and nutrients, our proposal is firmly aligned with the aims and objectives of the Biogeosciences Program. In combining cutting-edge geochemical and microbiological approaches, we will also be generally improving methods and research techniques for the study of geomicrobial processes. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This proposal focuses on teaching and training and will support the training of a new postdoctoral investigator and graduate student at MIT and will provide unparalleled research opportunities for undergraduates interested in the biogeosciences, including significant collaborative interactions in the field and laboratory at three institutions. Providing meaningful and positive research experiences in multidisciplinary science to college undergraduates is critical to fostering the next generation of researchers and educators. Because the focal point of our research is one of the US's most visited national parks, there will be enhanced opportunities for public dissemination of our results. We will work directly with the Park Service to develop educational materials, including scientifically sound treatment of the philosophical and practical aspects of fundamental research pertaining to ""origins of life"" and ""limits of life"" concepts."

In many cases, the rate of conversion of bedrock to regolith controls not only the rate of lowering of the landscape, but its shape as well. While conceptual models of regolith production are well established, the empirical observations needed to support these conceptual models are few. A mechanistic understanding of the process of regolith formation remains a matter of conjecture. Similarly, few empirical studies provide sufficient constraint on a process-based understanding of regolith transport. An overarching question, What is the dependence of regolith production rate on regolith thickness? reflects the reigning paradigm, in which regolith thickness is the controlling parameter. Clearly, thickness is a proxy for other variables, such as water contact time and chemical saturation state, and freeze-thaw cycle frequency. The interaction of mechanical and chemical processes that produce and transport regolith will be explored in a simple landscape: the alpine high surfaces in the Front Range of Colorado. These high surfaces are an ideal laboratory because their parabolic shape implies that they are steady state landforms, the regolith is thin and accessible and is generated from granitoid rock, and easily characterized frost processes are expected to dominate the mechanical processes. <br/>The approach used is to document the chemical development and mechanical properties in the rock and regolith, paying particular attention to the interface between these materials. Modern and several-thousand year process rates will be documented; all strongly constrain conceptual and numerical models of landscape evolution. Current chemical and physical processes will be monitored with soil water samplers, moisture probes, temperature strings, frost-heave sensors, and strain gauges. Sampling sites will be arrayed along a transect down a parabolic, steady state hillslope. Topography (using laser altimetry) and snow cover will be documented in detail, and variations in regolith thickness and chemical evolution surveyed. Long-term rates of regolith production and its motion down slope will be documented using the concentration of cosmogenic 10Be in bedrock and regolith profiles, respectively. <br/>An existing model of regolith production will be refined by incorporation of the specific processes documented in this study. The development of this model will integrate the field measurements outlined, and the information gleaned from modern and long-term process data. This will require attention to thermal, hydrologic, and chemical processes. The model will serve as a test of the process understanding developed from the field data.<br/>Broader Impacts. This work will be used in teaching at CU, outreach to the public, and training graduate and undergraduate students in research. One graduate student and 2 undergraduate students will be exposed to surface processes research, including analysis of laser altimetry, cosmogenic nuclide dating, field monitoring, and numerical modeling. As the site is close to CU, lectures, lab exercises and field trips will be possible. Data will be made available through the web sites of the PIs and through that of the Niwot Ridge LTER. The PIs are committed to taking their science to the broader public. Simulations of landscape evolution are being shared (see sample simulations of both glaciers and tor-dotted ridges at http://instaar.colorado.edu/rmnp). The model of alpine hillslopes produced will add understanding of the interactions of chemical and physical processes in eroding landscapes."

Therefore, their verification must be done in a feature oriented framework. Meanwhile, Cluster Analysis (CA) is aimed at identifying clusters or features in any data. As such, it is natural to utilize CA for precipitation verification. The objectives of this research are to develop 1) a CA methodology to identify clusters/features in spatial forecast and observation fields, taking into account multiple scales and attributes, and 2) a verification methodology for automatically matching the observed and forecast features. <br/><br/>Methods: To devise CA methods suited to the identification of the types of clusters/features appearing in meteorological fields (e.g., precipitation), model-based CA will be examined. The matching (i.e., verifying) of the clusters identified in the forecast field to those in the observation field will be performed within the framework of CA by computing different measures of the distance between the clusters. These methods will be compared with more conventional approaches, and to a ""hand-verified"" benchmark. The methodology will be tested on a series of mesoscale NWP precipitation forecasts acquired from the University of Washington mesoscale short-range ensemble system, and from the an advanced Department of Defense numerical mesoscale ensemble system. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts The Applied Physics Laboratory and the department of statistics at the University of Washington are partners in a 5-year Multi University Research Initiative (MURI). This has provided for a ripe environment for exploring all matters dealing with verification, and has attracted a wide range of students interested in statistical aspects of weather forecasting. As such, the research will promote teaching, training, and learning through involvement and participation of a graduate student focusing in statistical aspects of weather forecasting.

The program involves more than 600 students in 100 peer-facilitated, problem-focused workshops across 5 disciplines. It targets ""gateway"" science courses in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Math and Engineering. These are highly demanding, introductory-level courses that students must pass to major in STEM disciplines. <br/>This project is establishing an Extended Science Workshop (ESW) program to capitalize on the existing GSW infrastructure and expertise to establish a peer-facilitated workshop program in key second- and third-year courses: the Organic Chemistry 210 and 212 sequences as well as Biochemistry 309 and Cell Biology 315 sequences. These course sequences are required for chemistry and biology majors and typically have large enrollments, with 75 to 300 students per sequence. In the first year of the grant, the project team is launching the full ESW program in Organic Chemistry 210 and piloting the program in Organic Chemistry 212. In subsequent years the team is scheduled to pilot and fully implement the program in all (four) course sequences. At that point the project reaches its full level of activity, supporting 20 workshops in Organic Chemistry and 10 workshops in Biochemistry and Cell Biology, and impacting approximately 200 students per year. Throughout the period of the grant, the team is continuing to develop support structures both for peer facilitators who run the individual workshops and for the participating faculty who develop workshop problems and train facilitators in the required disciplinary knowledge. The management plan indicates this project is fully sustainable beyond the period of NSF support. This is to be achieved by fully embedding the ESW program within the institution by the end of the grant period. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. While a number of programs exist at U.S. universities to help students in introductory STEM courses succeed, less attention has been paid to critical second-year courses. The program's research and evaluation efforts are advancing understanding of the theory and practice of implementing and institutionalizing small-group, problem-focused, peer-facilitated learning initiatives alongside the traditional science curriculum in higher education STEM disciplines. In particular, the team is examining not just the impact of the ESW program on students' grades and retention, but also examining the subjective experience of students enrolled in the program, an aspect of academic life that may be particularly important for students from underrepresented groups. The project has brought together a highly qualified team of scientists, educators, and administrators who are uniquely positioned to build on their six-year experience in the creation, evaluation, and continuous improvement of workshop-based, learning-centered initiatives for science students. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Through its strategies to increase the graduation rate of highly skilled undergraduates in STEM disciplines, the ESW program is providing exceptional opportunities for students to develop more sophisticated approaches to studying, for peer mentors to hone facilitation skills and experience the fulfillment of teaching, and for participating faculty to rethink the way they approach teaching. Moreover, building on the success of GSW with students from underrepresented groups, the ESW program is helping to increase the numbers of minority students succeeding in STEM courses and remaining in the sciences. The program is also building interdepartmental relationships and a network of trained undergraduate leaders who are playing a key role in the program. The ESW team is building on existing knowledge and disseminating new knowledge through continued conference presentations and scholarly papers, in both education- and science-oriented forums."

This project puts forward a comprehensive, multidisciplinary research approach to characterize and model human cognitive driving behavior and subsequent response in traffic flow systems. Specifically, the dynamics of driver behavior, taken at the individual level and as part of a group, evolving over time and space will be systematically studied as a complex system. By developing behavior-based models of human decision-making in traffic situations and integrating the behavior models in computer simulation systems, the study addresses fundamental questions in traffic science and promises to improve prevailing understanding of traffic flow phenomena as well as the fidelity and reliability of the current state of the art of traffic flow simulation. The outcome of the project will reveal the interrelationship between microscopic elements of driver behavior (e.g. reaction times and other time lags, over-reaction, risk averse and risk seeking behaviors in car following and lane changing) and macroscopic traffic flow phenomena through analytical investigation and simulation, validated by field observation. The subject of the investigation entails considerable economic and social significance, with wide application in human cognitive science, as well as in traffic operations and management.

Tierney at the University of New Mexico to investigate a library of model compounds, encompassing 4-, 5- and 6-coordination, by a combination of x-ray absorption spectroscopy and paramagnetic resonance (PMR). An integrated approach to PMR would be used simultaneously applying mutli-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). PMR would be used to define the field- and temperature-dependence of electron-nuclear hyperfine interactions in a broad array of hs Co(II) systems. Electronic relaxation will be examined by field- and temperature-dependent NMR relaxation and by NMR dispersion (NMRD). The behavior of the model systems will guide spectroscopic studies of systems of unknown structure, where x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will provide additional, critical structural constraints. The systems for initial focus mimic two key structural elements in the metallobiochemistry of cobalt - Co-Nhistidine and Co-Scysteine. To emulate metal-histidine interactions, we will study a series of bis- (Bp) and tris- (Tp) pyrazolylborate complexes. Efforts to model Co-Scys interactions will involve common alkyl- and arylthiolate small-molecule chemistry. To bridge the gap between small-molecule and metalloprotein studies, a set of de novo metal-binding peptides, designed to present four cysteine or penicillamine thiolates as potential ligands, will be examined. <br/><br/>The application of ENDOR spectroscopy to hs Co(II) systems will help lay the foundation for the full development of Co(II) as a spectroscopic probe of Zn(II) metalloenzymes.

Specifically, the project is comparing and contrasting STEM programs that are successful with those that are not as successful in graduating underrepresented populations in STEM fields. College degree program culture is measured using mixed methods and at multiple levels employing both qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques. This research is guided by the following questions:<br/>1. What contextual (e.g., cultural/climate) factors in STEM programs affect students' motivation and ability to successfully complete college degrees in these areas?<br/>2. Do these factors differentially impact female students and members of underrepresented minorities?<br/>3. How do students' self-reported reasons for leaving a STEM program compare with<br/>objective, independent measures of the program climate/culture?<br/>4. Which specific culture/climate differences between programs and schools are<br/>associated with these programs' success graduating females and minority students?<br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The research represents the state-of-the-art in organizational culture and climate research. As such, it has the potential not only to contribute to the knowledge base concerning education and STEM careers, but also to contribute more broadly to the literature on organizational culture and climate and the ways in which they affect important organizational outcomes. The measurement of culture is difficult and time consuming, and this diverse team of anthropologists, industrial psychologists and sociologists is uniquely qualified to collect high quality program culture information. By building on the team's current research using archival databases in Florida, this research can be conducted efficiently as well. Finally, and most importantly, the current state of knowledge concerning how STEM programs affect a student's motivation and ability to complete STEM programs is limited, even though it is widely believed that the program context is important. The research will result in a comprehensive understanding of those aspects of the culture, climate, and practices in STEM departments and degree programs that support and enhance student retention and STEM degree completion, particularly for members of underrepresented groups.<br/>Broader Impact<br/>The research questions being addressed in this study have implications for higher education policy throughout the U.S., in terms of developing interventions that focus on improving degree program culture and other contextual factors to increase undergraduate students' interests in and ability to obtain degrees in STEM fields. The research also bridges research with practice by developing a partnership between USF education researchers and the Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, a program focused on increasing numbers of STEM bachelor's degree recipients. In addition, since women and minorities are the fastest growing sectors of the U.S. workforce, it is imperative to attract and maintain their interest in STEM education and careers. Results of this research will provide the knowledge base needed to improve interventions that seek to increase STEM student recruitment and retention, particularly for women and minorities, and this can promote a healthy economy by ensuring a diverse and well-qualified STEM workforce. Results will be disseminated widely not only to the academic community but also directly to the educators and policy makers who are working to build the future STEM workforce."

Over the last five years several research<br/>groups have provided detailed characterizations of the static geochemical characteristics of groundwater<br/>and sediments in arsenic-contaminated aquifers. The challenge now is to determine how groundwater<br/>flow transports chemicals in and out of the subsurface, and hence controls subsurface<br/>biogeochemistry. We propose to develop novel hydrologic methods to characterize the complex spatial<br/>and temporal patterns of groundwater flow, and then to employ hydrogeologic models to study the<br/>evolution of groundwater geochemistry. By combining dynamic hydrological models with geochemical<br/>characterization we intend to answer key scientific questions that have thus far eluded us:<br/>Why has arsenic not been flushed from some aquifers? Combined estimates of groundwater<br/>residence times and arsenic retardation factors indicate that arsenic residence times are only decades to<br/>centuries, implying that arsenic should be flushed from the aquifers that are thousands of years old. Is<br/>dissolved arsenic supplied by a continuous source, or are high concentrations transient?<br/>Will arsenic concentrations change in the future? Our field injection-withdrawal experiments show that<br/>arsenic concentrations respond within days to biochemical perturbations. The adoption of dry-season<br/>rice cultivation has dramatically altered geochemical input and outputs from aquifers. How does this<br/>change affect subsurface geochemistry and dissolved arsenic concentrations?<br/>Why do arsenic concentrations differ between neighboring wells? Arsenic concentrations at nearby<br/>locations in grey-colored anoxic aquifers often differ greatly, despite similar sediment characteristics. Do<br/>these dramatic gradients result from the pattern of groundwater flow and recharge?<br/>What are the intellectual merits of the proposed activity?<br/>These questions can only be resolved by determining how groundwater dynamics control<br/>chemical input and output to aquifers over two timescales: (1) Seasonal cycle: The hydrology of Bangladesh<br/>annually cycles between Monsoon flooding and dry-season arid conditions when evapotranspiration<br/>greatly outstrips precipitation and irrigation water is pumped from aquifers to meet the transpiration<br/>demands of crops. This cycle drives water table oscillations that create seasonally varying oxic/anoxic<br/>conditions in soils and also drives water exchange between aquifers and surface water (rice paddies,<br/>ponds and rivers). (2) Anthropogenic changes over decades: The Ganges Delta has been<br/>dramatically altered over the last three decades by population growth and the advent of irrigated<br/>agriculture. Groundwater irrigation has changed the location, timing and chemical content of recharge.<br/>Anoxic irrigation water is ponded in rice fields over much of the land, thereby changing both the<br/>hydrologic budget and the biogeochemistry of recharge, potentially mobilizing arsenic from soil layers that<br/>may be rich in arsenic and iron (oxy)hydroxides. Furthermore, pumping changes flow-paths deep in<br/>aquifers, affecting both the rates and locations of recharge as well as groundwater exchange with surface<br/>water bodies that now receive much higher loads of untreated waste.<br/>We propose to: (1) Build on our successful field program in Bangladesh by extending our field<br/>characterization from vertical geochemical profiles at one location to three dimensional flow around this<br/>location; (2) Characterize recharge and discharge and map transient flow-paths through the aquifer by<br/>applying novel combination of natural isotope data and numerical inverse methods for groundwater flow;<br/>(3) Conduct a detailed study of geochemical fluxes through the bottom of a rice field, now a principle<br/>source of groundwater recharge at our site, and a very likely source of dissolved arsenic; (4) Construct<br/>predictive numerical models that couple groundwater flow and recharge with the biogeochemical<br/>transformations that control arsenic.<br/>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?<br/>This collaborative project is built on our successful and productive partnership over the last five<br/>years. We will continue to place a significant emphasis on the education and transfer of technology, with<br/>further exchange of students between BUET, MIT and Tufts. We also will continue to collaborate with<br/>other research groups including Stanford, EAWAG in Switzerland, UBC in Vancouver and UCLA.

There are over 200 gas stations and small industrial facilities in the area that have been flooded, and the buried gas tanks at these locations raise serious environmental and safety concerns for the citizens of New Orleans. Failed underground tanks can contaminate the groundwater and drinking water supplies, and pose a long-term health hazard. If the underground tanks have not been properly installed and anchored there is a danger of these tanks popping out of the ground. Given the mass exodus of residents in response to the evacuation orders, it is very likely that the tanks in the gas stations were empty or close to being empty prior to the disaster. This increases the potential for the popping effect to occur since the tanks are quite buoyant when empty. <br/>This SGER effort is directed towards documenting the condition of the underground gas storage tanks in the portion of New Orleans that have experienced severe flooding. It is anticipated that there are about 75 gas stations and small industrial facilities in the heavily flooded zone. The study will focus only on the integrity of the tanks in place and will not deal with the entry of floodwaters into the tank through the vent or inlet pipes and the release of the gas into the floodwaters. Evacuation of the moisture from the tanks will be a major challenge given the large number of facilities involved. To the extent possible, information will be gathered about the anchoring system and installation methods used for both the failed tank assemblies and those that have not failed. <br/>The intellectual merit of the effort lies in: (a) the assessment of the installation methods and anchoring systems contributing to a specific behavior of these tanks under flood conditions; and (b) the investigation of the influence of the soil type and conditions - at the sites considered - on the performance of the underground tanks.<br/>The broader impact of the proposed effort lies in: (1) assisting the local and state agencies involved in approving the installation and operation of these underground tanks; (2) engaging graduate students in the data collection effort to enhance their appreciation of the design and performance of the anchoring and installation systems used for these underground tanks; and (3) utilizing the information gathered in this study in undergraduate design classes to bring about greater awareness of a system that is not normally considered in design courses.<br/>The results of the effort will be disseminated in technical meetings, archival publications, and be made accessible through the Civil Engineering Department website for use by researchers in further studies on the performance and failure of the bridge system."

With the recent resurgence of interest in ethnographic research, projects are again being conducted in multi-sited teans, although by and large ethnographers still more often go into the field alone. Regardless of whether in teams or alone, some ethnographic scholars continue to press for methodological strategies that allow for the development of sociological claims that are generalizable and propose steps to replicate or return to sites of investigation over time. The study seeks to explore whether the team model of ethnogrpahic fieldwork improves the validity of ethnographic fieldwork. The quasi-experiment will be conducted as a part of an ongoing study of the development of a system for managing environmental, health and hazards in scientific laboratories. The research compares the presence and consequences of a surveillance and audit system in different scientific fields to address questions about the role of law and the processes of organizations and cultural diffusion in varying scientific cultures. The project addresses questions at the interface of the sociology of organizations, science and law. Might the creation of management system specifically designed to accommodate the particular cultures of research laboratories create consistent conformity with enviromental regulations? What is the effect on the relationships within laboratory work groups? If equal employment opportunity law has produced relative homogeneity in personnel practices in American workplaces because the responsible professionals have become astute interpreters of their organizations and imaginative legal innovators, will the introduction of environmental health and safety officers into laboratories produce similar organizational changes?

We have developed a new focus in nanoscale science and engineering, studying the synthesis, characterization, and simulations of nanoscale materials systems. Currently, we are capitalizing on the research partnerships with University of Florida and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in order use their facilities to carry out major research work on nano-structured materials. While this has been of tremendous assistance, the current volume of our research activities necessitates an in-house low kV, nanoscale resolution Field Emission - Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) capability. The functionality provided by the FE-SEM is currently not available in our facility. This includes imaging, texture and composition characterizations at nanoscales. For example, it is possible to obtain ultra high resolution (1.0 nm) at 15kV, high resolution (1.5nm) at 1 kV, map surface and near surface composition with a nanoscale precision, and perform nano-texture analysis on various materials with the equipment. Some of the research projects that will benefit directly from the FE-SEM acquisition include: 1) Synthesis, development and characterization of high strength carbon nanotube based composites for basic research and heat sink applications in computer CPUs, 2) Fundamental studies of alloy deformation, which will enable us develop physical theory of crystal plasticity, 3) Magnetic field alignment of superconductors (e.g. Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8), 4) Cellular and tissue engineering, and 5) Evolution of nanostructure and nanotexture in laminate composites. These composites are subjected to severe plastic deformation during processing, and the sub-micron structure developed can not be studied using standard SEM. The acquisition of a FE-SEM will enhance the diverse materials efforts at FAMU and FSU, and provide a cohesive base for the multitude of interdisciplinary research activities among these institutions. The opportunity to work with such state of the art equipment will help us interest more students in this field. The PIs have a proven record of mentoring women and minority students - there are currently twenty one undergraduate and seven graduate students on our NSF funded PREM program. <br/><br/><br/>Nanotechnology involves the study of the composition and behavior of materials at the microscopic and submicroscopic level. With this electron microscope, we will have the capacity to magnify the structure of samples to up to one million times their actual size. There are countless applications that will benefit from this research, with perhaps the most interesting being the development of carbon nanotubes. These tubes are very thin (as much as 10,000 times smaller than a human hair) and light, yet are exceedingly strong, giving them the potential to replace current materials in many engineering areas, such as aerospace engineering or other applications where a very high strength to weight ratio is required. Nanotechnology also has great possibilities in other fields such as biomedical engineering. The expanded capabilities that will come through the acquisition of the equipment will not only benefit our research, but will also benefit our educational programs as well. With an enrollment of approximately 50% minority students and 25% female students, we are dedicated to increasing the percentage of underrepresented minorities in the engineering workforce. The opportunity to work with such state of the art equipment will help us interest more students in the materials field and will better prepare our students to enter the workforce."

In the 1960s, U.S. automobile manufacturers faced two sets of demands to change their cars. One centered on making cars safer and resulted in the passage of the Highway Safety Act of 1966, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, and the Highway Safety Act of 1970. This last act created the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which soon mandated that automobile manufacturers provide ""passive"" protection technologies for front-seat occupants of new cars. The second set of demands centered on lowering harmful auto emissions and contributed to passage of the 1965 Clean Air Act Amendments, the Air Quality Act (1967), the National Environmental Policy Act (1969), and the Clear Air Act (1970). Implementing and enforcing the Clear Air Act fell to the new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These events constitute what is as close to an ideal ""natural experiment"" for the historian and analyst of technological change as one could ever want: one now-regulated industry (the auto manufacturers), two sets of federal laws ""with teeth"" (the Highway Safety Act of 1970 and the Clear Air Act of 1970), and two new federal agencies (NHTSA and EPA) to oversee the new regulations. Although automotive safety and emission-control technologies began at the same time, the same carmakers were involved and the federal government was the principal regulator, the paths in safety and emission control quickly diverged. Their technological outcomes differed dramatically. Surprisingly, although historians, sociologists, political scientists, economists, and STS scholars have studied automobile safety regulation and environmental regulation of automobile emission, no scholars have rigorously and systematically compared and contrasted these parallel developments, the processes of innovation that occurred, the new technologies they bred, and the different outcomes in automobile safety and emissions after a quarter century. The Intellectual Merits of this project lie in the effort to assemble data generated during and after this experiment in ""technology forcing,"" to conduct analyses of these data, and to generate a series of historical and policy studies (and eventually a book) on federal regulation, the automobile industry, and technological innovation. Drawing on existing secondary literature, carrying out research in published and archival sources, and conducting interviews with important actors, the PIs will construct a historically based study of automotive safety and emission-control technologies, patterns of innovation and learning in these technologies, and socio-political processes of technology in the period 1965 - 2000. Actor-network analysis of Science and Technology Studies provides one tool by which to understand the dynamics of regulation and institutional and technological innovation that led to ""safer"" and ""more environmentally-friendly"" cars. The PIs will also employ the tools of the historian of science and technology, the economist of industrial and technical change, and the environmental and mechanical engineer. Although technology-forcing regulation is known to have succeeded in driving technological innovation in several instances, considerable debate remains about the efficiencies of this approach versus market-based instruments. Cost and availability of technology are primary sources of uncertainty in adopting technology-forcing regulations. Risks involved include forcing the development to technologies that are too costly or fail to meet objectives. Technology-forcing regulation has been and will continue to be a critical challenge. This is true for the auto industry in the face of climate change regulation and safety issues, and in other industries. In terms of Broader Impacts, this contextualized analysis of the interaction between technology-forcing regulation, R&D, and institutional and technological innovation that have led to ""safer"" and ""more environmentally-friendly"" cars will improve understanding of how and when these regulations work. Government regulators and regulated firms and industries will gain a better understanding of the dynamics of technology forcing and will, it is hoped, learn from that understanding."

Most of the people who live in these regions of the world herd domestic livestock and some do limited cultivation so they are dependent directly on the environment for their livelihoods. But change is rapidly changing the environments upon which these people depend through such factors as population pressures, land use and land tenure changes, climate variability, and policy changes that affect their ability to earn a living. This project is about understanding uncertainty and change in this linked human-environment system. <br/><br/>Through the development of agent-based modeling efforts linked to ecological models we will investigate the societal factors that enable households in these systems to make land use decisions so they can be resilient to uncertainty.  Decisions that people make are expressed in land use and we will look at the effects of those decisions on ecosystem services. In other words, what is the ability of people to cope with change so that the social system and the ecological system can still provide for people and the animals that inhabit these systems? Thus it is important that we link a household model to ecological models. With work we have done in Mongolia, the northern U.S. Great Plains and in East Africa we will investigate the human-ecological effects in the face of change. <br/><br/>Research that focuses on household and community behavior is important because it is at that level where fundamental decisions are made regarding events and changes and it is here where resilience is manifested. In the future we are going to have to be much smarter in the way that we match potential ""clients"" with potential policy or technical interventions. The only way to confer resilience (on social and ecological systems) is through much better targeting ability, a large part of which is intimately entwined with understanding how households make decisions."

Research over the past decade has shown that spatial heterogeneity can influence coevolutionary interactions. However, a complete, mechanistic understanding of the influence of spatial heterogeneity on coevolution is still needed. <br/>The proposed research combines theoretical and empirical approaches to rigorously evaluate how spatial heterogeneity in resource availability and dispersal among habitat patches influence coevolution. It utilizes the bacterium Escherichia coli and the bacteriophage T7, a viral parasitoid of E. coli, as model coevolving organisms. Experiments in which dispersal and resource availability are directly manipulated will be combined with theoretical models that incorporate details of the host-parasitoid interaction to provide both qualitative and quantitative predictions of how dispersal across a heterogeneous landscape influences coevolution. This research provides a crucial middle ground between the relative simplicity of current mathematical models and the complexity of field studies. This research will add to our understanding of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution and metacommunity theory, which underlie much of the work on habitat fragmentation in conservation biology. This work will also increase our understanding of coevolving microbes, which perform many crucial ecosystem services and which have been vastly understudied. Finally, the research will contribute to our general knowledge of how spatial heterogeneity influences the ecology and evolution of interacting organisms."

More recently strains of 6% and 9.6% have been observed at room temperature in off-stoichiometry, martensitic compositions having tetragonal 5-M structure and orthorhombic 7-M structures, respectively. The mechanism for these large field-induced strains is believed to be twin boundary motion driven by magnetic energy differences and torques across the twin boundaries for certain applied field directions. While phenomenological theories exist that account for the general field dependence of the strain and magnetization, the microscopic mechanisms driving the twin boundary motion are not yet well understood. It is also not clear whether, and if so, how, the chemical order in stoichiometric compositions and chemical order in off-stoichiometric compositions affects the nucleation or kinetics of the partial dislocations, which control twin-boundary motion. This grant supports a multi-faceted experimental and modeling approach to address these issues. Neutron scattering is carried out at NIST (or Los Alamos) to determine the statistical site disorder in typical 5-M and 7-M compositions. These compositions always have excess Mn and deficiencies in Ga with Ni generally ranging from 48 to 51%. This determines where the excess Mn atoms prefer to reside, on Ni or Ga sites. An attempt will be made to identify species that accumulate at twin boundaries and that may account for the observed magnetic field or stress-induced creep observed in these materials. The effects of excess Mn occupation of Ni or Ga sites on saturation magnetization and magnetic anisotropy are studied with differential magnetometry. The Mn atoms in this intermetallic Heusler composition carry the majority of the magnetic moment. Thus, it is expected that whether Mn atoms occupy Ni or Ga sites, they will be closer to other Mn atoms and hence there could be a magnetic moment decrease. The reduced site symmetry in the partially disordered compositions may also lead to a reduction in the magnetic anisotropy, which is critical to field induced twin boundary motion. The application of a small acoustic signal to a Ni-Mn-Ga crystal, directed to induce a shear motion parallel to the twin planes has a significant enhancing effect on magnetic-field-induced twin boundary motion. These changes are investigated with changing stoichiometry. The experimental results are interpreted in terms of evolving microscopic models of partial-dislocation-mediated twin-boundary motion. NONTECHNICAL: This research is expected to have broad impact on the understanding and potential applications of Ni-Mn-Ga and other FSMA, active materials. Further, the education and outreach impact of the research will extend well beyond the training of graduate students. We make significant use of undergraduate students in our research and have extensive worldwide (China, Finland, Ukraine, Spain) and US (UCSD, ASU, Iowa State, UMd) collaborators; many of them will be involved in parts of the proposed work. Finally, our group has been honored with numerous invitations to speak at international conferences on the results of our work in this field (Dresden, Singapore, Cancun, Cardiff, and numerous locations in the US). This provides valuable opportunities for wider dissemination of our results."

Recent dramatic decreases in the numbers of many species in this region have perplexed biologists, caused sweeping and underinformed management decisions, and provoked cultural disintegration of many Alaska Native villages. Date gathered during the 20th century show that there have been other periods of low productivity for species, often followed by periods of abundance. These patterns also are evident in paleoecological and archaeological data from the last 5,000 years, thereby emphasizing the critical character of a central question: Given varying population cycles of humans, salmon, groundfish, sea mammals, birds, and many other species in the North Pacific region as well as varying harvests by the higher trophic levels, how do people sustain populations, ecosystems, and the peoples and cultures who depend on them for social, political, economic, and cultural identity? To investigate the complex interactions among natural and human systems on and around Sanak Island in the Aleutian chain of Alaska, an interdisciplinary research team will study humans as part of the northern ecosystem. The investigators will examine interrelationships among the modern and prehistoric, terrestrial and marine, and local and regional systems, including both empirical and theoretical explorations. In previous projects, the investigators have observed that the indigenous Aleut were not just simple and passive harvesters but were active participants in a regional ecosystem that includes them as significant forces. The implications of this approach require the integration of anthropology, archaeology, geology, ecology, mathematics, climatology, and history, the perspective of many spatial and temporal scales, and the seamless merging of theoretical approaches from many fields. Because the Aleut have been harvesting resources on the north Pacific for thousands of years, they have been included in models and reconstructions of the island's ecosystem as ecosystem engineers, as more ordinary components of food webs and landscapes, and as passive responders to a world that is primarily driven by largely external forces like climate and geomorphic evolution.<br/><br/>This project will result in development and application of modern analytical techniques drawn from the study of complex systems in order to better understand the roles of peoples in the history and functioning of the Earth. The investigators are constructing and analyzing the first extensive food webs that extend over millennial time scales. The project is distinctive because of its extensive explicit inclusion of people as components of food webs. The investigators are pioneering the development of techniques for extracting information from data in which error is necessarily confounded with time period, and the project will yield data that can be compared across times. The investigators are extensively developing and testing methods for interfacing data from diverse sources that inherently differ in resolution and data structure (e.g., ancient middens, climate reconstruction by proxy and modeling, various direct censuses), and they are expanding the application of stable isotopes to study ecological and paleoecological phenomena that emphasize large-scale ecosystem structure and function. The investigators also will bring new perspectives to the relationships of diversity and productivity of ecosystems, comparing systems across very long time scales , and they will advance understanding of sustainable patterns of food web and ecosystem structures and dynamics. The project will incorporate indigenous knowledge, local history, and direct community participation in data collection, and it will give residents a voice in the process of scientific advisement through both collaboration and through the analysis of marine policy that directly affects their daily lives. The project will provide critical scientific data to inform policy regarding long-term data on the role of humans in the dynamics of North Pacific ecosystems, and it will illuminate the state of historical shifting baselines in the ecosystem over deep time. The investigators are exploring a new way of doing scientific research in this kind of setting by incorporating local people as part of a complex ecosystem rather than an external impact to be externally regulated. This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems."

Because cnidarians diverged from the rest of the animals prior to the evolution of organs, their overall anatomy is quite simple. Despite this however, cnidarians have attained incredible diversity, comprising over 11,000 species, many of which display elaborate structures and complex life histories. The lack of organs and other anatomical landmarks has made it difficult for scientists to discern their evolutionary relationships. Recent technological and theoretical advances in the sequencing and analysis of DNA provide the opportunity to use the information encoded within an organism's genetic code to elucidate evolutionary relationships. The primary aim of this proposal is to obtain DNA sequence data from 1,800 cnidarian species: this will generate approximately 23 million base pairs of cnidarian DNA sequence, and the specimens from which the sequences are obtained will be retained in natural history museum collections. The information encoded in the DNA will be used to reconstruct cnidarian phylogenies (evolutionary trees), using computer algorithms and supercomputing facilities. Some of the questions this proposal will address are: Was the ancestor to all of cnidarians solitary or colonial? Are jellyfish or hydras more closely related to the corals? How and when did coral skeletons evolve? What are the evolutionary transitions between a simple hydra polyp and a complex Portuguese Man-of-War colony? Reconstructing a cnidarian evolutionary tree is important for our understanding of the patterns and processes that accompanied the early diversification of animal life. <br/><br/><br/><br/> Formal and informal education will result from this research. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars, including those belonging to groups under-represented in the sciences, will be trained. A symposium on cnidarian evolutionary relationships will be organized by the investigators at a national scientific meeting. A Cnidaria Tree of Life database will be developed to include outreach and learning components such as images, common names, and keys designed to appeal to students at all levels as well as interested users such as divers and aquarists. Museum exhibits will be created based on research results, one at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum, and one, entitled ""Cnidarian Diversity in the Oceans"" that will be part of the new Oceans Hall, due to open at the National Museum of Natural History in 2008.

The enzyme nitrogenase is composed of two separate proteins designated the Fe-protein, a homodimer coded by the nifH gene and the MoFe-protein, a heterotetramer coded by the nifDK genes. Apart from these structural genes (nifHDK), a number of nif accessory genes whose products are essential for the maturation and assembly of nitrogenase are identified. One of them is the nifM gene whose product is necessary for the production of the functional Fe-protein in Klebsiellapneumoniae and in Azotobacter vinelandii. Initial genetic analyses of nifM mutants generated by chemical mutagenesis, site-directed mutagenesis, and of a<br/>chimeric NifM:PpiC protein, indicate that the NifM protein functions as a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase). Moreover, studies on purified NifM protein also showed that this protein has PPIase activity. Based on these observations and also on the high homology shared by the PPIases and C-terminal<br/>region of the NifM, it is hypothesized that the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity of NifM is essential for this protein to exert its effect on the maturation (activity and stability) of the Fe-protein. The aim of this research is to carry out molecular and genetic analysis on the nifM gene in order to understand<br/>the functions of the nifM in nitrogen fixation. To achieve this goal, the following specific objectives will be pursued: 1) to characterize the nifM point mutants of K. pneumoniae that were previously isolated by chemical mutagenesis in order to understand the molecular basis of NifM function; 2) to identify region(s) of the A. vinelandii NifM protein that are essential for PPIase activity; 3) to identify the<br/>regions of NifM protein that are essential for interaction with the Fe-protein; and 4) to isolate and characterize nifM-independent Nif A. vinelandii mutants. These experiments are directed toward understanding how the Genetic organization of the nifM gene contributes to the role of its product in the maturation of Fe-protein. Preliminary data from mutational analysis indicate that mutations in both the N-terminal region of NifM and the C-terminal region of NifM affect the ability of NifM to participate in the maturation of the Fe-protein. These studies will help to assess the role of the C-terminal region of NifM and the PPIase activity of the NifM in the NifM ability to participate in the maturation of the Fe-protein. Moreover, these studies will help to delineate the role of the N-terminal region of the NifM in determining the NifM ability. Besides, the research projects outlined here make excellent teaching tools, utilizing many techniques in modern molecular microbiology and having easily grasped objectives. The PIs have started a series of lecture courses that deal with biotechnology and one of major goals during this grant period is to start a molecular biology laboratory course to conduct active learning, experimental learning and mentoring activities with undergraduate students at Bowling Green State University."

To create the content that will be available on the Web portal, the project team is cataloguing, organizing, and making searchable information on resources and products currently available as well as information gathered from existing email listservs on the blind in STEM subjects. The Web portal is also providing areas for teachers, parents, and students to communicate non-visual techniques and experiences, an area for interviews of blind and visually impaired individuals who are successful in STEM studies and/or careers, and opportunities for students who are blind or visually impaired to interact with and shadow blind and visually impaired individuals who are successful in STEM studies and/or careers. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>According to a cross section of experts working with students who are blind and in STEM fields, innovative solutions to improving the participation of students who are blind or who have low vision are limited by a lack of coordinated activities and resources (Advisory Committee Meetings of the National Center for Blind Youth in Science, 2004). This project will bring all existing resources into a centralized clearinghouse in order to streamline the development of new related projects and to integrate existing materials into classroom instruction. The successful development and implementation of the clearinghouse model presents the best opportunity for sparking innovation and increasing the participation of individuals who are blind, or who have low vision, in STEM fields.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>By providing an all-inclusive STEM resource relating to students who are blind, or who have visual impairments, barriers will be eroded leading to increased participation and pursuit of STEM studies and careers by students who are blind or who have visual impairments. The sharing of knowledge among teachers, parents, and students will cut down on the amount of duplication of effort that now takes place by teachers, parents, and students trying to find accessible means to study STEM subjects."

A strategic account is used to explain when courts defer or not to governments and how governments react to these decisions. The project tests the separation of powers game modeled largely on the basis of the American case in two Westminster parliamentary systems that lack the multiple veto points that hinder political action against American courts. Fewer veto points in Australia and Canada also mean the courts have more complete information about government policy preferences. The project empirically determines the dynamics of judicial-parliamentary interactions over 25-30 year periods in Australia and Canada, through the collection of case-level data for roughly 5500 decisions made by the federal courts of appeals and high courts where the national governments are direct parties in administrative law litigation. Equally important, the project collects archival data on parliamentary reactions to these decisions. The project's longitudinal dimension encourages a neo-institutionalist perspective, while its comparative dimension escapes the limits of case studies of single systems; the quantitative approach permits tests of hypotheses not possible with qualitative data. In addition, the project will provide professional training required for future academic research, and will be used to prepare computer-based ""research modules"" for undergraduate students for a course taught by the PI. Project findings and results will be submitted to Australian, Canadian, and American peer-reviewed journals after presentation at major political science conferences in these countries. A book-length manuscript based on the project will be submitted to a university press for publication."

Understanding the importance of species' interactions and their impact on communities is thus a central goal of ecologists and conservation biologists, and is the central aim of this work. The overarching goal is to examine the interactions between termites and large vertebrates in supporting the biological diversity of East African savannas, and to understand how these groups affect the distribution, diversity and abundance of other species. Such an understanding is of paramount importance as these habitats are lost, fragmented, and modified through agricultural use. Termites have been identified as key species, crucial to the functioning of entire ecosystems. In East Africa, termite mounds are a common feature of the landscape. Through their mound building activities, termites enhance soil nutrients and thus may be affect the diversity of the plants and insects that live in close proximity to these mounds. Vertebrates have also been implicated as playing a large role in the ecology of savanna habitats. However, the interactions between termites and herbivores and their effects on communities have rarely been examined. This work will provide novel data on the interactions between termites and vertebrates in providing habitat and resources that structure plant and animal communities across much of East Africa. These data are critical to understanding the forces that generate and maintain habitat heterogeneity and species diversity and to managing savanna ecosystems.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will support one full-time Post-doctoral Researcher, one part-time Post-doctoral Researcher, two graduate students (one in Kenya, one in the U.S.), three full-time technicians (two in Kenya, one in the US), and two part-time field assistants each year. The project will also be used for teaching at least 20 students per year through UC Santa Barbara's Kenya Wildlands Program. Yearly meetings will be held with the Laikipia Wildlife Forum, which includes scientists, local ranch managers and traditional Maasai pastoralists, to discuss the results of the project. The results will be disseminated to scientists in Kenya at the International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology, the National Museums of Kenya and the University of Nairobi. The project represents a significant contribution to human resource development, bridge-building among scientific institutions and among the scientific and lay communities of East Africa, and education in a geographical region where such opportunities are rare."

Children who experience problems in academic areas also tend to have difficulty in social and emotional competence. A scientific agenda for understanding how academic achievement and social emotional competence are related would have wide ranging implications for education and public health, both direct and indirect. This two day symposium brings together scholars from across multiple disciplines to forge a synthesis of two bodies of knowledge that have remained separate despite their links with successful schooling. <br/><br/>The array of variables related to academic achievement (attention, emotion, motivation, interest) and social emotional competence (attention, interest, self-regulation, emotion understanding) is studied differently in various disciplines.

The CARIACO site is situated in the tropics on a productive continental margin off Venezuela, the basin is anoxic, and the site is strongly connected to paleoclimate investigations. Thus, CARIACO has the additional goal of relating modern oceanographic processes with the production, transformation, and preservation of particulate matter in the sediment record. <br/><br/>Zooplankton composition, behavior, and physiological rates are important components of the biological pump. Recent findings from the Cariaco Basin and other regions with pelagic redoxclines (suboxic and anoxic interfaces) suggest that they are active regions of biogeochemical cycling, in which C may be directly transferred from bacterial production to zooplankton grazers. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to determine the vertical and horizontal distributions of zooplankton in relation to the redoxcline during two seasons using discrete-depth net samples and a vertical-profiling laser-line scan camera system. Anaerobic and aerobic respiration and metabolites, excretion, and egestion rates will be experimentally determined for vertical migrators and resident species nearsurface and at suboxic and anoxic depths to determine whether zooplankton differ in their release of metabolic and egested products, due to differences in their metabolism and/or composition of food resources. Grazing experiments, in combination with lipid biomarkers and stable isotopic compositions, will be used to assess in situ diet and long-term feeding history of zooplankton. Fecal pellet composition will be compared with pellets in sediment traps. Time-series zooplankton samples also will be analyzed to obtain temporal information on zooplankton community dynamics and allow a seasonal estimate of the zooplankton contribution to elemental fluxes. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. One of the grand challenges of oceanography is to understand the processes that control the transformation and fate of organic carbon in marine systems. Meeting this challenge is hindered by a lack of basic information about factors that govern the response of biological activity to environmental forcing and climate change. In particular, the role of the marine biosphere in the global carbon cycle remains poorly constrained, in part due to uncertainties about biological controls on the quality and quantity of carbon export. This project will contribute to our knowledge of the role of mesozooplankton in biogeochemical cycles, especially in relation to how processes may be modified in regions with anoxic or suboxic layers and strong redox gradients, and will help to correctly understand the links between water column processes and climate history as recorded in the varved sediments of the Cariaco Basin. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The zooplankton time-series will provide information on patterns of marine biodiversity and ecological interactions from a poorly known region. The CARIACO Program has an ongoing impact in technology transfer and human resource development in Venezuela. This project will help train personnel in Venezuela and will support several graduate students. The lead investigators and students will develop materials on the project for dissemination through the NSF-Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence (COSEE) located at USF."

Berg, Peter (UVA) Proposal #: 0536431<br/><br/>PROJECT TITLE: Further development of the Eddy Correlation Technique<br/><br/>Project Summary<br/>Sediment-water exchange of O2 is a key parameter in biogeochemical studies of marine systems. The first phase of this project will improve the ability to measure O2 through further development of the eddy correlation technique. This development will enhance both the accessibility of the technique to users in general and the potential for long-term deployment of the eddy correlation technique in observatory systems like ORION and NEON. In the second phase, the technique will be used to study the complex dynamic nature of transport, consumption, and production of O2 at the sediment-water interface. This technique is superior to traditional methods for many applications in marine systems as there is no disturbance of the sediment, it is conducted under natural hydrodynamic and light conditions, and it can be used specifically for highly permeable or vegetated sediments where traditional methods fail. The strong interest in this technique is currently hindered as the technique demands custom-made components and specialized programming of both sampling scheme and flux extraction algorithms. This project will develop the eddy correlation technology to a stage where the instrument can be built with off-the-shelf components. Furthermore, it includes production of user-friendly software for extracting fluxes from measured data and estimation of other key parameters such as the size of the sediment surface area that contributes to the O2 flux and turbulent properties related to the O2 transport in the benthic boundary layer. The Clark-type O2 sensor used in eddy correlation measurements today is inherently fragile and prohibits the use of the technique in observatory systems such as ORION and NEON. For that reason, a more robust optical O2 sensor will be tested. Study sites will include fine-grained cohesive and sandy permeable sediments"

This system will be superior to most near coastal ocean models, which are typically wind driven but not contamination transport driven, in that our new model will be both.

The project will create research topics in multiscale mathematics, statistics, and software application integration with a flexible, Grid-based<br/>database and problem solving environment. The project will follow an integrated approach that addresses technical issues at each step of the process: 1) the dynamic simulation instructs the sensors what to look for and reprograms it for those analytes, 2) the sensors report to the simulation the new observed data, and 3) the simulation then incorporates the new data, updates its predictions, and reprograms the sensors as necessary in a closed loop. We will reduce the amount of human intervention needed to monitor spills and other contamination events, making DDDAS viable for sensors going to locations that are difficult to communicate with the sensors in real-time (e.g., an unreliable satellite link or another planetary body in the future). The work will build on the successful results of research previously funded by the NSF, including the SURA Coastal Ocean Observation and Prediction and two ITR projects to develop algorithms, error controls, and<br/>middleware to optimally manage provably scalable computing resources for Grid computing. The project has the ultimate objective to guide the development of hardware and software to enable performing both lab and ocean test, but these tasks will be relegated for follow-on efforts to the present project.

Total replacement value of the lines alone (excluding land) is conservatively estimated at over $100 billion dollars [1] and triples when including transformers and circuit breakers. Investment in new transmission equipment has significantly declined over the past 15 years. Maintaining acceptable electric transmission system reliability and delivering electric energy at low energy prices requires innovations in sensing, diagnostics, communications, data management, processing, algorithms, risk-assessment, decision-making (for operations, maintenance, and planning), and process coordination. Among these asset management problems, the data-driven electric power industry has made strides in sensing and diagnostics. Yet there has been less progress in communications, data management, information processing and associated algorithms, risk assessment methods, and decision-making paradigms, and progress has been almost nonexistent in process coordination; it is precisely in these areas that we propose our work. The objective of this project is to develop a hardware-software prototype capable of auto-steering the information-decision cycles inherent to managing operations, maintenance, and planning of the high-voltage electric power transmission systems. In pursuing this objective, we will implement and advance creative approaches to 5 main problems inherent to management of capital-intensive, geographically distributed physical assets: (a) Sensing and communications; (b) Integrating data;<br/>(c) Transforming condition measurements to reliability metrics; (d) Developing and linking multi-time scale stochastic decision algorithms; (e) Valuation of information and subsequent sensor deployment. The project will also build a prototype auto-steered information-decision process on top of a novel simulation environment representing the Iowa power system that is driven by, and drives, field installations. The immediate impact will be an increased ability and confidence therein to handle and use the massive data streams associated with owning and operating transmission equipment, resulting in better investment, maintenance, and operating decisions, and ultimately, more economic and more reliable electric delivery of electric power."

The impact of this convective response upon the ensuing evolution of an externally forced tropical cyclone will also be examined. In the particular case of a vertically sheared tropical cyclone, convection has been argued to have both positive and negative influences on vortex structure and intensity. This study will attempt to define the role of convection by examining the impact of vertical shear on a moist-convective vortex within a simplified wave-mean dynamical framework. <br/><br/>The research employs a combined observational and numerical modeling approach. The observations include airborne dual-Doppler radar measurements within a rapidly intensifying, yet vertically-sheared, hurricane. A unique three-dimensional documentation of the hurricane structure and evolution, including the eyewall interface and upper-tropospheric vortex circulation, will be used to examine the nature, timing, and location of convection within the vortex core. These observations will be used to represent convection in a series of idealized numerical simulations. The idealized simulations are designed to elucidate the role of convection in tropical cyclone resiliency and to determine how and when convection begins to impact the tropical cyclone negatively. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The research will provide new insights into i) the observed three-dimensional mixing between eye and eyewall within a rapidly intensifying hurricane, ii) the observed convective asymmetry within a vertically-sheared hurricane, iii) the role of convection in vertically-sheared hurricane resiliency, and iv) the role of deep cumulus convection in the weakening of a vertically-sheared hurricane.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research activities will have several broader impacts. Regarding hurricanes: Presently, there exists a single observational study of the three-dimensional hurricane vorticity dynamics. The case study to be undertaken will be an important step towards increasing the statistical database of three-dimensional observations, which is crucial if such data are to be meaningfully assimilated into mesoscale numerical forecast models. Additionally, the mapping of effective stratification based on observed data within the hurricane core may be used by future investigators for idealized numerical modeling. More generally: The convection-vortex interaction is a general atmospheric problem (e.g., mid-latitude MCVs) and has parallels with the convectively-coupled equatorial wave problem. This study will draw upon this broader knowledge base, and in return will contribute beyond the scope of hurricanes. Two graduate students and an undergraduate will be trained in the techniques of radar data editing and analysis, atmospheric dynamics, and numerical modeling. These students will also be encouraged to interact with scientists at NOAA's Hurricane Research Division through their ongoing cooperation with the universities."

The proposed<br/>research will expand upon promising preliminary work using Ca isotope ratios as paleoecological<br/>indicators and develop this isotopic system as a proxy for the trophic level of extinct marine mammals.<br/>By combining Ca isotope analyses with C isotope ratios, which vary with foraging habitat in marine<br/>ecosystems, this project will provide a new means to examine the structure of ancient marine vertebrate<br/>ecosystems. Since the trophic structure of foodwebs has a significant influence on the pathways by which<br/>nutrients and energy move within and between ecosystems, analysis of the Ca isotope composition of<br/>biogenic hard parts may aid in elucidating how nutrient cycling and energy flow have fluctuated over<br/>time. Furthermore, by expanding current knowledge of how ancient ecosystems functioned and how they<br/>differed from today s ecosystems, a44Ca measurements can help improve interpretations of how climatic<br/>and environmental perturbations have impacted or were impacted by the Earth s biosphere. Ultimately,<br/>this project will provide new insight into the evolution of whales, whose from a terrestrial ancestor<br/>represents one of the most remarkable transitions in the history of life on Earth.<br/>Although the ultimate objective of this research is to understand the role of temporal changes in<br/>foraging behavior in the evolution of Cetacea (the clade that includes living whales, porpoises, and<br/>dolphins), the influence on Ca isotope ratios of factors other than trophic level must be examined first in<br/>modern species before Ca isotope ratios can be applied to extinct species. Samples of marine mammals in<br/>four, distantly related groups (sirenians, mustellids, cetaceans, and pinnipeds) will be analyzed as a means<br/>of addressing the impact of phylogenetic history on a44Ca values; the degree of similarity of a44Ca values<br/>for species at the same trophic level will verify whether a44Ca values reflect trophic level differences<br/>regardless of evolutionary history. The C isotope composition of each sample will be analyzed as a proxy<br/>for foraging habitat preference; a stronger correlation between a44Ca with trophic level rather than a13C<br/>values will indicate that trophic level has a stronger influence on a44Ca values than the foraging habits of<br/>a species. Variation in a44Ca within a single individual will be explored by analyzing the Ca isotope<br/>composition of multiple skeletal elements from a single individual from each of the four modern groups<br/>of marine mammals sampled. Once the factors influencing a44Ca values in modern marine mammals<br/>have been constrained, the Ca and C isotope composition of Eocene and Oligocene cetacean and sirenian<br/>bioapatite will be analyzed to assess the potential of this proxy for paleoecological studies. The<br/>diversification of cetacean feeding strategies in the Oligocene should coincide with a large change in<br/>a44Ca and a13C values of cetacean bioapatite, providing a clear signal of whether original a44Ca values can<br/>be preserved and interpreted from the fossil record. Fossil bones of sirenians will also be analyzed as a<br/>control for potential changes in seawater a44Ca values, since the trophic level of this group has remained<br/>constant over time and any changes in the a44Ca values of this group will reflect changes in seawater<br/>a44Ca values.<br/>Broader impacts. The broader impacts of this project are threefold. First, the grant will further<br/>the training and development of a recent Ph.D. who will be supported as a postdoc. Under the<br/>supervision of the PIs, this researcher will have primary responsibility for refining the methodologies,<br/>acquiring and analyzing the samples, and interpreting and disseminating the results. Second, the research<br/>will provide a new and potentially powerful paleoecological tool to the broader community that can be<br/>applied to other ancient marine ecosystems and, after further development, may also have applications in<br/>terrestrial ecosystems. Finally, the results will complement our increasingly detailed knowledge of whale<br/>evolution. Once the proposed research is completed, the ecological and morphological changes<br/>associated with the evolution of whales will be one of the best documented cases of macroevolutionary<br/>change in the vertebrate fossil record. Given the historical place of whale origins in anti-evolution<br/>polemics, this research will surely have lasting impact in undergraduate and K-12 class rooms."

This fills a need for strengthened ethics education in the natural sciences. Ethics education in the natural and social sciences has been much less systematic than in medicine, business, and engineering. Further, ethics education in the natural sciences is often limited to instruction on the responsible conduct of research (RCR). This topic is typically handled in a single class meeting or an on-line training module, and is seldom accompanied by training in ethical sensitivity or ethical decision-making skills. <br/><br/>Graduate students are typically inculcated in research methods to view their research as objective and value-free. Research in the environmental sciences, however, often influences society and the environment in profound ways, and the conduct and interpretation of this research is rich in ethical assumptions and issues. Minimal training in the RCR is not adequate in educating graduate students about the full ethical dimensions of their research. We are investigating the hypothesis that expanded ethics education that encompasses ethical issues inherent in the content of scientific research as well as attention to the ethical conduct of scientific research will both improve students' appreciation of traditional RCR training and enrich students' understanding of the ethical context of their research in the environmental sciences. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project is seeking major advances in both the content and pedagogy of ethics education by developing and assessing the impact of curricular modules on topics in the environmental sciences. The research component of the project will test two hypotheses. The first is that increased emphasis in graduate education on ethical frameworks and ethical reasoning skills is correlated with a better understanding of and/or attitudes toward RCR. The second hypothesis is that extending ethics education beyond RCR is correlated with a better understanding of and/or attitudes toward ethics education in the sciences. Our modules will provide future scientists with an appreciation of the range of ethical issues they will face and the skills needed to address them. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: While most scientists are committed to ensuring that their students appreciate the importance of scientific integrity, this topic is one many scientists feel under-prepared to teach. Tested, off-the-shelf modules that provide curricular support are thus a welcome addition to many instructors engaged in graduate education. This project is assessing how much ethics education is sufficient relative to identified learning objectives, enabling faculty to judge how best to incorporate the modules. The pedagogical techniques and assessment strategies that are being developed in the first year of this study will be implemented in graduate courses at Carnegie Mellon, Penn State Harrisburg, and at Slippery Rock University in subsequent years. Our results are being widely disseminated both by creating pedagogical modules and case study analyses for electronic publishing on the web pages of the Rock Ethics Institute, and through journal publications."

A small number of these individuals are eligible for resettlement in the USA, but little is known about the health and well being of these individuals once they are resettled into developed countries. Theorists hypothesize that while freed from the violence and war that characterize refugee situations, refugees will face poverty and concomitant shifts in dietary practice and health seeking behavior, which may negatively affect health. This study will focus on one particularly important aspect of public health: food insecurity. Food insecurity is a good indicator of poor dietary practice and is associated with a range of health outcomes including excess body weight. The aim is to quantify the magnitude of food insecurity in two refugee communities, examine the cultural, social, and economic correlates of food insecurity (and its sequelae), and assess the validity of current food insecurity measurement tools. The project utilizes a two site, two ethnic group longitudinal study design. Methods of data collection include focus groups, participant observation, a survey, and anthropometric measures of weight and height. It will be the largest longitudinal study to date of these populations, and one of the few measuring the health impact of resettlement among African refugees living in the USA. Such data is imperative to addressing concerns about the costs and burdens of hosting refugees.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>Concern over the well-being of refugees and the costs of hosting refugees are widespread, and there is growing interest in the social determinants of health and well-being. This project will add significantly to our understanding in each of these areas. The project will help fill a huge gap in knowledge about public health nutrition among resettled refugees, as it aims to not only identify who is most at risk of food insecurity but why, and in doing so would offer useful programmatic insights. This information will be particularly important for designing interventions and health-education programs. The research would also address the pressing issue of how to best measure food insecurity among newly arrived refugees. Ensuring that a food security scale is a valid indicator of deprivation is of enormous importance for monitoring and advocacy and for identifying determinants of food insecurity. Several refugees will also be hired as interviewers. The results that come from the project will be distributed to both professional groups that represent refugees and to resettlement agencies; the information can be used by these groups for advocacy and to monitor trends in several health outcomes."

Among the most important changes and those best reflected in the fossil record involved the shape of the head, related to language, diet, defense, threat, olfaction, intelligence, vision, and posture. These include shortening the face and tucking it under the braincase, smaller teeth (especially canines), increased brain size, and reorientation of the cranial base. Our knowledge of the evolution of these traits will remain limited until we understand their underlying biological, and in particular, genetic bases. <br/>The purpose of this pilot project is to identify genetic factors underlying the nature and timing of changes in skull shape during the evolution of humans, apes, and Old World monkeys. A combined strategy will: (1) identify the dimensions of natural craniofacial development, variation and evolution from living and fossil primate skulls, (2) identify genes that in baboons and mice are associated with variation in those dimensions, and (3) experimentally confirm that these genes are appropriately expressed during craniofacial developmental networks that may be responsible for evolution of craniofacial shape within and between species. <br/>3D reconstructions of a set of computed X-ray tomography (CT) scans acquired from a set of fossil African papionin skulls will be analyzed quantitatively to identify single and multivariate axes of craniofacial variation. These results will be coupled with observations from the literature to identify features of craniofacial variation that were important in the evolution of these animals. Similar CT scans will be obtained from approximately 250 baboon skulls in a large, known genealogy at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research (SFBR), that have been genotyped for about 350 microsatellite markers across the genome. Linkage mapping will be done to identify chromosomal regions in the baboons that affect these axes of variation. Mice and primates share the basic processes of skeletal development, so the mouse is a phenotypic and genetic model for identifying these processes, and two gene mapping approaches will be taken to do that. Chromosomal regions identified by mapping in the mouse and baboon will be tested experimentally by examining gene expression and DNA sequence changes in coding or regulatory regions that affect the axes of craniofacial change that were identified from the CT scans. <br/> This is an integrated developmental evolutionary approach to understand the genetic elements of craniofacial variation. Current phylogenetic approaches use craniofacial features in the absence of knowledge of their genetic basis. One consequence is that we cannot discriminate between change due to common genetic determination and adaptive convergence and this has led to inconsistencies between molecular and morphologically based phylogenies. The identification of developmental genetic pathways will provide tests of the homology of such traits. <br/> Intellectual Merit -- The general problems and approaches to the developmental genetics of complex metric traits are of widespread interest to biologists of all types because similar problems and processes are widespread in nature.<br/> Broader Impact -- The researchers will create a major archive of 3D CT images of baboon skulls, genetic materials, and quantitative methods, and make them available to other investigators. This project involves several institutions here and abroad, and will include undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students. Post docs working in the various laboratories will travel to the Southwest Foundation to train in methods of analysis. Women and minority students are regularly trained in these labs and minority students will be actively recruited."

The tastes of monosodium glutamate (MSG), other amino acids, and sweet stimuli signal general food types and influence dietary intake. MSG, an amino acid that occurs naturally in foods such as vegetables and meats, elicits a taste called ""umami"" that increases the palatability of food and, thus, food intake. Unlike other primary tastes, sweet, sour, salty, and bitter, the biological mechanisms for detecting umami are not well understood. Although MSG has a prototypical umami quality, it has multiple perceptual qualities, possibly by stimulation of several taste receptors. Behavioral studies have shown that MSG also elicits taste qualities similar to sweet stimuli when the sodium taste is minimized. MSG is detected in part by a glutamate receptor called ""taste-mGluR4"". In rats, behavioral studies show that MSG and L-AP4 (an mGluR4 agonist) have nearly identical tastes. Nerve fiber recordings reveal that some fibers respond synergistically to mixtures of L-AP4 and sweet stimuli but, curiously, only fibers that respond weakly to sucrose alone. These same fibers do not show synergy to mixtures of MSG and sweet stimuli, suggesting that L-AP4 evokes a sweet taste through mGluR4 receptors. Molecular studies report that another potential umami receptor, T1R1/T1R3, responds broadly to L-amino acids, including MSG, but not to sweet stimuli. Together, these data suggest that there are multiple taste receptors for MSG and at least some L-amino acids but critical behavioral data are lacking. <br/>Using rats, Dr. Delay will combine pharmacological antagonism of specific receptors with behavioral methods, such as conditioned taste aversion (in which rats attend to perceptual similarities) and discrimination (in which rats attend to differences), to address three important questions: 1) Are taste-mGluR4 receptors involved in the sweet taste of MSG? 2) Does L-AP4 have a sweet quality and do taste-mGluR4 receptors contribute to this quality? 3) Is the taste of glutamate similar to other L-amino acids? Knowledge gained from these studies will help identify the taste receptors responsible for the perception of glutamate and amino acids. The project will provide opportunities for undergraduate students to gain knowledge and experience about research and scientific processes, and prepare for careers in science. The results may also help improve dietary intake of people who have deficiencies as a result of not eat well, e.g., elderly, chemotherapy patients, etc."

We bring together tools, techniques, and insights from cognitive psychology, anthropology, and computer science to investigate the dynamics of conceptual knowledge. Intellectual Merit. At the center of the project is an exploration of the multifaceted dynamics of conceptual knowledge about folk medicine. The primary research site is the Highlands of Chiapas, where the researchers will study within- and cross-cultural differences in conceptual knowledge among Tzotzil Maya and Ladinos. This study examines how folkmedical concepts are represented and used by novices and various experts and relate patterns of conceptual agreement to the structure of social and expert networks. Given the isolation of their community, cultural differences are expected between folkmedical concepts of Maya and Ladinos. The researchers will explore short-term dynamics of conceptual change by sponsoring a medical workshop provided by a local NGO and a Vanderbilt physician, consultants on this proposal. Long-term dynamics of conceptual change are explored by examining changes in folkmedical knowledge by expert and novice groups in Pichataro, a Purepecha community that has witnessed significant change over the thirty years since Garro's original research. Thre researchers also explore conceptual knowledge of folkmedicine for Hispanics in the Nashville area, providing a key comparison group to Pitchataro (an area where many US immigrants originate). The project aims to better understand how conceptual knowledge is represented, how it differs among experts and novices, how it is acquired from instruction, observation, and intervention, and how it changes with new experiences. Computational modeling grounds psychological mechanisms in mathematical and computational formalisms, adding rigor to our theories and allowing the complex dynamics of conceptual change to be explored in simulation. New advances in modeling investigate how conceptual knowledge can be incrementally adjusted from new experiences, how causal knowledge is integrated with rule-based and statistical knowledge, and how conceptual models and agent-based models can be integrated. Ultimately,this project will bridge multiple levels of analysis in order to develop an understanding of how cultural processes constrain individual cognition, how cognitive mechanisms contribute to cultural change, and how these mechanisms can be formally characterized in computational models.<br/>Broader Impacts. This collaboration will enhances the interdisciplinary perspective of investigators from anthropology, psychology, and computer science, influencing future research, teaching, and public outreach. It trains a new generation of scientists to combine methods, perspectives, and theoretical approaches from different fields. It fosters international ties with researchers in Mexico.While the focus is on the dynamics of conceptual knowledge, a specific understanding of conceptual knowledge about folk medicine could contribute toward educating the public - especially our growing immigrant population - about scientific medical treatments. Furthermore, the project includes Vanderbilt Medical School personnel and will help train a new generation of medical staff to deal with the challenges of attending to an increasing number of patients from different cultural settings."

It will prompt early consideration and evaluation of system-level methods for improving processor efficiency, providing important input to computer architects.<br/><br/>Thus, it may help reduce the trials and errors that would be very expensive and would delay the<br/>improvement of high performance computing systems. The proposed experiment support will benefit other<br/>researchers in both computer architecture and high-performance computing communities, and help them see<br/>the needs of each other before the real machines are available."

The effort builds on the research summarized in several NRC expert panels and the ideas which have been emerging in interdisciplinary efforts to develop a broader understanding the impact of educational testing on teaching and learning. The project will start with a multi-level model of formative assessment that emerged in two prior NSF funded studies. In an unprecedented collaboration, this approach will be refined and validated by a team of experts representing mathematics education, mathematical sciences, linguistics, educational testing, and educational assessment. The project advisory panel consists of international leaders in each area, including individuals who are also spearheading interdisciplinary advance across these areas.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>Broad impact is expected because the approach meets the demand of the NCLB act for immediate and continual gains on criterion-referenced tests for all students, without undercutting other educational goals. In addition to directly advancing elementary mathematics instruction, the project offers a scalable, worthwhile alternative to the ubiquitous ""test-prep"" interventions that often do more harm than good. The project will broaden classroom assessment to directly advance students' discourse, fluency, and understanding, and guide teachers' remediation and curricular refinement. As such the project will forge new insights for using classroom discourse and formative feedback for accomplishing these broad goals which oftentimes are treated as if they are in conflict.<br/>The approach features two levels of classroom assessments (semi-formal and formal) and an innovative ""conversational"" approach to formative feedback. Existing (commercial and public domain) assessments will be used to create 26 open-ended quizzes and 2 multiple-choice exams. The quizzes are aligned to existing curriculum, completed after appropriate regular lessons, and are ungraded. The exams consist of items that are aligned with the subdomains of the pertinent criterion referenced test, are completed at the end of the semester, and are formally graded. .Learner oriented formative feedback rubrics will be developed for both. The rubrics offer detailed, technically accurate explanations of the problems, without directly stating the ""correct"" answer. Students use their completed assessments and the rubrics to discuss their collective understanding of the assessed topics. Simple video-based coaches guide them toward worthwhile feedback conversations; materials and guidelines will help teachers (1) align assessments to their existing curriculum, (2) use initial performance and mathematical discourse to improve that curriculum, and (3) provide informal and formal remediation.<br/>The study will focus on fifth-grade mathematics, and take place in two Georgia elementary schools that serve a high proportion of ethnic and linguistic minorities. Across three year-long implementations, success is ensured by using design-based and linguistic methods to directly enhance students' mathematical discourse and teachers use of formative feedback , while indirectly maximizing students' performance on four outcome measures (an innovative discourse-based assessment, CTB's open-ended Balanced Assessment in Mathematic, Georgia's Criterion-Referenced Content Test, and the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills). The schools will be randomly assigned to implementation or comparison conditions. The first year will consist of piloting and iterative refinements with just one implementation teacher. During the second year, the three or four fifth grade teachers participating at the implementation school will be assigned to different conditions to test the individual and collective impact of the quizzes and exams. Gains on the outcome measures will be compared to similar fifth-grade classrooms at the comparison school. These results will be used to define a final version that will be implemented by all fifth-grade teachers at the implementation school. Students' performance at the implementation school will be compared to the performance of all of the fifth-graders in the comparison school on all four outcome measures."

The field of Symbolic Computation has, by its very nature, been pushed forward by the symbiotic relationship between the development of computational tools and the development and implementation of good algorithms. This relationship is reflected in the various research projects supported by this award. The research relies heavily on the ability to compute examples and test proposed algorithms, not only to see what is true but also to see which algorithms truly work. <br/><br/>Symbolic Computation is of fundamental importance throughout science and industry.

The work of the symbolic computation group at NC State University will help expand these programs to become even more powerful and at the same time improve their usability. This will enable more and more people to take advantage of these powerful mathematical tools. Good symbolic computation packages will turn theoretical models into practical software.

Half the CO2 produced by humans-mainly from the burning of fossil fuels-remains in the atmosphere. The other ""missing half"" is either adsorbed by the oceans or taken up by terrestrial plants during photosynthesis. Knowing how much goes where is a crucial link in understanding how human activity affects global climate and the global carbon cycle. A useful marker to trace the destination of CO2 is the ratio of 13C to 12C in CO2 in the air. Land plants preferentially take up 12C, enriching the air in 13C. The oceans don't discriminate when they take up CO2. So by measuring the ratio of 13C to 12C, scientists can tell whether the CO2 is going into land plants or into the ocean. But there is variation in how much 13C to 12C land plants take up, so the models that predict where human-produced CO2 winds up can have significant error. To limit the error, and develop better estimates of the fate of CO2, a new study will be conducted to examine southern pine forests, one of the largest carbon sinks in North America. The study will look at how climate variability affects the 13C/12C ratio of the CO2 that plants absorb and release during their respiration. The result may yield a significant recalculation of how important land plants are as a ""sink"" for human-produced CO2.<br/><br/>The study will look at carbon isotope composition in leaf waxes and respired CO2. This will be used to improve estimates of the distribution and magnitude of the terrestrial carbon sink, a step in further understanding the importance of land plants as absorbers of CO2 produced by humans."

One of the chairs and five of the organizing committee are from US universities. Support from NSF would be used to assist primarily the participation of graduate students, post-docs and junior faculty who would otherwise not be able to attend from the USA. The project has originated from two previous ""Applied Inverse Problem"". The first was in Italy in 2001 and the second at Lake Arrowhead, CA USA in 2003. A total attendance of 170 is expected. From the USA, the investigator estimates 15 at full professor level, 20 other faculty and 25 PhD/Postdocs. The workshop will be led by researchers from world-leading centres and will cover a number of theoretical and application areas, both established and upcoming, in a set of specialist ``minisymposia''. The impact thus touches many important disciplines in present-day science, engineering and medicine as well as advancing the boundaries of computational mathematics itself. Application for subsidy will be made available on the workshop website. Recommendations from academic supervisors will be sought and priority will be given according to need and ability. Women, minorities and people with disabilities will be given particular consideration. The requested fund will be used to support only US participants.<br/><br/>The field of inverse problems in the broadest sense is the study of theoretical and practical methods for recovering the properties of physical or mathematical structures from indirect measurements of derived quantities. In recent years the enormous increase in computing power has made it possible to apply the techniques of inverse problems to situations of growing complexity. Applications are very widespread in science, medicine and engineering and include, for example, a number of medical as well as other imaging techniques, location of oil and mineral deposits in the earth's substructure, creation of astrophysical images from telescope data, finding cracks and interfaces within materials, shape optimization, model identification in growth processes and, more recently, modeling in the life sciences. The goal of this meeting is to provide a forum for mathematicians and practitioners working in the theory and applications of such inverse problems and to bridge the gap between research into analytical aspects and their practical, mostly computational, applications. We expect to provide a timely and significant boost to the mathematical and also cross-disciplinary communities in the USA and elsewhere by bringing researchers up to the state of the art. Younger participants will be able to assess current opportunities on a global scale for the next phases of their research careers. The European location will give junior US participants an excellent opportunity to exchange ideas with their European (including Eastern European) counterparts. The investigators expect that this will result in new collaborations. In contrast to the traditional meeting pattern of senior invited speakers and contributed papers, the workshop format will allow a comprehensive view of the state of the art, the exploration of current problems and new applications and will encourage new collaborations, both national and international and between academe and industry."

For the past 3 years, the New York University Medical School has planned 25 and built and evaluated 4 disease-specific, peer-reviewed SIMMs, which are designed based on sound curriculum development and multimedia design principles as well as educational theory. The SIMMs utilize state-of-the-art multimedia to ensure novice clinicians have the opportunity to expand and practice their clinical competence skills. Yet despite enthusiastic interest from colleagues at other US medical schools, collaboration on development and distribution of the SIMMs has been virtually impossible due to differing IT infrastructures, technical capabilities, and institutional resources including and especially faculty time.<br/><br/>This project addresses the ability of a platform based on edge-side content management to meet the requirements of scalability, extensibility, and security required for effective distribution and collective development of the SIMMs, which are bandwidth intensive and utilized by a geographically diverse population. This mechanism will overcome current obstacles to effectively sharing rich media tools and enable rigorous assessment of their impact on medical students' clinical competence. Knowledge gained from this project will inform further development and implementation of such tools and guide the next wave of implementation and study in medical education.<br/><br/>In broad terms, this work addresses internationally recognized difficulties in building consistent, high-quality learning environments that guarantee clinical competence for all physicians-in-training, particularly those in underserved areas globally.

The intellectual merit and goal of this IGERT program is to provide scientists with greater understanding of the complex issues of coupled human and natural systems and a framework for interfacing policy and science to manage them. While building from a firm disciplinary base (each trainee's major), the program will overlay coursework in complementary disciplines and incorporate interdisciplinary training and research experiences. The program links four colleges, fifteen departments, and three research centers at the University of Florida with international wetlands research centers in Africa, Mexico, South America, Australia, and south Florida. A core set of interdisciplinary team taught courses is a key part of the educational experience of our trainees. In addition, trainees will spend each summer at one of the international research centers researching and exploring, first hand, Adaptive Management and the science, engineering, and policy frameworks that are necessary to drive it. The broader impacts of the program will be the education and training of scientists and engineers who can adaptively manage coupled human and natural systems, and the institutionalization at the University of Florida of a dynamic, integrative learning environment. Both outcomes will be accomplished by the involvement of faculty and administrators who are committed to the concept of team teaching and research and who are not intimidated by the prospect of graduate education as an adaptive, interdisciplinary endeavor. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries."

The project will provide a controlled test of the claim that bridging cultural differences in how one understands science will lead to improved learning of science content knowledge. The PIs' previous research with the Menominee has indicated that rural Native-American children begin school with a relatively precocious understanding of biology, but that this initial knowledge of the natural world does not translate into superior learning in traditional science curricula. On standardized tests Menominee children score above the national average in science in fourth grade, but by eighth grade it is their worst subject. The PIs explore the hypothesis that Native-American practices may clash with the cultural context and methodology used in the formal teaching of science. The proposal includes studies that will explore the educational relevance of cultural differences in approaches to the teaching of science and it includes the design, implementation, and evaluation of an after-school program. The initial studies will continue the researchers efforts to identify barriers to Native-American science learning and to develop and test strategies for building on the cultural knowledge that Native-American children bring to the classroom. Research on children's folkbiology has been conducted almost exclusively with individuals from urban North American populations. The proposed research will bring more evidence to bear on the problem of science learning in minority culture contexts."
0524334	Collaborative Research: Regulation of Cell Expansion and Microtubule Function by SPR1	MCB	Cellular Dynamics and Function	09/01/2005	08/21/2010	David Ehrhardt	DC	Carnegie Institution of Washington	Standard Grant	Richard Rodewald	02/28/2011	"$296,022.00"		ehrhardt@stanford.edu	1530 P ST NW	WASHINGTON	DC	200051910	2023876400	BIO	1114	"1132, 9109, 9183, BIOT, 1114"	$0.00	"Scientific merit: <br/>Microtubules play a central role in many aspects of plant growth and development including cell expansion, division and signaling. In plants, microtubules become organized into four distinct arrays with varying functions. It has recently been shown that microtubules in the cortical array become repositioned by a treadmilling motility mechanism that is driven by frequent cycles of microtubule plus end growth, pausing, and shortening (termed dynamic instability), and intermittent episodes of minus end depolymerization. An elucidation of microtubule end behavior is essential for understanding important aspects of microtubule organization and function. In animals and fungi, dynamic instability is regulated by a collection of proteins called +TIPS (plus end tracking proteins) that are preferentially localized to microtubule plus ends, where they also participate in capturing and moving cellular components. Little is known about what +TIPS exist in plants, let alone how they regulate dynamic instability and affect microtubule function. The Principal Investigators have recently identified a novel plant specific +TIP named SPIRAL1 (SPR1) in a forward genetics screen looking for Arabidopsis mutants affected in root cell expansion. The organs of spr1 mutants exhibit both touch induced and constitutive directional cell expansion defects that are enhanced by lower temperatures and suppressed by anti-microtubule drugs. Sequence analyses show that the 12 kD SPR1 protein has five homologues in Arabidopsis, with these proteins having highly conserved direct repeat sequences at their amino and carboxy termini, separated by a region of low complexity that is predicted to form a rod-like structure. Given that a stably expressed SPR1:GFP fusion protein behaves like other GFP labeled +TIPS in that it preferentially localizes to growing microtubule plus ends and disperses upon microtubule shortening, the Principal Investigators predict that like those other +TIPS, SPR1 regulates microtubule dynamic instability, recruits proteins to microtubule plus ends, and/or links microtubules to other cellular structures. To test these hypotheses, important parameters of dynamic microtubule behavior will be analyzed in the spr1-6 null allele as well as in SPR1 over-expressing plants, using time-lapse confocal microscopy and fluorescent microtubule markers. It will be determined if SPR1 binds directly to microtubules by performing in vitro microtubule pull-down assays. A yeast two-hybrid system will be used to screen libraries for SPR1 interacting proteins and to test candidate MAPs for SPR1 interactions. Particular focus will be placed on identifying the relationship between SPR1 and Arabidopsis homologues to the well-characterized animal EB1-like proteins, given that animal EB1 proteins have many binding partners and the Arabidopsis AtEB1 proteins exhibit localization dynamics similar to SPR1. Together, these experiments will allow the Principal Investigators to determine how SPR1 and other plant +TIPS participate in microtubule plus end function. This project should also provide insights into the poorly understood connection between microtubules and directional cell expansion in plants. The knowledge gained on +TIPS in plants may provide a perspective that aids in the understanding of +TIPS function in animals and fungi. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>The PIs will actively recruit individuals from underrepresented groups in science to participate in this project and receive training in basic research. Project participants will include a female graduate student and a female undergraduate in Dr. Sedbrook's laboratory, and students recruited from local community colleges in Dr. Ehrhardt's laboratory. A subset of the experiments will be integrated into a biotechnology lab course run by Dr. Sedbrook that is designed to teach undergraduates and graduate students basic molecular techniques in a way that develops their critical thinking and troubleshooting skills. The Biological Sciences department at Illinois State University has recently purchased a Leica confocal microscope system with funds derived from an NSF equipment grant, so this project will allow the investigators to take full advantage of this important instrument for both research and teaching. Images and movies of dynamic microtubules in living plant cells generated from these studies will be used to enhance a variety of courses taught by the PI at Illinois State University and will be integrated into the Plant Cell Imaging web site created by the Dr. Ehrhardt. This web site features images and movies of living plant cells that reveal their fascinating inner life. This site has been profiled in Science magazine, and is used as a resource for teaching cell biology at several secondary and higher educational institutions around the country."

There is mounting evidence that liverworts (Phylum Marchantiophyta) were the first green plants to diversify on land some 500,000 million years ago and as such they are the oldest living lineage of terrestrial organisms. This species-rich group of small green plants is remarkably diverse in structure, and includes extremely ancient relictual lineages as well as more recent radiations of closely related species. The antiquity of liverworts and the rich biodiversity at all taxonomic levels provide an unparalleled window into early land plant diversification. This collaborative effort brings together experts from around the world for a multidisciplinary, highly integrated approach that combines anatomical and developmental features with DNA sequence and genome structural characters to resolve phylogenetic relationships across the entire spectrum of liverwort diversity. Three general types of data will be compiled: 1) conservative morphological and genome characters to resolve deep ""backbone"" relationships, 2) anatomical/developmental data to resolve intermediate-depth lineages, and 3) morphological and DNA sequence characters to resolve relationships among a sample of 800 taxa representing all genera of liverworts. A second major goal of the project is to integrate phylogenetic inferences and bionformatic efforts between this and other on-going NSF-supported projects, including several funded ATOL programs. These integrative activities include contributions to studies of genome structure and evolution across land plants, expansions of novel informatic tools to make methods, results, and implications widely accessible, and continued development of DNA sequence utilities that will benefit a broad range of scientists working on diverse organisms.<br/> This project relies on the cooperation with and integration among research programs focused on resolving the green plant Tree Of Life. Integrative activities are substantive and consequential, and include expansions to phylogenetic databases and methodological/conceptual aspects of work toward resolving the Tree Of Life. At least six post-doctoral associates and as many graduate students will be supported by the project, with substantial involvement of undergraduates as well. An effort to involve and retain individuals from underrepresented groups will be orchestrated through established federal programs that focus on such initiatives, including the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and the McNair Scholars Program. A solid mentoring infrastructure will be developed within each research team to provide support and professional experiences that ensure productivity and success of all participants. Outreach efforts include web presentations on the morphology and identification of liverworts for educators at all levels, development of web-based materials and a workshop targeting secondary school teachers, and increasing public awareness through weekend field excursions."

Surface wave methods have become an accepted means to characterize soil deposits for site response studies and have compared well to established borehole methods. Several active-source surface wave methodologies, having varying degrees of sophistication and efficiency, currently exist. None of these methods, however, has been studied for application to the problem of very deep profiling (300 m and greater) of sediments. Most studies in the last 20 years have focused on the top 30 m with very few studies extending beyond a depth of 100 m. With the advent of the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) large-scale field shakers, it is now possible to actively generate the low-frequency energy (down to 1.0 Hz) that is required for very deep soil profiling. <br/><br/>Field studies will be conducted at several sites in the Central United States using a variety of data collection and data processing methodologies. The findings from this work will be applicable at other deep soil sites in seismically active regions around the country, including Salt Lake City, Utah, Los Angeles, California, and Charleston, South Carolina. The deep VS profiles derived from these studies will provide an additional benefit by filling a gap in the current state of knowledge of the stiffness structure of the deep soils of the Mississippi Embayment. Predicting the ground response in this seismically active region requires knowledge of the deep sediment structure, which extends to depths of 1000 m in some areas. Recent studies of the ground response in this region have been limited by a lack of knowledge of the deep soil stiffness structure. While the near-surface sediments (top 30 m) are generally well characterized, very few measurements have been performed to depths greater than 100 m. The VS profiles measured during these studies will be important input parameters for site response studies in this region. <br/><br/>The findings from this work will be disseminated to the engineering community through peer-reviewed publications. Also, data sets will be placed on the NEES repository and will be a valuable resource for other researchers in this field. Educational field modules, demonstrating important concepts such as site resonance and soil liquefaction, will be developed by undergraduate students. These field educational modules will be included in demonstrations of this state-of-the-art field testing equipment to rural and minority K-12 students in the Central United States."

The goals include increasing the number of minority students enrolled, the establishment of permanent infrastructure on each campus to support diversity, the establishment of permanent programs on each campus and across the alliance to support diversity and a diverse population of graduate students, and the development of a publishable set of techniques and guidelines that can be used by any university and which we hope will lead to a national forum for the exchange of ideas and best practices for promoting diversity. The four key elements of the alliance include: 1) alliance-level activities (e.g., an annual student research conference and the creation of common recruiting materials and coordinated recruiting efforts; 2) recruitment through the implementation of an Alliance Visiting Scholars Program and coordination of recruiting efforts at major conferences, fairs and university visits; 3) increased retention of students by recruiting a cadre of social and behavioral professors and scholars who will provide instant, multi-level mentoring network and developing transition programs; and 4) increased activities and programs targeted at undergraduates in a wider range of universities and colleges to increase the pool of students. The number of universities in the alliance will allow the alliance to analyze the effectiveness of new strategies for broadening participation and the transference of existing techniques to new settings. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The alliance will develop written materials that can be distributed to all universities in the US and could be the basis for a national exchange of ideas about alliances as a strategy to broaden participation in US institutions of higher learning."

This research examines the economic and social processes that are driving residential segregation in urban Mexico, and how residential segregation affects individuals' life chances. Past research suggests that, historically, Mexican urban geographies of class were characterized by greater social heterogeneity, and spatial arrangements did not play a central role in structuring social interactions across social divides. However, developments of the last decade have led to greater income polarization and more exclusionary uses of public spaces. The study seeks to: 1) examine the effect of cities' employment structures, particularly earnings and occupational polarization, on residential segregation levels by income and 2) test the argument that localized social and cultural capital dynamics affect residents' employment opportunities by shaping job networks, residents' employment expectations, definitions of desirable jobs, and symbolic repertoires such as norms and attitudes towards work. In addition, this project will test this argument's claims that low-income residents would benefit from living in a mixed neighborhood because they would have access to more resourceful social networks and the learning of symbolic repertoires that could enhance their employment opportunities.<br/>This project addresses these questions by comparing residential segregation patterns between1990 and 2000 in two major Mexican cities -Guadalajara and Monterrey. The research employs a mixed-method approach. It quantitatively estimates residential segregation levels, clusters census tracts with similar socio-economic characteristics using spatial data analysis techniques, and measures the effect of employment structures on residential segregation levels. Interviews will be conducted with middle- and low-income adult household members in each of the two cities to study the extent to which neighborhood-based social networks are central to gathering information about and access to jobs.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This project adds to our understanding of residential segregation and the role of spatial arrangements in reproducing social inequalities. The research contributes to cross-cultural comparative studies by using standard measures of residential segregation in Latin American that are well known in the USA and Western Europe."

For example, predicting storms over California several days in advance requires good models of the weather development and precise and accurate knowledge of weather variables such as temperature and pressure in distributed regions of the Pacific. Acquiring this precise knowledge of the current system state typically requires a large number of sensor measurements, but the quality of the subsequent prediction is a strong function of both the total sensor resources available (number and kind of sensors), and also how the sensors are used (the spatio-temporal distribution of the sensors). Current sensor systems fly a few manned planes with long time horizons, selecting from a handful of possible flight paths. While useful, the resulting measurement strategies are essentially uncoordinated, preprogrammed and not easily modified. There are often inconsistencies between the assumptions in the data assimilation, ensemble construction (Monte Carlo sampling), and targeting methodologies, which lead to sub-optimal plans for data gathering. UAVs have been developed to reduce the costs of manned flights, and we envisage a scenario with multiple UAVs using distributed sensing techniques to significantly reduce the planner response times. Our research will lead to a new framework for coordinating this team of mobile sensing assets that provides more efficient measurement strategies and a more accurate means of capturing spatial correlations in weather system dynamics. We will also demonstrate the importance of using consistent strategies for the data assimilation, ensemble construction, and targeting. The key step in this work will be to exploit the structure inherent in weather system dynamics to develop a unique hybrid central/distributed planning strategy that uses both multi-resolution optimization techniques to solve the global task assignment and reinforcement learning to solve the local task planning problems. The planning algorithms resulting from this work will be applicable to a wide range of systems that also exhibit strong coupling through both the information (measurements taken by one influence the world models of all) and the tasks (standard conflict avoidance).<br/><br/>This research will facilitate a strong linkage between the nonlinear weather prediction and planning/control communities. By synergistically combining technologies from two diverse fields, our research effort within the DDDAS program will develop a new measurement strategy for weather prediction that closely links model predictions and adaptive observations. Our work will extend and apply new coordination techniques for teams of UAVs that have been recently developed for other (mainly DoD) applications. This represents a paradigm shift in active weather sensing models, in that this project will be the first to show how a network of mobile sensors can be used efficiently to optimize the data gathering that drives predictions of natural phenomena such as weather. Our results could lead to substantially better weather predictions, which in the future could save lives and money."

The focus will be on interactivity both inside and outside of classes so that students obtain hands-on experience in local and distributed virtual domains in addition to what they generally learn in laboratory courses. The desired goal is to allow students to achieve a deeper understanding of basic principles, especially for phenomena difficult or impractical to illustrate in physical laboratories. The new curriculum will include: (a) integration of module contents with materials preceding and following the module (interconnectivity), (b) engineering context of governing equations and physical principles underlying modular contents through information, data and video-images, all accessed from web-resources, (c) hierarchical arrangement of modular contents so that students can set their own level of learning goals, and set their own pace to achieve them, and (d) integration of visualization, computation and analysis (VISCOMPANA), three critical methodologies of the engineering profession.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed project will be the long-term educational and career benefits to the large number of students and faculty who will be affected by the curricular transformation. Integration of advanced education technology tools such as interactive visualization and simulation modules in the curricula will enhance student learning, improve quality of engineering education, and prepare graduates who possess engineering know-how to practice in a world transformed by computer and Internet technologies.

Enrollments in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) disciplines are not rising as fast as needed to support future projections of industrial growth. Female students in particular are expected to benefit from the proposed work. That is, since women in engineering have been found to be generally more averse to hardware related courses than are male students, the visualization and simulation enhanced courses will provide female students an alternative pathway for hands-on experience.

Solomon, Mark A. Burns and Joanna Mirecki Millunchick, University of Michigan<br/><br/>The assembly of nanocolloids into useful structures is key to emergent applications of nanoscale science and engineering. Yet, the initial impact of assembly has been limited because of the disappointingly small number of unit cells assembled to date. Because of their reduced symmetry relative to spheres, ready availability of nanocolloids with anisotropic shape and interactions would improve the scope for assembly of ordered arrays with novel morphology. However, the development of methods to produce anisotropic particles is in its infancy. Methods available are laborious and/or capital intensive and often neither flexible nor scalable. Here we will develop a versatile nanofluidic platform for the rapid manufacture of nanocolloids with anisotropic shape and interactions. This exploratory project combines an interdisciplinary team with strong capabilities in particle synthesis, lithography, fluidics and focused ion beam (FIB) patterning in pursuit of this aim.<br/><br/>On chip fluidic processing is an efficient way to direct, mix, react and analyze minute amounts of reactants and products. We aim to apply nanofluidic technology to direct, order and link chains of individual nanocolloids in nanoscale channels. The ordering and linking will provide the desired shape and interaction anisotropy. Nanofabrication and FIB methods will be used to construct a nanofluidic processor that can be replicated into parallel processors for large-scale production. Through syntheses of monodisperse nanocolloids of poly(methyl methacrylate) and silica with different steric layer chemistry, we have available particles with differing potential interactions, here labeled as nanocolloids ""A"" and ""B."" Their size is controlled and as small as 40 nm. The proposed nanofluidic processor will yield linked, permanently bonded chains of nanocolloids with ordering of A and B that is variable and specifiable. Our initial aim, for example, will be to produce a ""nano-surfactant"" of type B-B-A-A-A-A. The device function will be: By a software-programmed sequence of pressure actuations, A and B particles are alternately fed single-file to a narrow channel in the desired sequence. Matching the channel cross-section to the particle diameter yields single-file motion that conserves the sequence order. The particles are then conveyed into a reaction zone where a flow constriction immobilizes and compresses the sequence so that adjacent particles are in contact. A surface coupling reaction (initiated by UV excitation) then covalently binds the particles into the anisotropic sequence specified by the fluidic ordering. The device will first be developed at scales of ~ 500 nm so that fluidic control and operation can be optimized through in situ visualization with two-channel confocal fluorescence microscopy. The device will then be scaled down for manufacturing with ~ 50 nm building blocks. The products of the manufacturing will be used to perform initial assembly studies.<br/><br/>Our idea to apply nanofluidics for nanocolloid synthesis has intellectual merit because: (1) fluidic processing allows precise control of the relative orientation of particles needed for high fidelity synthesis; (2) the scheme uses continuous (rather than batch) processing and thus achieves a true manufacturing capability. The materials will be used for initial fundamental engineering science studies of anisotropic particle assembly that could not be accomplished in any other way. In addition to the outcomes of graduate education and outreach to middle school girls, the broader impact of the work will be to establish that nanofluidics and nanopatterning can be applied to solve a difficult problem in nanocolloid synthesis. The project will: (1) make possible routine synthesis of anisotropic particles in academic laboratories, thereby increasing the scope for assembly studies nationwide; (2) render feasible the possibility of large-scale, commercial manufacturing of specialty anisotropic nanocolloids for such applications as chemical sensing and photonic band gap materials. The principal research and education theme that this proposal addresses is ""Manufacturing processes at the nanoscale."""

This project takes three complementary approaches to control the conjugated polymer morphology leading to efficient charge separation and electrical continuity. The first approach will control phase segregation in conjugated polymer/fullerene blends using electrostatic interactions between oppositely-charged polymers and fullerene derivatives. The second approach will use a semiconducting polymer donor contained within a periodic nanoporous inorganic framework that functions as the electron acceptor. The third approach will use self-assembly to directly create nanoperiodic conjugated polymer/electron-acceptor networks using novel amphiphilic conjugated polymers. <br/><br/>Conjugated polymers are novel materials combining the optical and electrical properties of semiconductors with the processing advantage and mechanical properties of plastics. This set of properties can lead to improved optoelectronic devices and potentially low-cost, efficient solar cells.

Although sensors<br/>and measuring devices have existed since the early days of science, miniaturization, integration, wireless<br/>technologies, and advances in computing are paving the way for developments of very large scale<br/>networks of sensing devices, embedded unobtrusively in a wide array of environments. Under this new<br/>emerging paradigm, reliability, accuracy, and long term autonomous operation become vital factors in<br/>the design and use of practical systems.<br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity: The goal of a sensing system is often to<br/>detect, observe, and learn things about the environment, involving tasks such as signal detection,<br/>estimation, classi.cation, or other data analysis operations. These tasks are especially challenging in<br/>networked sensor systems for the following reasons: First, it is di.cult to collect data at arbitrary<br/>points in time and space as needed. The restricted nature of the measurement process can place severe<br/>limitations on the achievable accuracy of inference schemes. Second, calibrating sensor network systems<br/>is extremely di.cult due to their decentralized nature. Third, sensor network data analysis tasks can be<br/>ill-posed because of the limitations on sampling and calibration. Fourth, key resources such as power,<br/>bandwidth, and computing devices are often very limited. This places severe restrictions on the amount<br/>of communication and computation that can take place in a sensor network.<br/>Detection, estimation, classi.cation, calibration, and communication, each, in their own right, pose<br/>very challenging new problems in the context of large-scale sensor networks. Moreover, as a consequence<br/>of the four issues raised, distributed sensing, processing, and communication are fundamentally interconnected. Our approach to this challenging new domain rests on investigating the following key<br/>principles: distributed algorithms, complexity management, sensory feedback, and the seamless integration<br/>of sensing, processing, and communications. Distributed Algorithms for in-network data<br/>processing and communications eliminate the need to transmit raw sensor data to a central point.<br/>They can provide signi.cant reductions in the amount of communication and energy required to obtain<br/>an accurate estimate. Furthermore, distributed algorithms are much more robust and reliable<br/>in the presence of communication errors, network outages, and component degradation. Complexity<br/>Regularization provides theory and practical methodologies for coping with trade-o.s between<br/>model complexity/.exibility and over.tting to limited data. Sensor Feedback allows for dynamic<br/>resource allocation, enabling potentially dramatic gains in the use of precious resources such as power,<br/>bandwidth, and data processors. Integration of sensing, processing and communication operations is<br/>critical for reliable, accurate, and long-term environmental monitoring using networks of sensors.<br/>This project will develop a new theory and a suite of algorithms for practical sensor network systems.<br/>The algorithms will be analyzed theoretically and tested experimentally. The testbed will consist of<br/>optic, acoustic, thermal and other sources and sensors, networked using IEEE 802.15.4 compliant nodes.<br/>The combination of these sensors will enable in depth exploration of complex issues including the<br/>characterization of spatio-temporal environmental variation, multimodal sensing, and the integration of<br/>sensing, data processing, and communication.<br/>Broader Impact: This project will provide a unique platform for training graduate and undergraduate<br/>students by exposing them to a broad variety of challenges in designing networked sensor systems from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. The topics of the proposed research are an integral part of a new graduate level course o.ering by the PI at the University of Wisconsin Madison Electrical and Computer Engineering Department dealing with networked embedded systems (ECE 902). Furthermore, involvement of minorities and women in the project will be encouraged via various existing programs at the University of Wisconsin. Currently three female graduate students are being supervised by one of the PI's. This project will also facilitate collaborations with local industry who have expressed strong interest and committed to furnishing the hardware and software components necessary in build the experimental testbed."

Clinker dominates the topographic form of many of the basins in which it is found, because it is more resistant to weathering than surrounding unaltered bedrock. It also preserves a record of the spatial-temporal patterns of fluvial incision, lateral backwasting, and plateau formation in these landscapes, because coal only burns when close to the surface, above the water table and ventilated with surface oxygen. Using (U-Th)/He ages of detrital zircons that are reset during clinker formation, we will map the patterns of coal burning and shallow exhumation in detail in several regions of the PRB in Wyoming and Montana, as well as characterize clinker ages over a broader scale throughout the basin. Model predictions of clinker age-patterns in individual drainages and across the landscape suggest that our results will be able to discriminate between at least some of these possible climatological or tectonic mechanisms driving landscape evolution.

Despite the benefits derived from transnational interactions, critics maintain that these relations are shaping organizational agendas and actions. With environmental decision-making around the world becoming more inclusive, and policy implementation more dependent on environmental organizations, the ability of these groups to represent their constituencies and take action in accord with their mission and goals is an increasingly significant issue. Therefore, this research examines the extent that the activities of domestic environmental organizations are driven by organizational mission and goals as opposed to transnational actors and initiatives. To address this issue, interviews will be conducted to trace the development, goals, and activities of three environmental organizations in the Czech Republic relative to their interactions with transnational actors and initiatives over time. The findings from the interviews will provide a basis for the second phase of research, a survey of national environmental organizations in four countries in Central and Eastern Europe that recently joined the European Union. The results from this inquiry will generate new insights that contribute to scholarship on transnationalism and diffusion, internal processes within social movement organizations, and democratic transition and maintenance. The project also will have broad policy and educational impacts. This includes providing graduate students with opportunities to gain research experience in domestic and international contexts. In addition, the interview materials will be incorporated into an archive and information about the history and activities of Czech environmental organizations will be made available through the project website. Further, a policy report summarizing survey findings related to current challenges that environmental groups in Central and Eastern Europe are facing as a consequence of accession to the European Union will be produced and disseminated."

Clearing for agriculture represents one of the most common forms of human disturbance in the tropics, while hurricanes pose the greatest threat of natural disturbance for forests of the Caribbean. To investigate the relative importance of human and hurricane disturbance in tropical forests the investigators will conduct a census of the diameter, species and location of all trees in the 16 hectare Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP). The census results will be compared with previous censuses taken in 1990, 1995 and 2000. A portion of the LFDP was used for agriculture prior to 1934, and Hurricanes Hugo (1989) and Georges (1998) both caused considerable damage. Together, data from the four censuses will allow us to contrast tree population dynamics during intervals that have experienced very different patterns of hurricane disturbance, and for parts of the forest with different agricultural land use histories. We will develop new analyses of the census data, using likelihood methods to examine how the spatial configuration of trees within the forest and patterns of disturbance by hurricanes change the dynamics of the most common tree species. Future work will integrate our results using a forest simulation model. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of our research include contributing to the global network of tropical forest plots as part of the Center For Tropical Forest Science. This network has been central to the attempts of ecologists to understand the structure and function of tropical forests. Our research will also develop new methods for the analysis of long-term data in tropical forests - these methods can then be used more widely across the network. The project will provide research experience for a large number of undergraduate and particularly minority students in tropical ecology."

Few seedlings grow beyond a few years; saplings are rare. Oak roots depend on beneficial fungi in the form of mycorrhizas, modified roots that form a symbiotic association between the oak trees and the fungi. Fungi provide water and nutrients to trees; trees provide sugars to fungi. Many mycorrhizal fungi are species of truffles. Their spores cannot be dispersed by air because the fruiting bodies remain closed underground. So the problem for the oaks is two-fold: acorns must be dispersed away from the parent tree to avoid competition, and they require fungi to make mycorrhizas. One possibility is that small mammals eat the truffles and disperse the spores. The goal of this proposal is to determine the roles of fungi and small mammals in oak regeneration. The objectives are to (1) assess the availability of fungi for mycorrhizal formation at distances away from mature oaks; (2) measure the effect of absence of fungal sources on seedling growth, and (3) determine the potential of small mammals to disperse mycorrhizal fungi.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed work include (1) engaging undergraduate students in research and (2) collaboration with land managers to preserve and regenerate oak habitat. Students will be responsible for parts of the project, and will present their work at scientific meetings. The PIs will communicate with applied scientists in environmental organizations and federal agencies, and with private land owners, attending meetings and conferences. They will give talks and provide handouts about oak ecology and management of oak habitat."

Iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and its redox cycling exerts a strong influence on the behavior of various organic and inorganic compounds in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The structure and function of microbial communities associated with Fe redox cycling in near-surface environments is therefore an important topic in environmental microbiology and biogeochemistry. This project addresses several unique aspects of microbial community structure and physiology related to Fe redox cycling and biomineralization in modern subsoils and shallow groundwater environments. Such environments are primary receptors of both natural and anthropogenic materials (e.g. run-off from urban and agricultural systems), and microorganisms play a key role in subsurface biogeochemical processes.<br/>The proposed research will explore novel strategies that microbial populations and communities may utilize to derive energy from Fe redox cycling, and will examine the mineralogical signatures of such activities. Experimental reactive transport systems will be used to mimic natural subsurface environments in which temporal variations in the input of electron donors and acceptors are expected to strongly influence microbial community development and patterns of Fe biomineralization. The experimental systems will support microbial communities from either a freshwater wetland surface sediment or shallow Atlantic Coastal plain aquifer sediment. We hypothesize that the energy available from Fe and nitrogen redox interactions will lead to the development of microbial populations and/or communities specifically adapted to take advantage of the energy available during redox oscillations. In addition, we anticipate that the Fe mineralogy of sediments subject to redox fluctuations will evolve toward a suite of metastable minerals of relative low crystallinity and high reactivity relative to those in sediments under stable redox conditions. The reactor systems to be developed in this study represent novel research techniques for examining linkages between microbial physiology, community structure, biogeochemical reaction dynamics, and Fe biomineralization. The geomicrobiological and biogeochemical information gained from these model systems will be incorporated into a microbial energetics-based numerical simulation framework that will allow the results of our experimental studies to be transferred to a variety of surface and subsurface sedimentary environments.<br/>The project will train two Ph.D. students in multidisciplinary biogeochemical research methodologies as well as techniques for numerical simulation of biogeochemical processes and microbial population dynamics in sediments. An undergraduate intern will participate in microbial culturing and isolation at IU. The UW Ph.D. student will participate in the training of a summer Research Experience for Teachers (RET) fellow. The RET fellow will conduct original research, and travel to scientific meetings to present his or her research during the last two years of the project. The UW Ph.D. student will also participate in the NSF-sponsored Center for Integration of Research, Training, and Learning (CIRTL) program at UW, which offers courses and coordinates internship programs that provide practical experience in bringing science to the broader community. In addition to these activities, IU will undertake a novel collaboration with the Fulbright Academy of Science and Technology (FAST) aimed at increasing public understanding about the importance of environmental microbiology. We will work with FAST to develop presentation modules that will be offered by FAST members at selected locations around the U.S. The general presentations will cover topics of current interest to the public such as the role of bacteria in the metabolism of greenhouse gases, degradation of pollutants, and nutrient cycling (specifically N and Fe) in soils and sediments."

Convergence in function would mean that ecological understanding and conservation strategies could be generalized worldwide. But contingent factors specific to a region, such as differences in history or the types of grazers present may lead to unique responses in some savanna grasslands. The goal of this research is to compare key ecological processes to fire and grazing in savanna grasslands in North America and South Africa. Scientists will take advantage of three ongoing long-term experiments that manipulate these key factors and compare responses in productivity, biodiversity, and nutrient cycling. <br/><br/>As humans alter fire and grazing regimes worldwide, comparative research elucidating the consequences is needed to develop management strategies that can insure the sustainability of savanna grasslands. This research will provide the basic knowledge necessary to do so, and will afford training and important global and cultural experiences for young scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students.<br/>"

Arguments for showing slow mixing, or the inefficiency, of Markov chains and the presence of phase transitions typically rely on sophisticated counting arguments. A new approach based on topological obstructions is suggested that would greatly simplify these arguments and moreover would strengthen known results. This will be explored in the context of independent sets and colorings in fixed dimensional lattices. A related topic examined in this proposal concerns the effects of boundary conditions on the mixing rates of certain Markov chains. Boundary conditions play a crucial role in the study of phase transitions of statistical physics models on the infinite lattice, so understanding their influence on the mixing rate of finite chains could provide insights for both the design of algorithms and the behavior of the underlying systems.<br/><br/>Over the last ten years, a new interdisciplinary field has emerged at the interface of discrete probability, computer science and statistical physics. The research component of this proposal explores new directions for enhancing the connections between these fields in order to design better algorithms and study phase transitions of physical systems. Many of the questions posed, and the technical tools suggested for their solutions, are the result of a bilateral interplay between fields. This research will be supplemented through an educational component. Starting in Fall 2006, the P.I. will be chairing the organizing committee of a DIMACS/Georgia Tech special focus on ""Discrete Random Systems,"" concentrating on this area of interdisciplinary research. In addition to the typical workshops bringing together leading researchers in the relevant areas, there will also be workshops and working groups promoting broader impact, both in terms of participants and topics. Tutorials will be included when beneficial."

I propose to improve the utilitty of biogeochemical watershed models by developing improved techniques of hypothesis testing using recently developed multi-criteria calibration techniques. Three questions will be addressed: (1) What are the benefits of distributed models of catchment biogeochemistry? (2) How do we incorporate multiple fluxes and state variables into our judgment of how well a model is performing? (3) How do we use different types of data in evaluating what is wrong with a model? Preliminary results with multi-media methods have shown promise in solving the hypothesis-testing challenge of biogeochemical watershed models. I will foster the development of these methods through both education and fundamental research into these techniques. I will develop an innovative group project on watershed mass balance models for the general hydrology course I teach. The graduate education portion of the project will involve lecture and collective learning in small groups using a simple bucket model of watershed processes. The group project will take the students from the rudiments of model construction to the tools available for model calibration and model evaluation of lumped as well as distributed hydrologic models. This course will form the foundation for the biogeochemical watershed modeling group I hope to create. The research I propose will focus on the development of multi-criteria model calibration and evaluation tools for multi-process biogeochemical watershed models. The proposed work includes testing the AHM model of the Emerald Lake watershed using ""true"" (testing for parameter uniqueness and identification) and real data sets using the available multi-criteria evaluation tools. Model calibration will be conducted for several scenarios comparing the level of spatial aggregation, time series duration, and the kinds of data available (outflow time series in addition to spatial data of soil conditions). These studies will investigate the utility of distributed biogeochemical watershed models and what sort of data is needed to properly parameterize and evaluate these models. I will also conduct similar modeling studies with agricultural non-point source models with the assistance of a post-doctoral associate trained in agricultural engineering. Finally, I will establish a biogeochemical watershed processes field site at the San Diego Experimental Forest."

Methods of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and probabilistic statistics will be applied to obtain a hierarchy of stochastic Lagrangian models of varying complexity. Models will be verified using a first-exit time concept and probability weighted moment techniques. The approach will utilize shorter observation series than traditional methods used in oceanography, be robust to the effects of noise in the measurements, and account for inhomogeneity of wave-eddy oceanic fields. The effectiveness of the mathematical technique will be illustrated by estimating Lagrangian statistics and ocean currents using subsurface float observations from the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans.<br/><br/>Robust mathematical techniques will be developed for the analysis of the motion of floats and drifters in the ocean. The higher accuracy of these new techniques will improve the description of mean velocity fields as well as those for the path and dispersal of ocean waters. Computational efficiencies may allow more efficient assimilation of Lagrangian data into numerical ocean models. Results will allow a better understanding and description of the exchange of ocean waters between various geographic regions such as the continental margin and the deep ocean or between Subtropical and Subarctic ocean gyres. Results will contribute to related problems such as estimating the carbon export from the continental margin to the deep sea, the sequestration of carbon dioxide in Subtropical regions, and the dispersal of pollutants in the ocean. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposal will involve graduate students and young scientists including women from the Naval Postgraduate School (Monterey, CA), University of Southern California (Los Angeles, CA) as well as other Monterey area institutions (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, and Pacific Fisheries Environmental Laboratory). Current velocity and diffusivity will be used to forecast biological productivity along the Central California Coast. In collaboration with researchers from the Southampton (U.K.) Oceanographic Center, the methods developed will be applied to ARGO float observations collected in the North Atlantic in order to reconstruct and understand variability of mid depth ocean circulation. This will contribute the ARGO program, the Global Ocean and Climate Observing Systems. Activities will include open scientific communications as well as presentations to the broader community. To assure the dissemination of the research to the broadest possible scientific and public audience, project results will be published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature in a timely manner; and presented at scientific conferences and workshops in the United States and abroad. Interim working papers and graphical representations will be posted on web- sites in the *.edu domain. Research results will be converted into teaching aids for graduate and undergraduate courses in easy-to-use formats, such as visual animations and Microsoft PowerPoint presentations and will also be available via Internet for policy-makers and the public at large. These educational materials may also be used for a graduate-level marine science textbook on problems of determining circulation properties using Lagrangian floats and drifters."

This proposal involves experiments to apply ground<br/>penetrating radar (GPR) for (1) estimating the amount of biogenic gas stored in peatlands,<br/>(2) determining the spatial distribution of biogenic gas within the peat, and (3)<br/>monitoring biogenic gas release to the atmosphere. Data from a large northern peatland in<br/>Maine (EAR-0242353) show that (1) higher CH4 and CO2 concentrations correlate with<br/>high velocity/high attenuation zones in cross-borehole GPR data as well as shadow zones<br/>(loss of reflections) in surface GPR data, (2) shadow zones (indicative of high gas<br/>content) are frequently observed in the +11 km of surface GPR data collected in this<br/>peatland. The experimental objectives are: (1) a laboratory evaluation of the relationship<br/>between dielectric permittivity and gas content for a profile of peat cores from the surface<br/>to the mineral soil; (2) a cross-hole GPR and surface GPR monitoring experiment,<br/>supported by measurements of water levels, hydraulic conductivity and time domain<br/>reflectometry, to observe rates of biogenic gas release to the atmosphere; (3) a surface<br/>GPR study, supported by in situ measurements of biogenic gas concentration, to estimate<br/>the volume of biogenic gas stored in two well studied northern peatlands (Caribou Bog,<br/>ME and Glacial Lake Agassiz, MN). Important milestones include (a) a predictive<br/>equation for gas content estimation in peat as a function of depth from dielectric<br/>permittivity measurements, (b) new insight into the temporal pattern of gas release and<br/>ebullition flux from peatlands, and (c) new estimates of the free gas content of peatland<br/>carbon reservoirs accounting for the spatial/depth distribution of the gas.<br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This proposal incorporates educational activities, curriculum development, community<br/>outreach and international collaboration within an applied research framework. Honors<br/>UnderGraduate (HUG) researchers from the Rutgers-Newark Honors College (HC) will<br/>partner with a postdoctoral scientist to obtain the research training required to complete<br/>four of the primary research tasks. Each HUG will complete a yearlong senior project on<br/>their research and contribute to a publication. The status of Rutgers-Newark as the topranked<br/>National US University with respect to campus UG diversity facilitates HUG<br/>opportunities to minority students. Students in Earth/Environmental Sciences at Rutgers-<br/>Newark frequently express interest in fieldwork experiences. Part of the fieldwork will be<br/>conducted by students participating in a new class, Summer Field Camp in Applied<br/>Geophysics, developed as part of this project. Community outreach will occur via guided<br/>tours, poster boards and presentations on the hydrology, ecology and carbon cycle in<br/>Caribou Bog, facilitated by the recently opened 2 km long Orono boardwalk that now<br/>provides public access to this bog.

The project targets first generation college students and historically underrepresented student populations to increase their enrollment, retention and graduation in Life Sciences. We chose this set of disciplines because (1) there is a dearth of first-generation and historically underrepresented students studying in these areas, (2) the strength of the University of Connecticut programs in these fields, (3) existing good articulation agreements between the University of Connecticut and these three community colleges, (4) the geographic position of the participating institutions in the ""biotechnology corridor,"" and (5) the relevance of these programs for regional 21st Century employment opportunities. <br/><br/>This project targets first generation students, many of whom are African American and Latino/a, who may choose to go to community college as the primary way of accessing higher education. Historically, these students have limited access to higher education opportunities. Rising costs of post-secondary education, combined with increased competition for admissions to competitive institutions like the University of Connecticut, and deficient college preparatory curricula in many Connecticut high schools, dramatically constrict the educational opportunities for many of these students. This project addresses these challenges by pooling resources across institutions to offer an academic development and leadership program focusing on: (1) rigorous individual and group academic support for the core science and math courses, (2) mentoring relationships in the sciences through undergraduate research opportunity initiatives, (3) leadership and identity enhancement activities to overcome psychological challenges in the form of stereotyping and low self-esteem, and (4) overall development of students' professional identities of becoming scientists (through mentoring, research, and internship experiences). <br/><br/>The project is being guided by a leadership team of faculty, key stakeholders, and an executive oversight committee of senior officers drawn from all four schools and around the state. Diversifying the student bodies is a strategic priority for all member institutions within the STRONG-CT Alliance. By focusing efforts on enhancing the number of first generation and historically underrepresented students taking science courses at these community colleges, and then encouraging their transfer to the University of Connecticut, degree output will be increased because -- lacking this program -- they would not be studying in any of the STEM fields. Long-term, it is clear that working with community college partners is a critical next step to increasing the numbers of historically underserved students who complete bachelor degrees in these areas. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal is that it pulls together a wide diversity of individuals from a major land grant university and its neighboring community colleges to address significant recruitment and retention problems in an integrated and powerful manner. Practices that have been developed locally through the LSAMP program are being extended to the community college setting to maximize student success in the life sciences. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this initiative go beyond the recruitment and graduation of additional first-generation and minority students to the selected STEM disciplines. It is changing the cultures and practices of the participating institutions to better educate all of their constituent students. The model developed here for increasing and integrating the collaboration and articulation between two-year colleges and four-year institutions in STEM is attractive for budgetary reasons and also because it builds on the strengths of the participating institutions."

There is mounting evidence that liverworts (Phylum Marchantiophyta) were the first green plants to diversify on land some 500,000 million years ago and as such they are the oldest living lineage of terrestrial organisms. This species-rich group of small green plants is remarkably diverse in structure, and includes extremely ancient relictual lineages as well as more recent radiations of closely related species. The antiquity of liverworts and the rich biodiversity at all taxonomic levels provide an unparalleled window into early land plant diversification. This collaborative effort brings together experts from around the world for a multidisciplinary, highly integrated approach that combines anatomical and developmental features with DNA sequence and genome structural characters to resolve phylogenetic relationships across the entire spectrum of liverwort diversity. Three general types of data will be compiled: 1) conservative morphological and genome characters to resolve deep ""backbone"" relationships, 2) anatomical/developmental data to resolve intermediate-depth lineages, and 3) morphological and DNA sequence characters to resolve relationships among a sample of 800 taxa representing all genera of liverworts. A second major goal of the project is to integrate phylogenetic inferences and bionformatic efforts between this and other on-going NSF-supported projects, including several funded ATOL programs. These integrative activities include contributions to studies of genome structure and evolution across land plants, expansions of novel informatic tools to make methods, results, and implications widely accessible, and continued development of DNA sequence utilities that will benefit a broad range of scientists working on diverse organisms.<br/> This project relies on the cooperation with and integration among research programs focused on resolving the green plant Tree Of Life. Integrative activities are substantive and consequential, and include expansions to phylogenetic databases and methodological/conceptual aspects of work toward resolving the Tree Of Life. At least six post-doctoral associates and as many graduate students will be supported by the project, with substantial involvement of undergraduates as well. An effort to involve and retain individuals from underrepresented groups will be orchestrated through established federal programs that focus on such initiatives, including the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and the McNair Scholars Program. A solid mentoring infrastructure will be developed within each research team to provide support and professional experiences that ensure productivity and success of all participants. Outreach efforts include web presentations on the morphology and identification of liverworts for educators at all levels, development of web-based materials and a workshop targeting secondary school teachers, and increasing public awareness through weekend field excursions."

Funds will be distributed to U.S. cartographers whose applications are evaluated using a number of criteria associated with active participation in the meeting. Travel grants will be given to more junior scientists in order to encourage their participation in international discussions and communications.<br/><br/>This award will foster greater participation by U.S. cartographers in the global forum of the International Cartographic Association. As has been demonstrated in follow-up reports from Americans who have been supported with previous travel grants to other major international meetings, opportunities abound for meeting professional colleagues from many other nations, for hearing ideas and information from a broad range of different perspectives, and for participating in discussions that frequently result in successful research collaborations. These meetings will be especially important because of their locations. The 2003 ICA conference will be the first held in Africa, and the theme for this meeting is ""Cartography for Development.""

On a global scale, the consequence of intensive food production is closely linked to the health and stability of both biophysical and human systems. In the Midwestern U.S., the almost-complete replacement of perennial-dominated vegetation by annual crops has significantly impacted environmental services that maintain function and stability of both the human and biophysical systems. The possibility that these trends can be reversed through the re-introduction of perennial vegetation into agricultural landscapes is underscored by two parallel processes: (1) the increasing emphasis of agricultural policies on promoting conservation practices that incorporate perennial plants, and (2) increasing evidence from field and modeling studies suggesting that increasing perennial cover may significantly enhance both ecological and socioeconomic benefits. Fundamental scientific knowledge is sorely lacking, however, with respect to the complex causes and feedbacks within the human and biophysical systems that will ultimately determine the degree and direction of these changes in perennial-annual systems. This project will integrate a watershed-scale field experiment with modeling simulations to assess coupled ecological and socioeconomic dynamics and trade-offs associated with integrating perennial vegetation in agroecosystems dominated by annual crops in the Midwest. The project will be conducted at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in the Walnut Creek watershed in central Iowa, where approximately one-third of the watershed has been converted to native prairie vegetation, producing a mosaic landscape of agricultural lands and native prairie vegetation that provides an ideal context for this research. The core hypothesis for this research is that strategic locations, amounts, and types of perennial plant cover within agriculturally-dominated landscapes will have a disproportionate effect on the functioning of the biophysical (i.e., water quality and flow, biodiversity) and socioeconomic (i.e., quality of life, economic and social stability) systems. The main objective of this project is to develop an environmental-efficiency index derived from baseline economic and biophysical data that will enable assessment of the extent to which different landscape designs having contrasting annual-perennial plant configurations optimize ecosystem functioning and socioeconomic benefits. This project will include parameterizing, validating, and explicitly linking biophysical and economic models that will be used to assess the environmental benefits and economic costs of various perennial-annual watershed scenarios.<br/><br/>This project will have significant impacts on science and society by developing novel approaches to assessing biocomplexity in agricultural landscapes and by providing knowledge that will contribute to policies aimed at effecting positive environmental and socioeconomic change. The project will result in a prototypic decision-making tool that can be applied by a range of governmental agencies and civil society organizations to guide management and policy decisions, thereby offering a scientific basis for assessing trade-offs of alternative intensively managed landscapes. It will establish a scientific understanding of the full societal costs and benefits of integrating perennial vegetation into annually dominated agricultural systems and of the complex dynamics currently influencing adoption and payments of conservation practices that is needed for more effective policy formulation. The project will enhance knowledge of biocomplexity of intensively managed systems and alternative watershed design options within society as a whole by providing educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as through public education and outreach activities conducted through the refuge's learning center that will target a wide range of stakeholders (e.g., policy makers, school children, farmers, etc.). The results and approach developed through this project will have broad applications to assessing trade-offs of alternative intensively managed landscapes and guiding management and policy decisions in other regions in the U.S. and abroad. This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems."

The channel's dispersive nature and spatial fading patterns will determine the system's radio coverage, bit error rates, transmission efficiency, call capacity, power control, antenna diversity, and a host of other issues. The main drawback of deterministic propagation models is that they require a large number of site specific information to produce accurate results. The information include a detail map of the location of each scatterer and their physical dimensions. The electric characteristics of the material for each scatterer is also required, although this information is much more difficult to obtain and often impossible to quantify simply. The purpose of this small exploratory project is to study the integration of the measured propagation path characteristics into a deterministic propagation simulation model. The research planned will include the measurement of a wideband signal in a college campus environment, the separation of the measured signal into its dominant multipath components, and the detail analysis of each path to determine the number and the degree of signal attenuation at each interaction. Individual multipaths from the measurement will be uniquely identified according to their propagation delay and direction of arrival at the receiver. Simulations using the Vertical Plane Launch (VPL) method will be performed on a detailed virtual representation of the same physical environment. The simulated propagation paths will be used to steer the measurement to the direction of the expected arrivals of the signal. The simulations will incorporate the scattering coefficients derived from the analysis of the measurements and the enhanced results will be studied to assess its accuracy. Issues such as the level of detail required in the simulation, and the multipath resolution of the measurements will be examined to determine its impact on this closed loop system."

Our goal is to determine the mechanisms by which species interactions and common environmental stressors influence disease properties and community dynamics. Our focal hosts are amphibians, a group of global conservation concern that has been impacted by the recent emergence of infectious diseases. The focal parasites are the trematodes (flatworms) Ribeiroia ondatrae and Echinostoma trivolvis. They are transmitted from snails to amphibians and induce mortality associated with limb deformities and kidney damage, respectively. Our hypothesis is that trematode transmission, associated mortality, and amphibian fitness will depend upon community composition and abiotic stressors. We will conduct surveys to identify relationships among amphibian trematode infections and biotic and abiotic characteristics of wetlands and their surrounding landscape. We will use mesocosm communities to examine how the independent and combined effects of competition and predation (biotic stressors) and pesticides and conditions associated with climate change (abiotic stressors) influence amphibian fitness and disease properties. Additionally, we will elucidate the relationships among amphibian immune responses and biotic and abiotic stressors and infection risk by conducting immunological assays on amphibians from each of our experiments. Finally, we will formulate predictive mathematical models for the spread of trematodes in human-altered environments. This project represents a pioneering effort in the integration of community ecology, immunology, and epidemiology that will improve our ability to forecast future vector-borne disease outbreaks by shedding light on general principles governing host-parasite interactions."

It aims to understand the time that it takes for non-equilibrium spin distributions to disappear once they are created. All semiconductor materials will be considered, but there will be a particular focus on silicon and gallium arsenide, which have the most technological importance. Furthermore, the devices under consideration confine the motion of the electrons in a way that affects the spin decay. This will also be taken into account. There are multiple causes for this spin decay or relaxation. This will necessitate the development of computer programs to handle the complex interaction of different mechanisms.<br/><br/>Broad Impact<br/>Most of the important technological advances in the last 50 years have been closely associated with the progress of electronics, which, in physical terms, is the manipulation of electronic charge. In computer technology in particular, this manipulation is done in semiconductors. This steady advance has shown signs of slowing in the last decade or so, and the future will depend on the manipulation of electronic spin - the field of spintronics. This proposal aims at increasing our theoretical understanding of the behavior of electron spins in semiconductors. This area is the most promising for technology in the short term, since spintronics in semiconductors would allow rapid integration with current manufacturing techniques.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit<br/>Many basic mechanisms of spin relaxation in semiconductors are reasonably well understood. However, crucial difficulties remain. The effect of magnetic fields, doping ranges and particularly geometry of devices introduce complications that can change the relaxation in very significant ways. The work proposed here focuses on some novel physical mechanisms that we believe are central to understanding these unresolved issues. The most important of these novel insights is spin transfer between extended and localized states. This is not a spin relaxation in itself, since the transfer conserves spin, but the transfer accelerates spin relaxation. A second point is the unexpectedly large field dependence of the spin-phonon relaxation due to symmetry considerations and the phonon density of states. These insights will be incorporated into computer calculations of spin relaxation from all mechanisms to achieve quantitative understanding of relaxation times. This will be a major advance the theory of spin relaxation in semiconductors."

The framework is distinguished by four phases that are performed continually with dynamically-obtained data over the lifetime of the hazardous event. (1) Measurement: Distributed sensors provide dynamic measurements over a specified time horizon that will be used to reconstruct the initial conditions of the event. (2) Inversion: Driven by the sparse measurements, an inverse problem is solved to estimate the initial conditions for the equations governing the evolution of the hazard. (3) Prediction: Statistical analysis of the inversion results permits estimation of the uncertainty in the initial conditions, which is propagated into a prediction of the evolution of the hazard and its uncertainty. (4) Steering: Sensors are steered to new locations based on an effectivity index that incorporates sensitivities of the inversion with respect to sensor location, estimated uncertainty in the prediction, and population density factors. Continual application of the measure-invert-predict-steer (MIPS) framework described above results in updated predictions of the evolving hazard with built-in uncertainty estimates, as well as revised sensor deployment strategies that refine the predictions to reduce their uncertainty. The methods developed consider two time scales of decision making at which the MIPS framework must execute. The seconds-to-minutes decision-making scale is required by first responders to begin immediate response efforts. For such time scales, high-fidelity models in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) are too formidable. Instead, the proposed methods will construct reduced-order models of the PDEs to facilitate realtime execution of the MIPS framework. The minutes-to-hours decision-making scale permits more careful and measured response by emergency officials using high-fidelity, high-resolution PDE models. To enable rapid execution of the MIPS cycle for such models, the project will develop fast, scalable, parallel algorithms for inversion and prediction. To demonstrate, assess, harden, robustify, and the resulting framework, will be validated on a specific application testbed: prediction of the urban/regional dispersion of intentionally- or accidentally-released atmospheric contaminants from sparse measurements."

The PC became the<br/>user interface for controlling the microscope hardware and for displaying slide images in a live<br/>preview window via a video camera.

These activities will require integrated networks of instruments, sensors, robots, and vehicles to cooperate forming a ""digital ocean."" Underwater communication via propagating acoustic signals holds the best promise for reliable and general purpose wireless communications in the ocean. Significant advances have been made in recent years to establish physical layer point-to-point links in many types of ocean environments. Yet, the development of higher layer techniques suitable for the challenging characteristics of the ocean environment remains largely unexplored territory. Networking the ""digital ocean"" via underwater acoustic communications remains one of the formidable technical obstacles to the a fully networked ocean. Challenges to be overcome by underwater acoustic modem and network designers include: severely limited range-dependent bandwidth and attenuation, extensive time-varying multipath propagation, and low speed of sound propagation in water resulting in long propagation delays. For sensor network deployment, these features imply that asynchronous and adaptive networking must be considered, typical medium access control will not be feasible, deterministic algorithms may not be feasible due to the stochastic nature of underwater networks, and link quality prediction and estimation will be paramount to delivering the desired quality of service. Finally, distance-dependent bandwidth implies that everything from capacity analysis to medium access control must be redeveloped under these new constraints. Terrestrial sensor networks are typically distinguished by high node density, large amounts of potentially correlated sensed data, stringent limitations on system resources, and multiple sources of uncertainty. Underwater sensor networks have even stronger limitations. To achieve the goals of an undersea sensor network, the PIs propose to study the following: network topology optimization and estimation, channel & energy-aware routing, delay/disruption tolerant underwater networking, cross-layer designs which integrate underwater channel characteristics, impact of the underwater acoustic channel on scaling laws and fundamental limits, experimental validation of system concepts for underwater acoustic networking"

The central objective of this interdisciplinary award is to bring the video monitoring capability to wireless sensor networks so as to collect important visual information for wildlife behavior analysis and interaction modeling. The overall goal of the research is to develop a long-lived and unobtrusive wildlife video monitoring system capable of real-time video streaming with remote control capability. The captured video in real time will be transmitted over wireless sensor networks to a remote monitoring center for real-time viewing and camera control. Because real-time transmission requirements are particularly challenging to wireless sensor network design, the research will address important issues on energy minimization and performance optimization in video sensing over mobile wireless sensor networks. The PIs will engineer a portable, low-energy, rugged, wireless network video/GPS/motion sensor coupled with an optimized transmission protocols and routing schemes for transferring the video images through sensor node design, access control, and robust routing protocol. Deer-net is a highly innovative interdisciplinary engineering, computer science, and wildlife science project in the field of cognitive ecology. The video monitoring has the potential to significantly advance this area of science and engineering and has broader application to other fields including surveillance, security, process monitoring, and other industrial applications. The broader impacts will arise from multi-disciplinary collaboration among computer scientists, engineers, and wildlife biologists; participation by students spanning undergraduate to doctoral levels; integration into ongoing courses; recruitment of under-represented groups; and educational opportunities for K-12 students to observe wildlife behavior."

The STUDENT-PARTNERS Project unites students, teachers, and scientists to study the role of rivers in the Arctic System and creates an innovative and effective education and outreach program. By partnering with K-12 grade students and teachers living beside the largest arctic rivers in Russia, Canada, and Alaska, researchers are able to obtain high frequency river water samples that are needed to understand hydrologic and biogeochemical fluxes in the river systems. In the process, a multinational arctic river observing network will be developed involving Russia, Canada and the U.S. Frequent and ongoing measurements of material flux in major arctic rivers are critical for investigating land-ocean linkage in the Arctic and for understanding the impact of climate change on the Arctic System; yet, no long-term project is investigating the major arctic rivers in a coordinated fashion. The six arctic rivers included in the Student PARTNERS project (Yenisey, Lena, Ob' in Russia,<br/>Mackenzie in Canada, Yukon and Colville in Alaska) together account for more than half of riverine freshwater entering the Arctic Ocean and their combined watershed area is greater than 11 million square kilometers. Therefore, data collected will provide an integrated view of biogeochemical and hydrological processes occurring over a huge area. Furthermore, the Student PARTNERS project is designed such that the multinational community-based arctic river observing network will be sustainable for the long-term. This is important because long-term observations will be needed to determine how arctic rivers are responding to climate change. Through involvement in sampling, sample analysis, and data interpretation, students and teachers at the study sites will come to appreciate the pivotal role ""their"" rivers play in the Arctic System. They will have frequent and ongoing interactions with project scientists and educators, thus becoming active participants in an international scientific endeavor. Inquiry will be stressed, and project content/concepts will be linked to the National Science Education Standards. At the same time, project scientists and educators will be responsive to needs of the local communities. Project assessment activities will define characteristics and approaches that lead to successful student-teacher-scientist partnerships. In this way, the project will add to the educational research base and provide a model that can be applied elsewhere.<br/>A great diversity of students and teachers will be involved in the Student PARTNERS project.

An indigenous curriculum developer will translate the science into culturally relevant science education materials that meet national standards. Through community presentations, media contacts, and the project web site, students and adults who live outside of the Arctic will also be exposed to the unique importance of the Arctic. An additional collaborator will develop an online teacher enhancement module that presents the research on arctic rivers as a current, globally relevant unit on geoscience education with hands-on curriculum materials for use in the classroom. This project truly integrates research with education where the students become the scientists collecting an unprecedented data set on the freshwater inputs of the Arctic Ocean."

It is also a key target of disease treatment, with several important drugs inhibiting the biosynthesis of DNS and RNA precursors (nucleotide metabolism). Recent advances in systems biology, analytical chemistry, and computer science provide the opportunity to begin construction quantitative, dynamic models of the integrated behavior of bionetworks like nucleotide metabolism. A major barrier to obtaining accurate dynamic models, however, lies in the difficulty of extracting the quantitative models from noisy experimental data, given nonlinear network behavior and the limited number of laboratory measurements. The proposed research aims to develop a closed-loop identification machine for molecular bionetworks (CLIMB) to enable reliable and cost-effective model identification through iterative rounds of computation and computation-guided experimentation. CLIMB involves two core computational components, (1) a control module which designs optimized chemical fluxes for application to the target network for the purpose of parameter identification, and (2) an inversion module which calculates feasible parameter values based on the experimental results. The features that distinguish CLIMB from traditional adaptive identification techniques include the utilization of a non linear, global inversion algorithm to extract the distribution of model parameters consistent with the experimental measurements, and the utilization of this parameter distribution in a nonlinear, closed-loop learning control algorithm to guide further experiments. The CLIMB technique will be fully developed and applied to achieve a quantitative understanding of the nucleotide metabolism of E. coli and S. cerevisiae. CLIMB-designed chemical influxes will be introduced to the nutrient-limited, steady-state cultures of living cells. The dynamic response of the metabolic network will be monitored by analyzing intracellular nucleotide content during and after application of the CLIMB-designed chemical flux. The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in applying iterative rounds of computation and experimentation to handle network identification challenges too difficult for classical approaches. It further lies in designing computational modules suitable for the real-world challenges of highly nonlinear networks and limited, noisy measurements. Finally, the effort will culminate in streamlined integration of computation with culture, collection, and metabolomic measurement of growing cells."

While much of the damage associated with hurricanes is related to wind and flooding, damage as a result of storm surge in coastal areas in particular can be significant, and this damage mechanism is very similar to what can happen during a tsunami. This is clearly the case for Katrina.<br/>Development of design guidelines for coastal construction to resist storm surge and tsunami wave loading has been hampered by the lack of experimental research and field data. Although excellent records are often collected of coastal run-up, either via field surveys or satellite imagery, the effects of storm surge and tsunami loading on the built infrastructure is often not well documented. To supplement our work under a recently-received NEES-R grant to develop Performance Based Tsunami Engineering (PBTE), we will survey the structural damage associated principally with storm surge and the resulting hydrodynamic forces on areas of the U.S. Gulf Coast.<br/>A significant amount of the damage to the Biloxi coast area appears to have resulted from the storm surge and waves. However, it appears that large engineered buildings withstood the storm surge and waves. Damage to these types of buildings appears to be primarily from debris, either water-borne or wind-borne. The former appears to have caused the most significant structural damage, including partial collapse of several large structures.<br/>A first hand assessment of the storm surge and debris impact damage from Katrina will help us to focus more clearly on the damage mechanisms that occur in both hurricane storm surge and tsunami conditions. We also anticipate that damage from unexpected sources will become evident. The survey represents a rare opportunity to document the damage in an industrialized country resulting from a tsunami-like event."

Highly stable, battery-powered miniature helicopters were used in the first days of the Hurricane Katrina response by the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR) to closely survey damage. These miniature helicopters have been outfitted with improved optics to better capture details of structural distress. The helicopters can enter or survey structures that may not be possible for engineers to reach due to the damage itself or lack of access (e.g., sitting in water or surrounded by debris), where entry may pose a significant risk to engineers, and supply viewpoints from interesting points of structural failure (e.g., close up of roofs from the outside, views from the side on the water). The Mississippi Gulf Coast has comparably few multi-story structures and CRASAR has extensive field experience so a rapid documentation effort is expected to be completed before important details are obscured by additional weather. All data are available to structural engineers, emergency response planners, and the general scientific community. The project has a secondary mission: refining the payloads and procedures needed to foster the adoption and effective use of helicopters by the larger engineering community. In addition to the fundamental science contributions, the project is expected to have significant broader impacts spanning the emergency response, civil and mechanical, insurance, and robotics communities."

However, different abilities to exploit resources (e.g., different morphologies) may foster coexistence and enhance local diversity. Differences among species may pre-exist or may arise in contact with ecologi-cally similar species. The latter phenomenon, character displacement (CD), is a logical out-growth of competitive exclusion. Because of its potential for altering existing biological forms and generating new biological forms, CD is the most important and least understood ecologi-cal/evolutionary consequence of competition. In particular, its potential for structuring ecologi-cal communities and for enhancing local and regional biodiversity has not been thoroughly ex-plored. The research evaluates the role of CD in species coexistence and local species diversity arcoss heterogeneous landscapes. Focus of the project on mechanisms maintaining and generating species diversity is timely given society's vested interest in the maintenance of species diversity and its role in ecosystem function. Extensive field sampling and detailed mechanistic experiments are combined to examine CD in salamander species groups differing in numbers of species and spe-cies identity at local and regional scales across the S.

The classical algorithms work well when the number d of variables is small; however, they fail even for a modest number d since their costs increase exponentially with d. <br/><br/>This is why the research will concentrate on tractability of multivariate problems. This will include identifying important problems that are tractable and deriving efficient algorithms for such problems. For problems that are not tractable in the most commonly used worst-case setting, average-case and <br/>randomized settings will be used to study their complexity. This will allow to avoid the worst-case intractability by the expense of weaker (random or probabilistic) assurances of the errors. In <br/>such cases, efficient randomized algorithms will be proposed, i.e., algorithms that, with a large probability, yield very accurate solutions at small (polynomial in d) cost. <br/><br/>Recent observations by a number of researchers indicate that some important problems (e.g., in mathematical finance, physics, statistics, experimental design, etc.) have the so called small effective dimension. This is why a significant effort will be devoted to the complexity study of such problems and to constructions of polynomial-time algorithms. In summary, the research will enhance the understanding of the complexity of multivariate problems and their tractability.

In the area of planning under uncertainty, the Markov decision process (MDP) has emerged as a powerful and elegant framework for solving problems in a wide range of application domains such as mobile robot control, machine maintenance, gesture recognition, medical diagnosis and treatment, and policy making. For situations in which the decision maker can fully observe the intermediate state of the domain, there are many effective algorithms that can solve large problems. However, in many applications, it is unrealistic to assume that perfect state information is available. The more general, partially-observable MDP (POMDP) addresses this difficulty, but in this case the computational complexity of planning makes it hard to apply existing solution techniques to practical applications. <br/><br/>This project will study new ways to address the key computational bottlenecks in POMDP algorithms. To achieve this, it will (a) Identify and examine new types of belief-space structures that can be used to accelerate significantly each of the key components of POMDP solution techniques; (b) Evaluate the impact of these improvements on a wide range of exact and approximate algorithms with the goal of demonstrating exponential acceleration; (c) Integrate the new approach with previously identified methods for accelerating MDP and POMDP algorithms using search, symbolic representations, and parallelization; (d) Develop a new set of challenging test problems and benchmarks that are significantly harder than the existing toy problems and perform a rigorous evaluation and comparison of the developed techniques; and (e) Increase the interaction between the artificial intelligence community and other communities that employ POMDP solution techniques such as operations research and management sciences, and exploit the synergy that arises when the best solution techniques from these communities are brought together. <br/><br/>The approach is based on exploring new types of structures in the belief space that make it possible to decompose the main computational components into faster, region-based operations. A theoretical analysis of the new approach and a preliminary implementation show that it can significantly increase the efficiency of both exact and approximate algorithms and thus it can improve the scalability of POMDP algorithms and increase their applicability. The newly designed technique is particularly suitable for parallel implementation on grid computers, offering significant additional opportunities for performance gains. <br/><br/>The technical impact of this project involves fundamental contributions to the understanding of the complexity of planning in stochastic domains as well as the development of efficient planning algorithms that provide exponential savings in computing time. The new approach improves several computational operations that are often used as components of existing algorithms - both exact and approximate. Therefore, the benefits of the approach transfer easily to many existing solution techniques. The broader impact of the project stems from the broad applicability of the resulting technology in several scientific and engineering disciplines, the immediate educational impact at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, an extensive plan for non-traditional dissemination efforts, making the experimental testbed available to the research community, and enhancing an existing alliance between the principal investigator and an international research team at INRIA, France."

These systems integrate renewable and phase change materials (PCMs) to significantly reduce peak heat transfer rates across walls and ceilings, shift peak cooling loads, and reduce energy use in residential and small commercial buildings. In this project, the building thermal insulation represents the carrier and holder of the PCMs, which are integrated into the insulation during its manufacturing process. This integration is made possible through innovative encapsulation techniques and reformulated fire-retardant mixtures. <br/><br/> Research in this area is important because the energy spent annually to power space heating and cooling systems in buildings in the U.S. represents about 20% of the annual energy consumed in the country. Therefore, improvements that increase the energy efficiency of building elements (walls, ceilings, floors) are greatly needed. These improvements will reduce energy resource use and ultimately decrease emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, this represents an important step in the development of low-energy buildings and significantly extends current practices by integrating low-temperature energy distribution into the manufacture of high-efficiency wall and ceiling components.

How do parenting and parent-child relationships change when children become teenagers? Can parents remain aware of their children's whereabouts, activities, and friends as the children move from elementary school into and through middle school? Is intrusive parenting avoidable during early adolescence? Will working to maintain a positive relationship with their children help parents remain aware and avoid becoming intrusive? Dr. Robert Laird seeks answers to these and other questions in his research funded by the National Science Foundation. Parents' awareness of their teenagers' whereabouts and activities protects children from many problem behaviors and outcomes including violence and delinquency; drug, tobacco, and alcohol use; early initiation of sexual intercourse and risky sexual behavior; and poor school performance. On the other hand, when parents frequently rely on psychological intrusion and manipulation to control their children, the children are more likely to experience anxiety and depression and to engage in aggressive and delinquent behavior. Dr. Laird seeks to understand how parents' awareness and interactions with their children change as children become teenagers. Parents report being more nervous and apprehensive about adolescence than any other period in their child's life but little is known about how parenting or parent-child relationships change when children become teenagers. Dr. Laird's research team will interview a group of 200 mother-child dyads once a year for three years beginning the summer after the child completes fifth grade. Dr. Laird will focus on identifying change in parents' awareness and intrusiveness and will attempt to connect these changes with developmental changes in the child such as growing older and going through puberty; aspects of the parent-child relationship such as conflict, communication, and trust; and parents' own feelings of confidence, depression, and hostility.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the project are derived from Dr. Laird's extensive focus on processes through which adolescents influence and determine the parenting they receive. The broader impacts of the study include information for parents, interventionists, and therapists on how the transition from childhood to adolescence influences parenting and parent-child relationships, and how such parenting and relationships may influence the development of adolescent behavior problems. This project also integrates research and education by providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in research."

It specifically addresses how variations in melting of upwelling mantle affect the composition of primary magmas and how these magmas are changed in chemistry and mineralogy by cooling and crystallization at different depths in the crust and mantle. This research combines theoretical models, geophysical constraints on the thickness of the crust, and chemical and petrographic analyses of natural samples from the Galapagos Spreading Center and Icelandic Western Volcanic Zone mid-ocean ridges. These contrasting sample sets will allow evaluation how variations in spreading rate, mantle source composition, mantle temperature, crustal thickness and variations in eruptive style create physical and chemical variations in mid-ocean ridge lavas at specific locations along spreading ridges. The work involves determining the relative proportions of individual minerals (olivine, feldspar, pyroxene and oxide) in selected samples and analyzing for the chemical compositions of these minerals as well as of whole-rock samples. Specific sample sets include: (1) unusual submarine lavas from the Galapagos area with very high aluminum contents; (2) at least two other sample sets from the Galapagos area that represent samples with varying distance from the mantle anomaly that is responsible for the Galapagos archipelago; and (3) Two eruptive units close in age and location from the subaerial mid-ocean ridge exposed in Iceland. The Icelandic work will investigate samples erupted at different times during single eruption episodes, which will allow us to address eruptive processes in ways not possible in the Galapagos area. It also permits investigation of variations in mantle sources, melting conditions and magma evolution processes over short spatial (~20 km) and temporal (~400 years) scales.<br/>Broader Impacts: This work supports a faculty member and graduate student at the University of Hawaii. Student training will include a wide range of analytical and petrological techniques and theory, as well as an introduction to Icelandic geology. Undergraduate students will be involved in the preparation of rock samples for chemical and petrographic analysis. Results of this research will be incorporated into classroom teaching and community presentations and published in widely accessible peer-reviewed journal articles."

How well these communities can adapt is both constrained and facilitated by engagement in local and global social, political, and economic networks. Understanding the complexity of these interactions is critical to the effective management of human response to change in the subarctic and elsewhere. This research project will bring together an interdisciplinary team of American, Japanese, and Russian scholars and students to examine the 5,000-year history of human-environmental interactions along the Kuril Island chain in the northwest Pacific. Evidence of human colonization, persistence and abandonment at various times in the past five millennia and under different social, economic, and technological regimes will be used to study human vulnerability and resilience to both catastrophic and gradual environmental changes, including human-induced changes. The project's primary objectives include (1) understanding feedbacks among climate, sea ice, marine and terrestrial ecology, and human activity; (2) estimating the degree of human vulnerability to catastrophic events and their ecological consequences at different spatial and temporal scales; and (3) assessing the role of cultural variables both in influencing community survival and affecting environmental changes. These objectives will be tackled through an ecologically integrated study of archaeological and historic records of human settlement and abandonment; geologic evidence of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis; paleoecologic and oceanographic evidence of past vegetation and marine conditions; and climatological evidence of past temperature, sea ice, and storminess. Evidence collected in the field over three summers will be used to test and calibrate agent-based computer models and simulations. Numerical models will be run to detect the most critical social, ecological, and physical variables affecting human resilience and vulnerability. The project will include education and outreach partnerships with indigenous Ainu communities in Hokkaido, Japan; the development of secondary school education kits and interactive computer simulations through the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture at the University of Washington; and the participation of undergraduate and graduate students throughout the project.<br/><br/>This study will make significant contributions to understanding the complexity of coupled human and natural systems. The research will advance the theory of human ecological dynamics and of the ways social and technological variables buffer or aggravate human vulnerability to unpredictable ecological changes and catastrophic events. This project will develop new modeling tools to facilitate interdisciplinary integration and understanding. It will provide models that can be adapted to other contexts and modern conditions where coastal communities appear particularly vulnerable to environmental and social factors beyond their control. More generally, this research will provide tools in the form of model prototypes that can be adapted to many different regions where human-environmental dynamics are complex. This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems."

This system would lay a foundation for highly optimized implementations of fundamental signal and imaging processing computations that arise in many science and engineering problems, including image recognition, communications analysis, speech processing, querying, indexing, and retrieval from multimedia databases, and image segmentation of aerial, satellite, and astronomical images. The proposed multidisciplinary approach optimizes from algorithm specification, to mathematical representation, to software and hardware (FPGA) implementation, based on properties of data and unique requirements of <br/>the environment and the target hardware device. <br/>The novelty of the system is twofold: (1) it performs joint optimization<br/>across mathematical, software and hardware (system-on-a-chip FPGA) domains; and, (2) it is a dynamic, data-driven system in that signal-processing transforms are tailored to algorithm requirements and input signals, for reduced distortion and increased compression, and the system can be queried and steered during execution. Implementations are based on the best mathematical formulation of the problem coupled with automated selection of the best implementation among a space of alternatives, through the integration of models relating mathematical properties to implementation<br/>behavior. Both hardware and software optimization are treated in a unified way. It is anticipated that with these methods the design-time will be decreased by two orders of magnitude or more, compared to implementations derived in a traditional way. Because the proposed system can explore a broad range of implementations that exceed the capabilities of a human designer, the implementations derived by the approach pursued in the project may even exhibit lower resource costs and higher performance. This research will provide a foundation for signal processing at all scales, providing key building blocks for engineers to build complex, distributed networks of adaptive signal processing sensors."

But two major sociological theories of identity- affect control theory and identity control theory- make diametrically opposing predictions about how people respond to over-reward. This project will examine two main questions: (1) How do people feel when they are treated better than they feel they deserve? (2) What is the relationship between feeling and action in these situations of over-reward? The PIs will use innovative physiological measures to resolve this theoretical controversy in the sociological literature. This research will offer a new understanding of the relationship between identity, injustice, and emotion, while developing new measurement techniques to better distinguish the theoretical constructs of emotion and identity disconfirmation. The researchers hypothesize that emotional response to injustice is more related to identity than to justice itself. It is only when one thinks that one is being a bad person by being over-rewarded- getting ahead at someone else's expense and with their knowledge- that over-reward makes one feel bad. Over-reward will lead to negative emotion only when it creates a negative identity. Otherwise, the experience of receiving more than one deserves will disconfirm the pre-existing identity in a positive direction, and produce positive emotion. An interesting, counter-intuitive prediction of affect control theory is that even though over-rewarded participants will feel good, they will act to reduce the over-reward in future rounds of the experiments. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research has broader implications for work settings, political policy discussions and for understanding social movement. They will specify the conditions that lead to behavioral remedy for injustice, and the occasions in which other mechanisms are likely to be available for resolving any stress that results from over-reward. Since those who are under-rewarded are often not well positioned to help themselves gain more resources, the reactions of the over-rewarded are key to addressing many forms of injustice."

Raghav<br/><br/><br/>Although a large research effort has been directed toward improving Anti/Counter-Terrorism (ACT) authorities' internal efficiency and interoperability, only a handful of studies have looked at citizens as an integral part of ACT services. The proposed research takes a citizen-centric perspective and is geared toward enhanced e-government services that help citizens prepare and protect themselves from terrorist attacks. This study proposes to survey citizens to understand Internet-based ACT government service use. Specifically, three categories of usage behaviors or behavioral intentions (i.e., get news, provide public leads, and follow directions) will be analyzed using an analytical framework that decomposes the behaviors/intentions into three, interlinked cognitive/decision processes; risk perception, channel choice decision, and source choice decision. Building on previous human behavior and innovation diffusion research in the MIS field, the study will examine the impacts of various social, technological, and personal factors on the cognitive/decision processes. The study will administer a questionnaire survey to two groups: systematically sampled US citizens and ACT service subscribers of a partnering organization (an Internet-based ACT service provider- Terrorism Research Center (www.terrorism.com)). The<br/>resulting model will be able to provide answers to such questions as ""why are some citizens indifferent to ACT services?"", ""how can the US government improve citizen-to-government ACT information flow using e-Gov facilities?"", ""why do some citizens prefer ACT services provided through traditional channels to those provided through the Internet?"", and ""why do some citizens prefer Internet-based ACT services provided by a non-government organization to those provided by a government authority?""  In addition to the timeliness of this research activity, an innovative aspect is that the research model will take into account an inherent duality: an e-gov service is perceived in some instances as an instrument of service and in others as an instrument of compliance. The model will also examine citizens' fear, privacy, and trust in relation to the role of the ACT service provider: protector, controller, or both.<br/><br/>This project will benefit ACT authorities by providing more and better public intelligence and benefit citizens by helping understand the key to well thought, higher quality ACT e-Gov<br/>services. The findings will be made available to the research community in the form of journal/conference papers.  Results will be also incorporated into classes taught at UB. The<br/>proposed research framework encompasses the three basic levels of e-governance: information,<br/>communication and participation, which makes it also applicable to a wide range of situations of public emergency, such as epidemic outbreaks, earthquakes, oil/chemical spills, etc., which may have a significant impact on the economic and psychological well-being of the Citizen.<br/>"

Training new scientists requires a strong emphasis on creating a student-learning environment that focuses on research-based exercises. This project integrates research-based teaching into the biochemistry laboratory sequence, enhancing the training of several groups of science majors and utilizing contemporary methods, such as liquid chromatography and spectrophotometry. Course materials for two semesters of biochemistry laboratories are being adapted from the biochemical education literature and modified so that the components of experimental design and data analysis are gradually transferred to the students over the first semester of the course. Then, in the second semester, the students are immersed in a research-based environment. The first semester focuses on using a single protein in the context of a semester-long research project to motivate student learning. In the second semester students are empowered to design, execute and analyze their experiments. Both semesters result in training students in the use of sophisticated instrumentation for data acquisition and analysis while utilizing advanced web-based technology including video and audio streaming of instructional materials. The progress of the program is being assessed through several mixed-method evaluations. A biochemistry education specialist is making additional assessments. Project outcomes are being disseminated at regional and national professional meetings and through development of a dedicated web site."

The instrument will also have multiple methods of detection of both electronic state and vibrational bond information for single-molecule identification. The microscope's ability to image in solution with these capabilities will be unique. The microscope will image the fluorescence from almost any visible chromophore without changing filters or excitation wavelength, an aspect that will dramatically simplify the optical system. This proposed instrument will improve upon the nominal >75 nm resolution limit of today's NSOMs to a level that will allow identification of individual closely packed proteins in a biologically friendly environment. <br/><br/>The versatility of the instrument will permit analyzing more than the biological samples described within this proposal. Prototypes built by the PI and collaborators have imaged carbon single walled nanotubes (SWNT) as well as novel polymer systems at sub 25 nm spatial optical resolutions. The proposed instrument can easily be adapted for use in materials science for analyzing structures of semiconductor wires and other inorganic 1-D and 2-D materials on the nanoscale, as well as signal detection improvement schemes for nanometrology.<br/><br/>In the process of development, the proposed instrument will have the added benefit of bringing together researchers in mathematics (modeling), biology, physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering. The broad understanding necessary to develop cutting edge NSOM instrumentation will benefit students as well by teaching them very strong technical skills, cross-disciplinary training, and the ability to bring different fields together to answer important scientific questions. After completion this microscope will be available to answer other biological and materials research questions, and there will be commercial possibilities."

To increase our understanding of the function of specific genes and expand our understanding of Arabidopsis, we need software that enables the analysis of disparate data types in the context of known information about metabolic networks. This project will enhance pilot-versions of three new publicly available, open source software tools. The MetNet platform will feature graph visualization and modeling, interactive displays, powerful graph-theoretic computations for determining biological distances (FCModeler), a unique multivariate display and analysis tool with functionality to do statistical analyses (GeneGobi), graph modeling using the open source statistical analysis language, R, and versatile text mining (PathBinderA). It will also enhance the database of metabolic and regulatory networks in Arabidopsis to expand the pathway information and make it web-accessible. These tools will be able to place experimental data in the context of metabolic and developmental networks to propose new insights about Arabidopsis gene function. The software will be evaluated and validated on a test case, the oxidative stress network in Arabidopsis, as a proof of concept. MetNet software will contribute to the research community's open source software toolbox. Workshops will be conducted on how to analyze complex data sets using MetNet.

Among the most important changes and those best reflected in the fossil record involved the shape of the head, related to language, diet, defense, threat, olfaction, intelligence, vision, and posture. These include shortening the face and tucking it under the braincase, smaller teeth (especially canines), increased brain size, and reorientation of the cranial base. Our knowledge of the evolution of these traits will remain limited until we understand their underlying biological, and in particular, genetic bases. <br/>The purpose of this pilot project is to identify genetic factors underlying the nature and timing of changes in skull shape during the evolution of humans, apes, and Old World monkeys. A combined strategy will: (1) identify the dimensions of natural craniofacial development, variation and evolution from living and fossil primate skulls, (2) identify genes that in baboons and mice are associated with variation in those dimensions, and (3) experimentally confirm that these genes are appropriately expressed during craniofacial developmental networks that may be responsible for evolution of craniofacial shape within and between species. <br/>3D reconstructions of a set of computed X-ray tomography (CT) scans acquired from a set of fossil African papionin skulls will be analyzed quantitatively to identify single and multivariate axes of craniofacial variation. These results will be coupled with observations from the literature to identify features of craniofacial variation that were important in the evolution of these animals. Similar CT scans will be obtained from approximately 250 baboon skulls in a large, known genealogy at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research (SFBR), that have been genotyped for about 350 microsatellite markers across the genome. Linkage mapping will be done to identify chromosomal regions in the baboons that affect these axes of variation. Mice and primates share the basic processes of skeletal development, so the mouse is a phenotypic and genetic model for identifying these processes, and two gene mapping approaches will be taken to do that. Chromosomal regions identified by mapping in the mouse and baboon will be tested experimentally by examining gene expression and DNA sequence changes in coding or regulatory regions that affect the axes of craniofacial change that were identified from the CT scans. <br/> This is an integrated developmental evolutionary approach to understand the genetic elements of craniofacial variation. Current phylogenetic approaches use craniofacial features in the absence of knowledge of their genetic basis. One consequence is that we cannot discriminate between change due to common genetic determination and adaptive convergence and this has led to inconsistencies between molecular and morphologically based phylogenies. The identification of developmental genetic pathways will provide tests of the homology of such traits. <br/> Intellectual Merit -- The general problems and approaches to the developmental genetics of complex metric traits are of widespread interest to biologists of all types because similar problems and processes are widespread in nature.<br/> Broader Impact -- The researchers will create a major archive of 3D CT images of baboon skulls, genetic materials, and quantitative methods, and make them available to other investigators. This project involves several institutions here and abroad, and will include undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students.

All five universities are among the nation's leaders in awarding PhDs in the SBE fields to underrepresented minority students. The plan for the AC-SBE Alliance includes elements designed to help students at each step as they move from undergraduate school into graduate programs and onto the professoriate. The consortium has four objectives: (1) Recruit and prepare undergraduates to pursue a PhD in SBE fields, (2) Assist students in the transition from undergraduate to graduate study, (3) Retain PhD students and increase degree completion rates, and (4) Prepare future SBE faculty for success. Although each of the five schools in the AC-SBE alliance has unique features, the AC-SBE Alliance will include a number of overarching activities that will involve all five universities. For one example, the Alliance will build upon Howard University's Summer Institute that prepares future faculty in the STEM disciplines to launch a parallel SBE component. Also, entering AC-SBE students will be invited to participate in a one-week course Introduction to Data Analysis for the Social Sciences at the Odum Institute for Research in the Social Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Odum Institute will also offer a number of videoconference short courses for AC-SBE students. Efforts will be made to ensure that the students in the SBE Alliance have further opportunities to interact and network at conferences such as the NSF-supported EMERGE. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Through integrating the resources of the five AC-SBE Alliance institutions, AC-SBE will have a broad impact across a wide region of the country in the eventual production of SBE PhD recipients. Thus, AC-SBE will serve as a comprehensive project for recruiting, mentoring, and graduating URM students in SBE PhD programs, and to carry out strategies to identify and broadly support URM students who want to pursue graduate studies and academic careers. The norms of inclusiveness at the AC-SBE Alliance institutions and the relationships that have been forged will endure well past the termination of grant support to continue efforts to ensure the significant numbers of minority students pursue and receive PhD degrees and enter the professoriate."

It is concerned with three core questions of social dynamics: How are practices of privacy and identity changing, what new patterns are evolving, and how is the relationship between technical and social being developed? The research will address these questions through ethnographic studies focused on two emerging areas - ""blogging"" and communication through mobile technologies - in which new practices surrounding privacy and identity are being developed. The results of this investigation will provide designers and policy-makers with a framework for understanding the mutual evolution of technology and practice in the areas of privacy and identity management.<br/><br/>Information technology is a key agent of change in contemporary society, and yet our understandings of technology, its shaping, and its impacts are typically fragmented. From an engineering perspective, IT is studied as a technological artifact and measured against predetermined goals; from a social or cultural perspective, it is often treated as a ""black box"" with little consideration of its nature and detail. This research project aims to address this balance, by bringing together an interdisciplinary group to study a critical nexus of information technology and society - the ways in which information practices in social groups serve to maintain boundaries of membership and information flow.<br/><br/>The intellectual approach of this project is based on five fundamental principles. The first is that information technology is a site of social and cultural production. The second is that technology reinscribes prior social and power structures. The third is that ""public"" and ""private"" are not rigidly dichotomous. The fourth is that rather than being seen in purely economic or informational terms, privacy should be approached as collective information practice. The fifth is that information practices are a means of identity work.<br/><br/>The increasing colonization of everyday life by information technology has major implications for society at large, and this is particularly true for the rise of mobile networked systems. Indeed, concerns over information privacy and security are topics of national and international deliberation. This research will provide individuals and policy-makers with tools to tackle these problems, and technologists with a deeper understanding of the relationship between technical and social in the systems that they develop. More immediately, this interdisciplinary partnership of social scientists and technologists is part of a developing program in interdisciplinary studies of information technology which draw not only on engineering but also on social science, arts, and humanities in order to form a holistic picture of technology and everyday life. By bringing different perspectives together on a problem of clear societal importance, this research will provide a means to integrate both graduate and undergraduate teaching across traditional disciplinary boundaries, building on existing bridges within curricula."

This problem has important implications for the dynamics of large scale mantle convection and plate tectonics as well as the geochemical evolution of the planet. Magma migration is also an intrinsically interesting problem in coupled fluid/solid mechanics as it requires understanding the non-linear interactions of low viscosity reactive fluids in a strongly deformable <br/>and permeable matrix. For the past 20 years, the predominant theory for magma migration in the mantle has been a system of mathematical models (partial differential equations or PDEs), which describe the evolution of macroscopic quantities, e.g. the porosity or proportion of molten rock at a given position and time. These equations have proved useful for exploring the behavior of magmatic systems through both simplified model problems and more complex geoscience specific applications. However, more recent experimental work suggests that there exist some important quantitative discrepancies between the experiments and predictions of these models. In particular, these models become singular as the porosity becomes small. These and other results suggest that a modeling and mathematical understanding of the behavior of the current equations is necessary to gauge the utility of these models and to develop improved mathematical descriptions (e.g. by introducing physically reasonable regularizations) for partially molten regions in large scale mantle dynamics. The purpose of this proposal is to combine expertise in the analysis of non-linear PDE's with the physics and computation of magma dynamics to develop better insight and better models for complex coupled fluid/solid systems. This work is collaborative effort between Michael I. Weinstein (Columbia Applied Mathematics) and Marc Spiegelman (Columbia Joint appointment between Earth and Env. Sciences and Applied Math) and will be the primary Ph. D. research of Gideon Simpson who is jointly supervised by Weinstein and Spiegelman. This project will attack two separate problems that arise at different scales in partially molten regions. At large scales, variations in porosity can propagate as dispersive non-linear waves with a poorly understood non-linear dispersion term. At smaller scales, laboratory experiments demonstrate that shear deformation of the solid matrix can drive localization of melt-rich bands We will consider a series of analytic and numerical model problems to develop a better understanding of the current models as well as exploring ways to improve the formulation. <br/><br/>This project will form the primary source of funding for a promising graduate student (Gideon Simpson) to work at the intersection of Applied Mathematics and Earth Science. This work should also have general applications in science and engineering to problems involving the flow of fluids in permeable deformable solids such as those arising in petroleum engineering, hydrology and nuclear/toxic waste confinement."

It features a new theoretical basis for three-dimensional, numerical ocean models conjoined with surface wave models. Nevertheless, additional empirical rules such as those extant in turbulence closure schemes and prominent in the modeling of surface boundary layers are needed. The marriage of surface layer (or mixed layer) models and surface wave models poses new questions and requires new thinking and data. It is expected that many of the unknowns can be addressed by detailed measurements only available in a laboratory setting as described below, thence on to available field data. First, a circulation model for mean properties dependent on one horizontal and one vertical dimension (essentially a channel or wave tank flow) will be set up together with a surface wave model. The model will encompass Stokes drift, vertically dependent wave radiation stress terms and other processes and will require a new critical look at means of representing turbulence mixing. There will be a need to distinguish between total momentum input from wind and that portion which contributes to wave buildup or wave decay. Bottom boundary layer - wave interaction will also be a component of the overall model.<br/><br/>The laboratory experiments will be designed to test critical aspects of the model, in particular those processes that involve interactions between wave induced motions and turbulent flow. The existing laboratory tank and measuring equipment is well suited to examine: a) the characteristics of mechanical (paddle) or wind-generated waves; b) turbulent flow in a 2-D slice, usually a plane normal to the cross-tank axis, c) fine scale structure of the turbulence including direct estimates of the rate of kinetic energy dissipation; d) turbulent velocities and pressure above the surface and estimates of the momentum transfer from wind to waves; e) methods of separating the flow variables into their mean, wave-related and turbulent parts.<br/><br/>The anticipated results of this research will be a combined three-dimensional, current-wave-turbulence model which includes sub-models for wind forcing, surface wave breaking, bottom friction and other empirical ingredients supported by data obtained from the proposed experiments and data available in the oceanographic literature. The model will be a precursor to wave dependent air/sea transfer of climate relevant gases.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts : This new model will have many broader impacts within the research community. The Princeton Ocean Model developed by Dr. Mellor and colleagues has been applied worldwide to understand the dynamics of many diverse oceanographic systems. The development of advanced community models such as those proposed here that deal with wave dynamics and the interactions of waves and turbulence, are essential building blocks for fully coupled atmosphere-interface-ocean models. Such models are necessary for understanding and predicting such important environmental processes as: pathways and accumulation of anthropogenic pollutants, climate change and the spread or extinction of marine species. The results from both the modeling and experimental components of this research will be available at a dedicated web site. This will provide the broader community with up-to date information on the progress of the research. Final results will be disseminated through refereed publications as the extensive track record of the investigators demonstrates. Additional impacts of the research will be through graduate student support and the improved capabilities of the Air-Sea Interaction Salt-water Tank (ASIST) facility at the University of Miami. ASIST is an excellent tool for instruction in wind-wave-current interaction at all levels. A laboratory course that demonstrates basic principles of wave theory and boundary layer turbulence has been developed at the University of Miami. The facility has also sponsored summer internships from several institutions including the French Naval Academy and the University of Toulon. Given the success of these projects we expect to continue to provide internship opportunities. Community outreach has been a significant ongoing activity at ASIST. Many campus and community groups will continue to be introduced to wind/wave interaction studies through tours of the facility."

This requires dynamic integration of time-varying measurements of flow, pressure and contaminant concentration with analytical modules including models to simulate the state of the system, statistical methods for adaptive sampling, and optimization methods to search for efficient control strategies. For realistic distribution systems, the analytical modules are highly compute-intensive, requiring multi-level parallel processing via computer clusters. While data often drive the analytical modules, data needs for improving the accuracy and certainty of the solutions generated by these modules dynamically change when a contamination event unfolds. Since such time-sensitive threat events require real-time responses, the computational needs must also be adaptively matched with available resources. Thus, a software system is needed to facilitate this integration via a high-performance computing architecture (e.g., the TeraGrid) such that the measurement system, the analytical modules and the computing resources can mutually adapt and steer each other. The goal of this multi-disciplinary research is to develop a cyberinfrastructure system that will both adapt to and control changing needs in data, models, computer resources and management choices facilitated by a dynamic workflow design. Using virtual simulation and a field study, this cyberinfrastructure will be tested on illustrative scenarios for adaptive management of contamination events in water distribution systems.<br/><br/>Urban water distribution systems are vulnerable to accidental and intentional contamination incidents that could result in adverse human health and safety impacts. The pipe network in a typical municipal distribution system includes redundant flow paths to ensure service when parts of the network are unavailable, and is designed with significant storage to deliver water during daily peak demand periods. Thus, a typical network is highly interconnected and experiences significant and frequent fluctuations in flows and transport paths. These design features unintentionally enable contamination at a single point in the system to spread rapidly via different pathways through the network, unbeknown to consumers and operators. When a contamination event is detected via the first line of defense, e.g., data from a water quality surveillance sensor network and reports from consumers, the municipal authorities are faced with several critical questions as the contamination event unfolds: Where is the source of contamination? When and for how long did this contamination occur? Where additional hydraulic or water quality measurements should be taken to pinpoint the source more accurately? What is the current and near future extent of contamination? What response action, such as shutting down portions of the network, implementing hydraulic control strategies, or introducing decontaminants, should be taken to minimize the impact of the contamination event? What would be the impact on consumers by these actions? Real-time answers to such complex questions will present significant computational challenges. This project will address these challenges by developing an adaptive cyberinfrastucture that will enable real-time processing and control through dynamic integration of computational components and real-time sensor data. This system will be evaluated using contamination scenarios based on field-scale data from a large metropolitan area."

The characteristics of prominent interannual and decadal climatic forcing mechanisms likely differed through time. Vast amounts of high-resolution documentary data from different colonial archives extending back several centuries have not yet been seriously utilized for paleo-hurricane reconstruction. This high-resolution source consists of records such as early instrumental records, ship logs, diaries, and newspapers. <br/><br/>The researchers will launch a comprehensive effort to reconstruct Atlantic Basin tropical cyclone activity, at daily to sub-daily resolution, from the eighteenth century to:<br/><br/>1) reconstruct annual counts and tracks of Atlantic Basin tropical cyclones from early newspapers, ship logbooks, diaries, and early instrumental records, with an emphasis on the period 1800-1850. <br/>2) reconstruct continuous time series of land falling tropical cyclones for selected locations that possess rich documentary records back to the mid 1700s. These locations are North Carolina, Georgia, North East Florida, Southern Louisiana, the Florida Panhandle, eastern Massachusetts, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. <br/>3) reconstruct the synoptic-scale circulation patterns for selected extreme active land falling years in the Atlantic Basin by examining all available instrumental, documentary, and colonial ship logbook archives over eastern North America and the western Atlantic. <br/>4) examine the relationships between the reconstructed tropical cyclone activity with forcing factors of climatic change. The researchers will examine how El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the thermohaline circulation affect tropical cyclone activity by integrating paleoclimatic reconstructions (e.g., from tree-rings, corals) with paleo-hurricane reconstructions. <br/><br/>The results of the research will be relevant to the interests of coastal zone scientists and planners, habitat restoration groups, land managers businesses concerned with managing risk, and coastal property owners in providing long-term historical climate analyses.

Although electrochemical recycling of cofactors has been regarded as a potentially useful approach, there is a clear obstacle in that only enzymes in the immediate vicinity of electrode surface are effectively involved. This exploratory research project will examine a highly innovative approach that uses an ""electronically-conductive"" sol-gel bioreactor for cofactor regeneration. By entrapping oxidoreductases in a conductive sol-gel hybrid matrix and by manipulating the chemical properties of the nanoporous gel, it is hypothesized that the cofactor will be efficiently recycled throughout the entire reactor system. This approach by the principle investigator shows acute insight into the key challenges in the regeneration process, but the project is clearly high risk because of the necessity of preparing a precise ""composite"" of conductive sol moiety/polypyrrole/graphite/metal particles for the sol-gel synthesis which would be based on silica-based sol precursors, such as trialkoxysilanes. The chemical composition of the gel precursors must be carefully correlated with knowledge of the in situ cofactor regeneration efficiency and the desired product yield. Successful demonstration of this approach, however, would likely revolutionize the applicability of electrochemical regeneration for biocatalysts. <br/><br/>The difficulty and expense of cofactor regeneration for oxidoreductases is a key roadblock for the wider syntheses of important valued-added products including pharmaceuticals, food additives, perfumes, insecticides, and pesticides. This approach would open an entirely new avenue of scientific investigation and would lead to new areas for fundamental research and engineering. Broader technological applications in the areas of biosensors and biofuel cells are also possible. Results from the research will be incorporated into upper-level chemical engineering coursework, which will be a significant contribution to the enhancement of the engineering curriculum."

In a first stage, the PIs plan to make a careful, stepwise study of the mathematical intricacies of the problem. They will construct appropriate wavelets or wavelet-like bases, and take advantage of the presently emerging understanding of how to characterize effectively data or structures that are sparse with respect to these bases. They expect that recent mathematical progress that shows simple, non-adaptive methods can give results comparable to fancier, adaptive techniques, at the cost of a logarithmic factor in the ""size"" of the problem, will help them in building a good approach in the next stage of the project, to attack first the direct, and then the inverse problem. In a second stage they hope to couple this with the ultrafast algorithms that are being developed by Gilbert, Muthukrishnan, Strauss and co-workers, and/or with the graph-diffusion technique and the associated multiresolution structure developed by Coifman, Laffont and Maggioni. The new techniques will be applied in ongoing global seismic tomography research projects as they are developed. Finally, they will develop the integral kernels for the inversion of seismic waveforms (as opposed to travel times) into a condensed wavelet basis. This is a crucial step in the partitioning of the three-dimensional problem of waveform tomography. It should allow them to split the (unmanageably) large and nonlinear inverse problem for N seismograms into N nonlinear optimization problems of manageable size. <br/><br/>In seismic tomography, geophysicists seek to obtain information about hidden features of the Earth from a mathematical study of seismic waves excited by earthquakes or explosions, and recorded by a network of seismographs. This is to some extent similar to the more familiar CAT-scan tomography, in which doctors seek information on the inside of the body of a patient by taking transmitted X-ray pictures from many angles. Problems of this nature are called ""inverse problems"". Another inverse problem is the deblurring of images; for this problem, the wavelet transform, a recently developed mathematical tool, has shown to be particularly well adapted when the object one seeks to ""reconstruct"" can have sharp boundaries between regions that are otherwise smooth. Structures inside the Earth, such as subducting ocean floors or phase transitions, can likewise have sharp boundaries, whereas other variations in the physical properties may be distributed more smoothly. Wavelet techniques may therefore be particularly useful in seismic tomography as well. However, it is impossible to just transpose the image deblurring techniques to seismic tomography, because of the typically much larger size and greater complexity of the geophysical inverse problems, in which data can not be collected on a nice rectangular grid and large gaps in station coverage usually exist. The whole project will combine cutting edge applied mathematical techniques with new developments in the young field of finite frequency seismic tomography. The PIs expect that this collaboration between geophysical and mathematical investigators will eventually lead to sharper and more accurate images of the Earth's deep structure."

The objective of this study is to theoretically account for and empirically document the socio-economic benefits of consanguineous unions that help to sustain these types of marriages. A collective model of intra-household allocation and assortative spousal matching motivates the empirical investigation. The model predicts that for spouses and their children, the economic benefits of consanguineous marriages should depend on spousal incomes, the autonomy of spousal income from parental income, and external distribution factors like the sex ratio, cultural gender norms, and marriage/divorce legislation. Using existing as well as yet-to-be-gathered data from four<br/>Bangladeshi communities, the project will (a) document the prevalence of consanguinity for a country for which such numbers currently do not exist, (b) quantify the trade-off between the biological risks and any possible socio-economic benefits (in terms of long-run outcomes for children) of consanguinity, (c) study decision-making in the marriage market, including the characteristics of potential spouses that families consider to be most attractive, and (d) investigate the creation of international migration links through marriage. <br/><br/>The dataset that will be produced will allow researchers in Economics, Sociology, Biology, Genetics and the Medical Sciences to study a variety of questions relating to intra-household decision-making, the nature of social networks, and the risk of genetic disorders stemming from consanguinity. The proposed research is a unique cross- and multidisciplinary approach to the question of trade-offs between the perceived social and economic benefits of consanguineous marriage as opposed to the recognized biological disadvantages. Bangladesh, a country of over 140 million is undergoing an epidemiological transition from a predominantly infectious to a non-communicable disease profile, is an ideal setting for the study, and the growing numbers of Bangladeshis now resident in Western countries add a significant new dimension to the work. Study findings are potentially generalizable to countries and societies currently undergoing transition from predominantly infectious to non-communicable disease profiles."

The goal of the proposed study is to determine the direct and/or indirect effects of environmental stressors, especially chemical pollutants and predators, on the transmission and spread of parasitic disease in amphibians. We are particularly interested in parasitic flatworms (trematodes), since these have been linked to debilitating deformities in frogs. Trematodes are also responsible for major diseases in humans, including schistosomiasis and echinostomiasis, diseases that afflict over 200 million people in tropical regions. We will focus on particular species of trematodes known to infect amphibians, including Ribeiroia ondatrae and Echinostoma trivolvis. These are transmitted from snails to amphibians and cause limb deformities and kidney damage respectively. This grant proposal is a collaborative effort with ecologist Jason Rohr et al. at Pennsylvania State University. Our main contribution will be to use immunological assays to investigate the effects of environmental stressors on the immune system in amphibians. An important component of the proposal is the opportunity for interaction among undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty at the two institutions."

This combined methodology, called Patent Cartography, will leverage multiple taxonomies, related terms, network analytics, visualization, and user interaction to navigate, explore, and map the patent space. <br/><br/>As the rate of patenting has increased, so too has the problem of patent thickets, or dense webs of overlapping intellectual property rights that an organization must hack its way through in order to commercialize new technology. In certain industries characterized by cumulative innovations and multiple blocking patents, the existence of such densely concentrated patent rights can have the perverse effect of stifling innovation rather than encouraging it. A recent Federal Trade Commission report notes that in certain industries, the large number of issued patents makes it virtually impossible to search all the potentially relevant patents, review the claims contained in each of those patents, and evaluate the infringement risk or the need for a license. For many firms the only practical response to this problem of unintentional and sometimes unavoidable patent infringement is to file hundreds of patents each year so as to have something to trade during cross-licensing negotiations. In other words, the only rational response to the large number of patents in a given field may be to contribute to it. <br/><br/>Given that 200,000 US patents are issued each year, with new patents issuing each week, any attempt to analyze and comprehend the dynamic topology and interconnectedness of patent space will almost certainly have to be based on information technology. The process of patent search, however, has not progressed very much even with the advent of searchable patent databases. Although automated, the patent search process itself has not been reengineered and thus remains functionally similar to the patent search process developed in the nineteenth century. <br/><br/>While end-users do not have the necessary tools to conduct exhaustive patent searches, professional patent searchers are overwhelmed with an ever increasing workload driven by an increased awareness of the importance of intellectual property. The need for effective end-user patent search capabilities will only increase over time, yet the traditional search process must be reengineered for that need to be met. <br/><br/>Using sets of existing professionally-generated patent searches, this project will compare end-user searches conducted with existing tools with other searches conducted with the new methodologies. Several different classes of end-users have been identified, with different levels of previous knowledge and experience with the patent system, and this project will compare the search results produced by each class of user with the professional patent search results. At the conclusion of the study, we will have not only a better understanding of the applicability of Patent Cartography and visualization techniques to the process of patent search, but also an understanding of the impact of familiarity and experience with the patent system in harnessing the potential of Patent Cartography. <br/><br/>This project will expand the boundaries of document retrieval beyond simple keyword and category search into multidimensional analysis combining mixed initiative data and text mining with visualizations. The project will also combine content and network analysis and evaluate visualizations based on both proximity and dependency data. Search processes and search strategies will also be examined in the context of large document collections. The project will also develop models of task-based information searching, which has been generally under-explored. Finally, the project will develop an ethnographic account of the patent search process by observing patent search experts. <br/><br/>This project will extend the scope of research on searching, analyzing, and visualizing large document collections. Patents are one exemplary form of large digital library repositories that contain both structured and unstructured data to which these techniques can be applied. Other sources include Medline, Research Abstracts, repositories of the World Wide Web, and other enterprise repositories. This search process could be leveraged in health care, life sciences, pharmaceuticals, market research, competitive intelligence, knowledge discovery, and tracking technology maturity and innovation to name just a few."

In this proposal, we focus on a class of observing systems which are (1) embedded into the environment, (2) consist of stationary and mobile sensors, and (3) react to collected observations by reconfiguring the system and adapting which observations are collected next, these are referred to as Reactive Observing Systems (ROS). The goal of ROS is to help scientists verify or falsify hypotheses with useful samples taken by the stationary and mobile units, as well as to analyze data autonomously to discover interesting trends or alarming conditions.<br/>A wide range of critical environmental monitoring objectives in resource management, environmental protection, and public health all require distributed observing systems. This project will explore ROS in the context of a marine biology application, where the system monitors, e.g., water temperature and light as well as concentrations of micro-organisms and algae in a body of water. Using a hybrid network of stationary and mobile sensors, communicating both via wired and wireless links, the system collects fine-grained measurements of interesting information in near real-time. An example of the use of such a system is the rapid identification of micro-organisms to predict the onset of algal blooms. Such blooms can have devastating economic consequences. <br/><br/>Current technology precludes sampling all possibly relevant data. Therefore there is need to develop approaches for optimizing and controlling the set of samples to be taken at any given time, taking into consideration the application's objectives and system resource constraints. To support such an optimization and control process, a significant part of the framework must be dedicated to the development of models of data, and their automatic validation or adaptation. As part of the validation and adaptation process, the framework must also include a distributed support mechanism for locating data of interest. The methods to be pursued in the project include a multi-scale modeling framework for ROS, that allows applications to construct inter-related models of varying spatio-temporal scope based on collected data. Guided by the models, the reactive elements of the system predict where interesting data and phenomena are likely to be found. In the process of constructing models, the system actively seeks most useful data to improve both, the models and phenomenon detection and tracking. In a feedback cycle, this data acquisition is guided by previous, perhaps less precise, models. Thus, the system to be developed (AMBROsia) enables optimal collection of measurements in a manner that respects system resource constraints, yet improves the overall fidelity of phenomenon detection and tracking. Such a system will aid scientific research by facilitating the testing of scientific hypothesis. It will provide timely predictions of sampling needs, and tracking information for dynamic phenomena. Overall, AMBROSia will facilitate observation, detection, and tracking of scientific phenomena that were previous only partially (or not at all) observable and/or understood."
0530709	NEESR-SG: Seismic Performance Assessment and Retrofit of Non-Ductile RC Frames with Infill Walls	CMMI	NEES RESEARCH	09/15/2005	06/30/2010	P. Benson Shing	CA	University of California-San Diego	Standard Grant	Joy Pauschke	08/31/2011	"$1,240,000.00"	Jose Restrepo	pshing@ucsd.edu	Office of Contract & Grant Admin	La Jolla	CA	920930621	8585344896	ENG	7396	"1057, 1576, 9102, CVIS"	$0.00	"ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Unreinforced masonry in fills are frequently found as interior partitions and exterior walls in buildings, and are normally treated as non-structural elements. However, unlike most non-structural components, they can develop a strong interaction with the bounding frames when subject to earthquake loads and, therefore, contribute significantly to the lateral stiffness and load resistance of the structure. In spite of the research that have spanned several decades, the performance of these structures in a severe earthquake remains a major controversy among structural engineers and researchers today. The main aim of the proposed research is to develop rational and reliable methodologies for assessing the seismic safety and performance of masonry unfilled RC frames, and develop practical and effective techniques for the seismic retrofit of these structures using conventional as well as innovative materials. The project will include the development of reliable analysis tools that range from advanced computational models to simple analytical methods that can be used in engineering practice. The project will take advantage of the vast computational resources and experimental facilities provided by NEES. The analysis methods and retrofit techniques will be first validated with medium-scale experiments to be<br/>conducted with the NEES Fast Hybrid Test facility at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Final proof-of-concept tests will be conducted on a 3/4-scale three-story RC frame using the NEES Large High Performance Outdoor Shake Table at the University of California at San Diego. Stanford University will focus on the development of sprayable high-performance fiber-reinforced cement-based composites for infill retrofit. The work will be carried out as a multi-institutional, inter-disciplinary effort by a diverse research team with expertise in professional practice, structural design, structural testing, structural analysis, computational mechanics, and composite materials. <br/><br/>Understanding and assessing the seismic performance of masonry-infilled non-ductile RC frames presents a most difficult problem in structural engineering. Currently, there are no reliable engineering guidelines for this. Analytical tools to evaluate the complicated frame-infill interaction and the resulting failure mechanisms need to be built on the fundamental principles of mechanics and sound engineering judgment. It is far more challenging than analyzing a pure RC or masonry structure. This research will fill a major gap in the modeling and performance assessment of this class of existing structures that can be frequently found in regions of high seismic risk and the development of effective retrofit strategies to prohibit the undesired failure mechanisms from a system perspective. The project will involve the development of new design and assessment techniques, new materials, and cutting-edge computational methods, which will be intellectually stimulating. <br/><br/>The leverage provided by the successful programs on education and outreach that are already in place at UCSD, CU, and Stanford, and the additional resources that will be secured outside NEES will reinforce the common education and outreach goals of NEESinc. The proposed round-robin studies and outreach activities using the collaboratory tools, and the telepresence and data archiving and mining capabilities provided by the NEESgrid will assure timely dissemination of information to the broad engineering and lay communities. The advanced computational models developed in this project will be readily applicable to many new and existing structures and provide a 3-D model-based simulation capability that can potentially replace physical experiments in a foreseeable future. The implementation of the advanced computational models in a public-domain software, OpenSEES, which is supported by the NEESgrid, will benefit the earthquake engineering community at large. The retrofit techniques explored can potentially lead to significant savings by building owners and enhance the seismic safety of a large number of existing structures. The simplified analytical tools, design and assessment methodologies, and<br/>experimental data will provide the much needed information and tools for the next-generation<br/>performance-based seismic design guidelines on this class of structures. The integration of design, computation, and experimentation in this project provide a unique experience for the training of future earthquake engineers on performance-based engineering.<br/><br/>"

The use of covert sensing of physiological indices could minimize<br/>or even eliminate the use of countermeasures by the subject, while providing the ability to measure the dynamical changes of heart rate (""heart rate variability"" or HRV) that reflect the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is measurably altered during mental provocation. Miniaturized microwave-based systems also have potential medical applications, such as non-contact monitoring of vital signs at a bedside, for burn victims and for research, where the discomfort associated with electrocardiographic (ECG) leads may interfere with a study, as might occur in sleep apnea research when a subject's discomfort alters normal sleep habits. Previous work, has demonstrated the efficacy of microwave-Doppler sensing to measure respiration, pulse rate and eye blinks. The case of ""uncooperative"" subjects has received little attention. In order for a microwave-based system to be useful in realistic settings, several issues related to uncooperative subjects must be addressed concerning signal and noise variability arising from: (1) sudden, unpredictable subject movements, (2) variation of signal with location on the thorax and the angle of incidence, and (3) fluctuation of the distance between the sensor and the subject with time. Remote detection serves a number of medical purposes, including in burn patients which standard sensors of heart variability are in themselves stressful."

The proposed project is designed to actuate and integrate small mammal studies into ongoing research in human origins and evolution and to promptly share collected data worldwide using the Internet. <br/> Micromammalian fossils provide some of the best tools for reconstructing prehistoric environmental conditions, understanding faunal interchange between and across continents, deciphering regional endemism, and visualizing evolutionary patterns through time. Micromammals, comprised of Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Insectivora, and Chiroptera, are a speciose set and occupy a diverse array of very specific niches. In the case of African paleontology and paleoanthropology, studies of small mammals are of particular intellectual merit because they are one of the most effective means of establishing the ecology and environment inhabited by human ancestors. <br/> Research conducted with this instrumentation will include the collection of micromammal fossils and their transportation to the National Museum of Ethiopia, acquiring research quality photographs of specimens, and distributing these digital images to the global scientific community via servers in the National Museum of Ethiopia and the Sierra College Natural History Museum. Training in analytical and technological methods will focus on upcoming African scholars, Sierra College students, and graduate students from the University of California. Broader learning will be fostered through the proposed instrumentation via instruction and outreach programs based from the National Musuem of Ethiopia and Sierra College. The instrumentation will be featured in coursework at Sierra College, in displays at the Sierra College Natural History Musuem, and through links from its website.

Phosphorylation of target proteins modifies their structure, and therefore alters their activities, their interactions with protein or small molecule partners, and/or their locations within cells. Although protein kinases play key regulatory roles in many cellular processes, it has been difficult to identify the precise target proteins for most protein kinases. This project addresses this problem on a broad scale, combining the straightforward genetic analysis and recombinant DNA usage in the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the ability to identify phosphorylated proteins using a chemical method, mass spectrometry. The major goal of the project is to identify the targets of a yeast protein kinase in the casein kinase 1 family, Yck2, which is replaceable by similar protein kinases in mammalian cells. The targets of Yck2 will be identified by comparing phosphorylated proteins in normal cells with those in mutant cells that have reduced activity of the Yck2 protein kinase. Those proteins that are phosphorylated in normal cells but are not phosphorylated or less phosphorylated in the mutant cells will be considered potential targets. Other methods will be used to test whether the potential targets are real targets. The mass spectrometry method that will be used provides the identity of the phosphorylated protein as well as the position of the phosphorylation. Therefore, both targets of the Yck2 protein kinase as well as targets of other protein kinases will be identified. This information will be collected in a database for use by other researchers. The subsequent goals of this project are to study how the target proteins are affected by phosphorylation, and to determine at what point in the life of the cell each target is phosphorylated. In this way, the functions of the Yck2 protein kinase can be understood. This project is important to the scientific community because of the method used, which can be applied to other protein kinases, as well as the information that will be gained about targets of other protein kinases, which will be useful to researchers studying those proteins. The project will also provide scientific education and training in methods of studying proteins on a broad scale to high school and college students as well as graduate students."

Improved understanding of bedrock rivers is important because: portions of the drainage network formed on bedrock exert a disproportionately large control on drainage basin evolution, and effective construction, modification, and removal of dams requires knowledge of bedrock channel form and process.<br/>The proposed research will systematically investigate relations among bedrock substrate, channel geometry, movement of coarse sediment, and flow hydraulics along bedrock channel segments in order to test the existence of a consistent threshold discharge for substantial channel change among bedrock channel segments of differing substrate and geometry. Results from the research will provide insight into key questions of bedrock channel dynamics regardless of whether the data support the existence of a threshold discharge.<br/>Field work will be conducted along the Ocoee River of Tennessee and the Gauley River of West Virginia, each of which includes a bedrock canyon with downstream variations in rock type and channel geometry. Flow along each canyon segment is closely controlled by a dam upstream so that flow is reduced to a minimum and then released at higher discharges on a regular schedule. This will allow us to characterize channel geometry and substrate in detail during low flows, repeatedly measure hydraulic variables under various discharges, and relate hydraulic variables to substrate and to coarse sediment movement and deposition. Field measurements will include: channel geometry and coarse-sediment distribution; substrate in terms of joint geometry, rock-mass strength, lithology, and relative resistance to abrasion; and hydraulic variables (water-surface topography, mean velocity, degree of flow separation) at varying discharges.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Most modern radios perform modulation in a DSP, but still require extensive analog hardware. Since analog devices are both big to begin with and will not scale with decreases in VLSI feature sizes, there has been an ongoing effort to realize signal-processing chains that generate the RF waveform directly. The fundamental problems with this approach are the limited accuracy available in high-speed multi-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and the limited computational abilities of digital hardware. This proposal presents a radical new transmitter architecture that eliminates both of these deficiencies. The essential idea is that the branches in the trellis structure representing the modulator can be labeled with binary strings, which can be passed through a filter and then radiated directly. Thus, the entire problem of building high accuracy, high-speed converters is eliminated. These binary strings are generated offline by a list-decoding algorithm and the entire coder/modulator/transmitter is merely a look-up table. It is proposed to develop this idea further and to adapt it to receivers and other applications. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed research will have substantial broader impact since building higher dynamic range, lower power transmitters and receivers is key to the continued spread of wireless devices. Everything from military radars to structural monitoring systems could benefit. Furthermore, the list decoding approach will have applications beyond wireless communications. This interface is critical in today's digital world both to send and store information. Personal CD players, cellular telephones, high definition TV, computer modems, and deep space communication systems all use analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion blocks. In addition, the project will enrich the department's curriculum and help train students in communication systems and VLSI circuit design."

Thus, they avoid the heating effects that occur even in very high-conductivity copper wires. High magnetic field devices, impossible to make with copper, therefore become a possibility. Unfortunately superconductivity occurs only at rather low temperatures. There was great excitement when MgB2, an apparently simple superconductor made from inexpensive raw materials, was recently discovered to be superconducting at twice the temperature of any other simple superconductor. The electronic characteristics of MgB2 provide unique opportunities to explore the possibility of improving the material's properties to make them superior to those of any present superconductor. This Focused Research Group (FRG) award provides support for an inter-institutional collaboration between groups at the U. of Wisconsin-Madison (UW), Arizona State U. (ASU), Pennsylvania State U. (PSU), and the U. of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez (UPRM). The project seeks to understand how to make MgB2 attractive for applications. The team has already demonstrated that MgB2 remains superconducting in higher magnetic fields than materials based on Nb. More than 99% of all current superconducting magnets are made from Nb based materials. Superconductivity is vital to many aspects of technology, especially to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). General Electric, one of the world's largest manufacturers of MRI machines will collaborate on this study. This effort will be implemented by research carried out by graduate research students and amplified by collaboration with the developing materials science program at UPRM and by outreach at the K-12 level to Native American and Hispanic communities in Arizona. The project is supported by the Condensed Matter Physics, Ceramics, and MRSEC programs in the Division of Materials Research, as well as by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.<br/><br/><br/>***TECHNICAL ABSTRACT***<br/>Magnesium diboride is a hexagonal layered compound recently found to have a 40K superconducting transition temperature, almost twice as high as any other electron-phonon superconductor. Even more interesting is that MgB2 contains two distinct superconducting gaps that are only weakly coupled to each other. The larger sigma gap is formed by in-plane sigma boron bonds, whereas the smaller pi gap results from pi boron bonds between the Mg and B planes. This inter-institutional Focused Research Group (FRG), consisting of groups at the U. of Wisconsin-Madison (UW), Arizona State U. (ASU), Pennsylvania State U. (PSU), and the U. of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez (UPRM), will address fundamental physics and materials science issues of MgB2 alloys, concentrating on bulk-form samples and damage studies that have great potential for MgB2 technology. The project seeks to understand how the upper critical field is affected by scattering in and perhaps between the sigma and pi bands of MgB2 and how the scattering changes as MgB2 is alloyed or ion irradiated. Bulk form samples will be the primary thrust of the studies at UW and UPRM; transmission electron microscopy will be performed at UW. Researchers at PSU will concentrate on modeling of the alloying process. Ion irradiation and connectivity effects will be the focus of research at ASU. The broader impacts are both technological and educational. The superconducting magnet user community is excited by recent demonstrations that Hc2 of alloyed MgB2 can exceed Hc2 of the Nb-based superconductors, from which virtually all superconducting magnets are presently made. US industry and national laboratories, as well as international academic collaborators, will work with the FRG to explore the full potential of MgB2 for cryocooled magnets in the 10-30K range, as well as ultra high-field magnets beyond the reach of any Nb-based material. Outreach collaborations in research through a recently started UW-UPRM NSF-PREM at UPRM will be further developed and K-12 outreach will start at ASU to Hispanic and Native American communities in Arizona. The project is supported by several programs in the Division of Materials Research, as well as by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities."

The project is directly engaging over 900 teachers of grades 5-9 over its three years, including teacher leaders and those who are not yet making use of technology in their classes. Guided by prior research, the program tailors participation to three groups: (1) those who find a site such as the Math Forum and know immediately how to use it with their students; (2) those who find a site like the Math Forum and would like to use it with their students but need support to do so; and (3) those who find a site like the Math Forum and need support to even think that they could make use of it in their classes. For each teacher group, the proposed workshop program is designed to strengthen teachers' mathematical content knowledge, math pedagogy, and use of technology to support students' mathematical problem solving.<br/><br/>Long-term engagement and curriculum integration for all participants is supported by an instructional program that incorporates a technology-based Problem of the Week (tPoW). The program integrates participants into the NSDL-supported Math Tools (http://mathforum.org/mathtools) community of users. Participants are supported to design lessons to go with the tools, evaluate tools, discuss pedagogical ideas, and support one another in active, collegial discussions.

The objective of these visits is to address the development of a universal software modeling language in a systematic manner. The planning visits are expected to lead to a collaborative research plan and proposal that will outline techniques, processes, methods, and tools that support the development of dependable software models.<br/><br/>The proposed research program will explore model-based software development (MBSD) to provide technology that supports the development of dependable systems.  Developers of dependable systems must balance multiple, often conflicting dependability goals in their designs.  This complexity is tackled in MBSD through 1) the use of models that describe complex systems at multiple levels of abstraction and from a variety of perspectives, and 2) the use of technology for transforming abstract descriptions of software to dependable implementations.  The goal of the collaborative research is to produce techniques, processes, methods, and tools that support rigorous evolution of models from abstract to executable forms that are highly dependable. <br/><br/>These planning visits are expected to lead to collaborative research to establish a scientific method for creating a common modeling language that includes security interests early in development.  Software developers will be able to identify and correct errors arising from interactions across dependability features before the system is deployed.  Through the planning visits, the PI's graduate students will be exposed to a range of research opportunities at three diverse universities in Canada and Europe, and benefit from the international exposure.  They will gain a better understanding of the significance of their research in the global context, and will be equipped to leverage the work of international collaborators in their subsequent research."

Thus, they are Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems that integrate sensing with modeling in an adaptive framework. Keen interest in broad application of wireless sensing of the environment, as in NEON and CLEANER, awaits DDDAS technology that can estimate the value of future data in terms of its contribution to understanding against the costs of deployment, acquisition, transmission, and storage. This balance is especially important for environmental data, because networks will typically be deployed in remote locations without access to infrastructure (e.g., power), and sampling intervals will range from meters and seconds to landscapes and years, depending on the process, the current state of the system, the uncertainty about that state, and the perceived potential for rapid change. Network control must be dynamic and driven by models capable of<br/>learning about both the environment and the network. The focus of this project is the dynamic sensor network application involving understanding how biodiversity and carbon storage are influenced by global change. Specifically, this project is designed to learn how the growth, survival, and reproduction of forest trees are influenced by changes in climate, CO2 and disturbance, in the context of these and other variables that can fluctuate rapidly. This goal involves models of how tree growth and resource allocation are influenced by variables that can be understood through adaptive sampling across diverse scales in both time and space. The project will enable a general framework for dynamic data-driven wireless network control that combines environmental modeling and sensor network modeling both in and out of the network. Out of the network, environmental modeling entails full assimilation of all information, with exploitation of computing resources available there. Environmental modeling in the network is based on simplified representations that provide real-time, approximate answers. The in-network control model provides rapid scheduling for new measurements, and it communicates network information to the server, for diagnostics, supervisory control, and data assimilation. Periodically, the in-network model is updated<br/>based on this most complete understanding of the environmental variables, parameters, and battery life. Specific goals are (i) to construct a wireless sensing and networking infrastructure that supports a new paradigm of joint in-network and supervisory measurement, modeling, and prediction, (ii) to develop the modeling strategy needed to combine system understanding with costs for efficient wireless sensing of the environment, (iii) to make significant progress in understanding the maintenance of biodiversity and in measuring ecosystem properties, and (iv) to improve collaboration between computer sciences, engineering, statisticians and environmental scientists."

Whether knowledge is acquired through formal schooling, technical training, or real-world experiences, its usefulness generally depends on how well it can be applied to new problems as well as new situations. Aside from very fixed and unchanging tasks where rote behaviors suffice, new circumstances routinely challenge the learner. Hence, generalization of knowledge to new situations is essential for optimal learning. Understanding generalization of knowledge is important for improving our nation's educational system as well as its ability to stay at the forefront of technological advancement. Innovation requires information learned in one domain to be applied in new and creative ways. The center will examine how we can create methods to optimize this generalization of knowledge and will test them in real-life learning situations.<br/><br/>The center will bring together researchers and practitioners across a wide variety of areas including psychology, education, neuroscience, computer science, cognitive science, linguistics, education, speech & hearing science, and business. The center will investigate the successes and failures of human generalization in a manner that will both extend our theoretical understanding of this issue, while at the same time supporting the development and testing of applications for optimal learning. The center will consider basic research about generalization of knowledge from four distinct approaches. The first approach examines people's behavior, considering both the situations that aid in transfer of learning, and the types of information and skills that are most easily generalized. The second approach examines the different brain systems that support learning, and considers which of them allows for the best generalization of knowledge. The third approach examines the types of information that are most easily generalized and what types of calculations can be performed on them. The fourth approach considers how generalization abilities change with development, aging, and disability.<br/><br/>The applied component of the center will consider generalization of knowledge across a variety of real-world domains including traditional classroom settings and informal learning situations such as museums and after-school youth programs. Practitioners in the center also utilize a variety of technological tools to aid in learning. These include educational databases for teaching about the earth and environmental sciences, computerized systems that aid school-age children in reading and writing, devices to aid individuals with who exhibit limitations due to age or disability, and virtual reality immersive environments.<br/><br/>To accomplish these goals, the center will support two main activities. First, it will bring together researchers across disciplines on a regular basis to exchange knowledge about how generalization of knowledge is conceptualized and addressed from their particular perspective. This program will culminate in a book, whose goal will be to provide a coherent multi-disciplinary perspective on generalization of knowledge. This book will allow what has been learned at the center to be distributed to a wider audience. The second main activity will be to take some of the ideas generated by members of the center and to try them out in real-world learning situations. The center will provide funds for these pilot projects, as well as for funds to support undergraduate and graduate students to work on the projects."

Project activities include: <br/><br/>a) Coordination and improvement of early required courses. As one of the keystones of the project, the partner institutions are working together to redesign three lower division science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses per year to make these courses functionally identical in terms of learning outcomes and generally more effective in promoting student mastery. The redesign includes integration of collaborative, small-group work into first- and second level STEM courses; infusion of high-interest research topics into more general presentations of science, mathematics and engineering fundamentals; and use of new technology tools to give students access to visual representations of STEM concepts that clarify understanding and to create virtual learning communities. <br/><br/>b) Expanding research opportunities in faculty laboratories for freshmen and sophomores and introducing a summer research program for pre-transfer students. <br/><br/>c) Connecting campus cultures through a summer orientation week for transfer students and design competitions linking senior and community college students.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project is found in the knowledge that is being generated by its combination of multiple interventions that have demonstrated success in addressing the content learning and motivational needs of students who aspire to an engineering degree but face the challenges of inadequate early preparation and problems that can arise upon transfer in mid-course of study. By combining approaches with demonstrated success and building an activity plan that uses outcomes assessment as a core design and evaluation strategy, project leaders are synergizing project outcomes.<br/><br/>The project has several important broad impacts extending beyond the project itself that are being widely disseminated: early, improved coursework is enhancing the learning of a broad range of students as affected courses include a diverse range of students; the participating institutions are collaborating on other initiatives beyond this project; and, because the partner institutions each serve a highly diverse student population, the project is expanding the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM professions."

This proposal has also been submitted to NASA and will be jointly funded by OPP and NASA. The Principal Investigators will use geophysical field measurements and remote sensing to investigate the role of Greenland's supraglacial lakes in delivering melt water to the ice sheet's bed and in modulating ice flow on short time scales. Recent results demonstrate a correlation between ice velocity and surface melt draining through moulins to the bed, which may provide a mechanism for rapid response of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) to climate change. Supraglacial lakes are one of the critical links between surface melting and enhanced basal flow, have the potential to rapidly respond to future climate change, and are the focus of the research project described here.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The major result of this project will be significant new knowledge about the formation and dynamics of Greenland's supraglacial lakes and the role of surface melt and lake drainage in modulating ice sheet flow. Over the entire GIS, the project's results will provide the first clear understanding of where and why lakes form around Greenland, the total melt-water volume stored in these lakes, and their relationship to outlet glacier drainage basins. Over the dynamic and climatically sensitive Jakobshavn region, the results will show the interannual variability in lake systems and the available melt water flux from supraglacial lakes to the ice sheet's bed. These observations will be used to test emerging hypotheses concerning the role of supraglacial lakes in moulin formation. New observations of how local and regional climate control lake behavior will yield insight into the potential for lake systems to respond to future climate change. Ground-based measurements and experiments will: 1) allow account for the role of lake drainage in ice flow variability, 2) relate local climate controls to changing lake volume and moulin formation, and 3) provide better constraint on how models predict future ice sheet response to climate change. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Arctic change and Greenland's contribution to sea level rise is of great societal interest and concern. The results of this research will be disseminated to the public through ongoing Principal Investigator efforts including K-12 classroom visits, web sites, press interviews, and other opportunities. Results will be of immediate interest to scientists working to understand past and future changes to the GIS. They will present results in specialized journals and conferences, and will speak in departmental seminars that reach a broad cross-section of the earth science community. This research will contribute to the establishment of a new glaciological program at WHOI and to new collaborations at UW."

The characteristics of the ice sheet itself, especially the missing mass of ice downstream of the volcano, will be used as a geothermal probe. The approach unites potential field data, ice-penetrating radar, satellite images of the ice surface, and regional estimates of the structure of the Antarctic lithosphere. If successful, the work would improve our knowledge of the geodynamic history of the Antarctic continent, and demonstrate how ice sheets can be used as natural continental-scale heat flow probes. Given that many areas beneath West Antarctica have been identified as volcanic terrains, and the tectonic history of this area is so poorly constrained, these are key questions for understanding the geodynamic history of the Antarctic continent. Estimates of regional heat flux are also one of the key uncertainties in modeling the formation and evolution of the ice sheets. The broader impacts of this work include education of a postdoctoral student and improving understanding of the formation and evolution of the Antarctic ice sheets, which are key factors in global climate change and sea level rise."

A MMP generally involves multiple operations to produce a product, which can be found in many industrial processes such as automotive body assembly, machining lines, progressive stamping, and semiconductor manufacturing. In a MMP, each operation adds inherent design variation when no fault occurs, and special assignable variation when a fault occurs, to the workpiece variation. The output workpiece of one operation is the input of the next operation. The final product variation is an accumulation of variation from all operations. Therefore, the characteristics of variation propagation is very complex in MMPs, depending on both product and process design. The research efforts in the project will develop methodologies to achieve on-target production with minimum variance by addressing both design and manufacturing concurrently. The research focus is to develop: (a) a math-based model to describe the variation propagation in a MMP; (b) an integrated methodology for variation management through design synthesis and optimization; and (c) statistical methods driven by engineering models for quick root cause identification and product defect prevention. In addition to research, new curriculums and courses will be developed. Various collaborative efforts with industry, international universities, and K-12 schools will be conducted in research and education in the project.<br/>If successful, the project results will enrich the science base and technologies in variation reduction and process control methodologies for MMPs, which include: (a) analytical (rather than empirical) modeling of MMP variation and its propagation; (b) synthesis (rather than analysis) of product/process tolerance for optimal management of inherent design variation to minimize their impact on final products; (c) real-time root-cause identification (rather than change detection) for manufacturing process control and continuous improvement; and (d) prognostics (rather than defect inspection) for defect prevention throughout the manufacturing lifetime. The developed unified methodology will generate significant economic impacts in industrial sectors where MMPs are used.<br/><br/>This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in May 2004."

These laboratories break new ground by using the Grid for education in the same way that science uses the Grid. <br/><br/>A pilot ""e-Lab"" is already in development through the QuarkNet/Grid Project's Cosmic Ray Collaboration. Under this grant, I2U2 will complete more substantive evaluation and enhancement of the pilot and will support the development of prototype labs and associated resources, for both formal and informal education, by multiple experiments. I2U2 is particularly focused on reaching communities underrepresented in science, and several of the partners are situated in areas with high minority populations.<br/><br/>The educational content of these labs will leverage the science of a broad range of NSF-funded research projects to create effective, exciting opportunities for K-12, undergraduate and informal education. The delivery vehicle for these labs, interactive ""collaboratories,"" will provide resources for hands-on exploration of some of today's most relevant and exciting scientific topics. The focus will be on providing scientific data, analysis tools with which to explore the data, and the facilities to interact and collaborate. Participants will learn data analysis skills and how the massive computing resources afforded by Grid computing are a key in enabling the exploration of important scientific problems. Constrained neither by distance nor time, students, teachers and scientists will together explore approachable versions of the discovery environments employed in the broad spectrum of research projects at the frontiers of science. <br/><br/>The collaboratories will take two similar but distinct shapes.

China's upper Yangtze basin is an excellent site for LUCC research. Induced by high population density, rapid economic growth, and historical resource exploitation, regional land uses and land covers have witnessed tremendous change, including depletion of primary forests, degradation of grassland, and farming on steep slopes. These disturbances have resulted in worsening soil erosion, elevated levels of greenhouse-gas emissions, and severe damage to the rich web of life. While recent efforts have been made at ecological rehabilitation, the outlook of the regional environment is far from certain or optimistic. This research project will conduct a two-year pilot LUCC study in the upper Yangtze basin. Project objectives are (1) to measure the attributes and dynamics of LUCC in the upper Yangtze basin; (2) to explore sampling and modeling strategies to determine the factors influencing land-use and land-cover change and make future projections; and (3) to develop and validate datasets and approaches for assessing the environmental impacts. To accomplish these objectives, project investigators will (1) integrate the natural and human processes at multiple scales; (2) build spatial, physical, and socioeconomic datasets from various sources; (3) identify specific ways for obtaining additional socioeconomic and ecological data, verifying the data quality through surveying and ground truthing; (4) develop case studies to profile regional land-use and land-cover change, with a focus on technological and institutional changes; and (5) search for appropriate procedures to incorporate technological and institutional changes as well as system feedbacks into the LUCC models.<br/><br/>The project is expected to advance basic knowledge of the forces that produce regional land-use and land-cover change and environmental impacts of that change. It will spur the development of more effective models as well as future plans for similar but larger integrated research and educational endeavors. Knowledge of regional land-use and land-cover changes will guide China in designing and implementing policies and technical actions that promote sustainable land use and environmental protection. It also will aid China in fulfilling its commitments to restoring its ecosystems, which is in line with its Forestry Action Plan for Agenda 21, Blueprint for Ecosystem Development, and other international obligations. China's experience will benefit those countries that face environmental challenges while undergoing economic transition and other nations that have been contemplating how to combat the worsening resource and environmental conditions while reducing poverty. Moreover, enhanced knowledge about land-use and land-cover changes in China is relevant to such international initiatives as the Kyoto Protocol, the Convention on Desertification Combating, and the Convention on Biological Diversity. This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems."

A single teaspoon of ocean water often contains over 1 million individual microbial cells. Given limited differences in size and shape, distinguishing one species from another under the microscope is difficult. Associating specific functions with individual cells or populations is even more challenging. Marine microbes drive biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and other elements that are critical to the function of the biosphere. Understanding relationships between microbial diversity, microbial metabolism and biogeochemistry is one of the great challenges facing microbial ecologists today. Metaproteomics is a new and untried approach to identify proteins present in microbial communities.  Proteins are the engines that drive all chemical reactions in cells and can be used to identify specific microbes as each contains unique protein profiles.  Thus, identifying proteins in microbial communities will provide information about what microbes are present in a given sample and what they are doing at the time of sampling.  This research will apply metaproteomics to marine microbial communities to: 1) compare the protein expression patterns over geographic and temporal scales; 2) identify proteins of particular interest from specific samples; and 3) link specific microbial functions with individual microbial groups. Proteins extracted from microbial community samples will be resolved based on mass and charge to provide an image of the community protein profile.  Similarities and differences between different samples will be quantified by comparing these images. Sequence information for specific proteins of interest will be gathered and used to identify both the protein and most probable microbial source of the protein. <br/><br/>This project will provide the first in depth metaproteomic study of a dynamic and highly complex marine microbial assemblage.  Metaproteomics is an alternative and complementary approach to metagenomics and environmental transcriptomics.  Although many novel microorganisms have been detected in the ocean, the vast majority of marine microbes still cannot be grown in the laboratory.  As a culture-independent approach, metaproteomics will address what proteins are actually expressed in microbial communities rather than the potential expression measurements provided by metagenomics and transcriptomics. This project will support two graduate students and provide both with highly interdisciplinary training spanning the fields of microbial diversity, biological oceanography, analytical chemistry, and bioinformatics.<br/>"

The workshop will introduce the Indian mathematics community to the complex analytic aspects of moduli problems, which were initiated by Teichmueller and further developed by Ahlfors, Bers and their students, several of whom will participate in this workshop. Since this approach has not taken root in India, the workshop will provide the exposure and engagement of Indian mathematicians in furthering developments in this field through international collaboration. <br/><br/>The HRI is India's premier institute for mathematics and physics with active research programs in differential and algebraic geometry, number theory, and string theory. Leading mathematicians from other Indian research centers-of-excellence will participate. The main goal is to connect scholars from both countries with similar interests, as a major step towards furthering joint research. Considering that Teichmueller theory has interesting applications in string theory and the HRI has a very active research group in this area, this will be an excellent opportunity for US participants interested in exploring the relationship between the two.

On Caribbean islands, as elsewhere in the world, ants are a very important component of virtually every terrestrial ecosystem. Although native ant species are integral to the functioning of intact natural ecosystems, the native ant diversity of most Caribbean islands remains largely unknown. Now several destructive exotic ant species, including the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are spreading through the region, acting as economically important pests and threatening native invertebrate diversity. Although the presence of certain exotic ant species is a reliable bio-indicator of ecosystem degradation, few local researchers currently are capable of distinguishing native ant species from invasive exotic pests. Researchers on this project will survey and inventory ants on all 30 major islands (>50 km2) in the Eastern Caribbean, including the Greater Antilles east of Hispanola (Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands), the Lesser Antilles, the Leeward Antilles, and the South American Shelf islands. In addition, researchers on this project will train local researchers in the Eastern Caribbean and undergraduates in ant research techniques. <br/><br/> The research component of this project will form a solid foundation for all future studies of Caribbean ants. Research products will include descriptions of new species, faunal inventories for each island, biogeographic and ecological analyses, and distribution and impact assessments for different species of invasive ants. Technological products will include a web accessible database of all specimen information and a web-based interactive key for identifying Caribbean ants. The education component of this project will train local researchers to help limit the impact of invasive ants and help preserve the unique biodiversity of Caribbean islands."

This focus on overlay functionality has left unanswered the single most critical question: What lies underneath? What is the appropriate minimal, universally shared environment to underlay the overlays?<br/><br/>The core of an underlay that supports an increasing multiplicity of overlay opportunities lies in three key elements. First, there must be some means of information discovery and dissemination through with overlays learn about the underlying Internet; a so-called Information Plane. Second, elevating overlays to first-class objects places special emphasis on the coordinated assignment of complex collections of network resources (e.g., bandwidth, storage, computational cycles, shared information) to competing overlays in an economically coherent, computationally practical fashion. This requires an Economic Framework for resource allocation. Third, there is a complementary question of how to define the basic unit of resource, and the challenges in the implementation of decisions made in resource allocation by means of Virtualization. Combined, these elements form the critical core of an operating environment for overlays; the necessary universal substructure for an overlay-enabled world. These three elements play a pivotal role in this research program: they are both a key objective (output), and at the same time, essential for building a scalable wide-area testbed that allows researchers to evaluate new ideas under real-world conditions."

ATP sulfurylase plays multiple roles in nature: (a) In fungi, yeasts, most heterotrophic bacteria, algae, and higher plants, this enzyme catalyzes the first intracellular reaction in the reductive assimilation of inorganic sulfate into organic molecules. In these organisms, APS is the active sulfate precursor of cysteine, methionine, etc. In all organisms, PAPS serves as the sulfuryl donor for sulfate ester biosynthesis. (b) In anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria (e.g., Desulfovibrio), ATP sulfurylase forms APS solely to serve as the terminal electron acceptor of heterotrophic metabolism. (c) In certain chemo- and photolithotrophic bacteria (e.g., Aquifex, Chromatium), ATP sulfurylase catalyzes the last reaction in the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds to sulfate i.e., the physiological reaction is in the opposite direction compared to that in sulfate assimilators. Sulfate (sulfuric acid) produced by sulfur chemolithotrophs is believed to be responsible for shaping many terrestrial caverns and for the acidic runoff from pyrite-containing mines. A long-term goal of this project is to identify the structural features that optimize the catalytic and regulatory properties of each class of homooligomeric ATP sulfurylase for the physiologically relevant task. Immediate efforts will focus on the homohexameric enzyme of Penicillium chrysogenum, which is allosterically inhibited by PAPS, the product of the APS kinase-catalyzed reaction. Experiments are proposed to determine (a) the mechanism by which the APS kinase-like regulatory domain communicates with the catalytic domain, (b) the structural basis for the high selectivity of the catalytic and allosteric sites for sulfate/sulfonucleotide over the more common phosphorous analogs, and (c) the functional properties of several chimeric forms including one that contains true APS kinase as the C-terminal domain and may channel APS between sites.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: A cross section of California students will receive training in the methods of molecular biology (cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, expression and purification of mutant and chimeric enzymes), enzymology (steady-state kinetics, equilibrium ligand binding, computer-assisted simulation and analysis of data), and protein chemistry (x-ray crystallography, chemical modification of target residues).

These earthquakes have afforded an exceptional<br/>opportunity to study the coseismic and postseismic effects of large<br/>subduction earthquakes, including the gradual decay of postseismic fault<br/>afterslip and viscoelastic flow and re-emergence of interseismic elastic<br/>strain accumulation. Studying these earthquakes and their after effects<br/>have numerous intellectual merits, outlined below. Specific goals for<br/>the proposed project are as follows: (1) Continue annual measurements of the<br/>regional velocity field to characterize spatial variations in viscoelastic<br/>flow and afterslip triggered by the Mw=8.0 Oct. 9, 1995 Colima-Jalisco and<br/>M_w=7.6, 1.22.2003 Tecoman earthquakes, (2) Construct a six-station continuous<br/>GPS network to better characterize the temporal evolution of these viscoelastic<br/>and afterslip responses and better separate them from the underlying linear<br/>elastic strain accumulation. Continuous measurements will enable determine of<br/>whether the Cocos/Rivera subduction interfaces accommodate downdip transient<br/>aseismic slip events similar to those recently described for Cascadia, Japan,<br/>and southern Mexico. (3) Complete modeling of the coseismic and post-seismic<br/>effects of the 2003 Tecoman earthquake using existing and new observations,<br/>including a joint inversion of the geodetic and seismic constraints,<br/>collaborative analysis of local seismic data for aftershock relocations, and<br/>sensitivity analysis for our assumed elastic constants, layer thickness,<br/>and subduction interface geometry. (4) Employ measured variations in<br/>the direction and magnitude of interseismic strain accumulation to<br/>both estimate the degree of locking along the Rivera and Cocos plate<br/>subduction interfaces and relate onshore strain accumulation to<br/>the oceanic plate motion. (5) Determine how the 1995 Colima-Jalisco earthquake<br/>and subsequent processes altered stress levels in the adjacent Tecoman earthquake<br/>rupture zone. (6) Extract information about upper plate deformation associated<br/>with the continental rifts in our field area from GPS, seismic, and Shuttle<br/>Radar Topographic Mission data. As has been the case in previous stages of<br/>this project, the present phase of the project will have numerous broader impacts.<br/>Three Mexican scientists will participate as official collaborators: Osvaldo Sanchez<br/>of UNAM, Bertha Marquez of the Universidad de Guadalajara, and Gabriel Reyes of<br/>the University of Colima, as well as Mexican undergraduate and graduate students<br/>from three universities. In addition, support is requested for a UW graduate student<br/>to continue his finite element modeling of the geodetic data for his dissertation,<br/>a Caltech graduate student who will work with Gabriel Reyes on local seismic data,<br/>and two REU undergraduates who will work under Stock's guidance. Data from the new<br/>continuous sites will constitute a useful legacy for other investigators, particularly<br/>for detecting and characterizing transient signals related to aseismic slip along<br/>the subduction interface."

Botte, Daniel Castro, and Scott Miller<br/>Ohio University<br/><br/>CMS 0533290 ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Investigators at Ohio University are working on the development of a new technology that can produce hydrogen on demand through the electrolysis of ammonia (ammonia electrolytic cell-AEC), and its implementation to generate power for residential housing. A 36-month program is proposed to provide the fundamental information required for designing, constructing, optimizing, and scaling up an AEC that will significantly contribute to the energy requirements of residential houses. The other objective of this application is to develop a teaching curriculum designed to educate engineering students and community members (users) on the fundamental principles of fuel cell technology and house energy efficiency. The project proposes the following specific aims: (1) Assess the technical, economical, structural, and safety implications of the use of the technology (solar cell/AEC/proton exchange membrane fuel cell) in residential houses. This will be achieved by optimizing the performance of a bench-scale AEC, estimating the costs of scaling up the cell to the residential housing settings, evaluating the safety implications of the use of the proposed technology in a house, and laying out the appropriate location of the system. (2) Design a series of seminars to train the community about the use of the technology for residential applications. The focus of these seminars will be to increase awareness and seek feedback about hurdles that must be overcome in order for the technology to be practical, affordable, and reliable in a residential setting. Surveying the community and implementing focus group meetings are part of the methodology to achieve this aim. Different models developed during the seminars will be posted to a website for the project, with the intention of reaching out to a broader audience. (3) Develop an introductory course in applied electrochemistry for sustainable construction.<br/><br/>This proposal will assess the feasibility of using an ammonia electrolytic cell for generating power in residential houses. The primary motivations for this project center on the benefits to be derived by addressing current house energy issues: high operating costs, dependence on nonrenewable energy sources, and high potential for greenhouse gas production and global warming. Currently, several new threats underlie two other factors that can be added to this list of motivations: potential security crises resulting from intentional attacks that could force power plant shutdowns and the inflexibility of fuel supply and costs due to global political unrest and international oil market volatility. All these issues could be addressed by constructing self-sustainable houses (independent of the grid) powered by renewable energy sources (e.g., solar panels) in combination with an ammonia electrolytic cell (new technology to produce hydrogen on demand) and hydrogen fuel cells (e.g., proton exchange membrane fuel cells). The significance of this project is quite far-reaching. In the educational field, the project will engage the housing-community in learning about the use of sustainable energy and fuel cell technologies. If the feasibility of the new technology proves successful for residential housing, the national, environmental, and security implications will be enormous. First, CO2 emissions from the housing sector to the environment will be reduced by up to 42%. Second, national security will be enhanced through a reliable power source for American homes, making them less susceptible to intentional attacks. In a larger perspective, the technology could be extended to use fertilizer run-offs, farm run-offs, and waste water-all of which contain ammonia as fuels-to provide power for America's homes."

Such debates are simultaneously about what should count as engineering knowledge and who engineers should be as people. The PIs will spend eighteen months collecting and analyzing data on what has counted as engineers and engineering knowledge in eight different countries. The project tests the descriptive hypothesis that distinct patterns of engineering identities and valued forms of engineering knowledge emerged, in part, as responses to nationally distinct metrics of progress. An initial outcome from the project is a book-length, comparative historical ethnography of engineers and the metrics of progress. Methodologically, the project relies on ethnographic interviews, participant observation, and extensive collection of primary and secondary documents to map engineering education archaeologically from the present to the past and metrics of progress historically from the past to the present. Mapping engineering education involves outlining current debates and reform movements in engineering education and documenting the emergence of the principal structures and emphases in engineering education. Mapping metrics of progress involves exploring the emergence and evolution of the nation and national identity, modes of education at all levels, and dominant popular images of progress. A second outcome is expanded research collaboration among Virginia Tech, Colorado School of Mines, and Taiwan's National Tsing Hua. This project calls attention to the national and transnational importance of engineers and engineering knowledge by using the concept of professional identity to re-theorize engineering. The project will help policymakers in engineering education both inside and outside the U.S. better engage and participate in national and transnational deliberations over educational policies. Over the past two decades, virtually every country in the world that produces engineering graduates has been rethinking and restructuring the contents of engineering education, often implementing dramatic changes. This project will conduct the spadework that will put the uniqueness of the current situation in historical perspective, documenting how globalization and the dominant contemporary logic of economic competitiveness have different implications for engineers and engineering education in different countries. Accounting for national differences in engineers and engineering knowledge is a key prerequisite to understanding contemporary movements to globalize engineering education. <br/><br/><br/>"

Despite the remoteness of the complex phenomena that constituted the various origins of the key aspects of terrestrial life, particularly the metabolic and replication mechanisms, numerous relics survive in the core pathways and features of modern organisms. This interdisciplinary project will synthesize these separate but convergent clues to early life from primordial geochemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, thermodynamics, evolutionary biology and the dynamics of genomes, to provide a coherent account of the evolution of metabolism and the development of the modern genetic code. This research will place strong constraints on the likely environment, manner and core metabolism of early life on Earth. The broader impacts of this interdisciplinary approach will be a working template for efforts to predict the nature of extra-terrestrial life and its detection from metabolic activity or other environmental effects. This project will be disseminated to a broad audience through a writer-in-residence program, trade publications, museum exhibits, an active web site, and K-12 outreach. Emanating from the research activities are projects involving highly-talented under-represented minority students from the Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute of Arizona State University, the NSF REU programs at the participating institutions, and the SFI Complex Systems Summer Schools. Results of this work will be integrated into core curricula and seminars emphasizing the centrality of multidisciplinary, biocomplexity-oriented collaboration in modern research, thus combining curriculum with opportunities for participation. The project will include a symposium intended to summarize its outcome to K-12 educators, and provide an overview of modern biogenesis and its broader implications for astrobiology."

This project develops methods for reconstructing past water chemistry and food webs of lakes. The biological and chemical deposits in surface sediment samples will be compared with the water in 62 modern lakes. The resulting relationships will be tested by comparing sediment cores with 24 years of observations from the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research (NTL-LTER) site. The methods will then be used to reconstruct 150 years of history for several lakes, adding perspective to the long-term observations of the NTL-LTER and testing the prediction that lakes high in the local landscape had more severe and longer-lasting effects of 19th century logging than low lakes that are more influenced by groundwater. This research will also help to understand the response of lakes to severe droughts that last decades to centuries by identifying periods of low lake levels during the last 10,000 years. Understanding the variability of the responses of lakes to climate change and disturbance is essential to predicting the responses of particular lakes to future changes in land use and climate. <br/>This project will bring together expertise from several strong programs at the University of Wisconsin (the Center for Limnology, Botany, the Center for Climatic Research, NTL-LTER, and UW-LaCrosse), with the Limnological Research Center and LacCORE National Lacustrine Core Repository at the University of Minnesota and the United States Geologic Survey Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical Budgets (WEBB) project. Cores collected in this project will be archived at LacCORE and made available to future researchers, forging important new links between the LTER network, the paleoecology and paleoclimate communities, and groundwater scientists at the USGS.

However, recent investigations suggest that even perceptions of physical space can be influenced by the social and emotional context. The proposed research explores such social and affective factors in perception. In contrast to traditional theories, ecological approaches suggest that perception may depend on contextual factors not previously considered. For example, some research shows that hills seem steeper to a person wearing a heavy backpack (Bhalla & Proffitt, 1999). Contextual factors influence perception because they are relevant to actions: A hill is harder to climb for an encumbered person, and thus, appears as steeper. In contrast to physical properties, such as the weight of a heavy backpack, not much is known about properties that are more ""psychological,"" such as the social and affective nature of an interactive environment. Social and affective factors, such as being in a group or being in a good mood, are known to influence social judgments such as ratings of life satisfaction. The proposed research will explore whether perceptual judgments are similarly influenced by ""the power of the situation."" <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to determine to what extent perception is shaped by social and affective factors. Several studies will examine the influence of a number of different factors on estimates of distances to objects and slants of hills, such as whether another person is present, or what affective values judgment objects have. Building on this beginning, an additional outcome of the proposed research is the development of perceptual measures that reveal people's affective responses to various stimuli. That is, if people's feelings influence how they perceive distances to attitude objects, then it should also be the case that one can infer their attitudes from their perceived distances. By examining these hypotheses, we expect to get a glimpse of how social factors affect basic processes previously assumed to be insulated from such influences. <br/><br/>The Broader Impact of the project includes educational experiences for the persons involved in the research, such as for the undergraduate and graduate students working on the project, as well as for research participants who will receive detailed information about the research as part of their debriefing after participation. This research promotes interdisciplinary as well as international collaboration. Findings from the project are expect to be broadly disseminated by the public media, because previous research by the investigators involved in the project has attracted considerable attention in the popular press. Findings involving participants' gender, racial and ethnic background will be informative in investigating the extent to which cultural differences in spatial behavior are associated with differences in spatial perception."

Specific research objectives are to: (1) use unique observations from the Great Lakes Ice Cover-Atmospheric Flux (GLICAF) project to understand and quantify the relationship of surface fluxes to heterogeneous pack ice concentrations, (2) use case-study, climatic, and numerical model simulations to understand the structure of multiple-lake bands and the influence of environmental parameters on their development and evolution, (3) quantify the influence of environmental conditions on cold frontal structure and evolution as synoptic fronts interact with lake-effect systems, (4) use Doppler radar measurements, accompanied by atmospheric and environmental datasets to determine the favorable conditions and the organization of mesoscale snow events associated with lake-effect systems over small mid-latitude lakes, and (5) examine cloud and ice spectrum characteristics, as well as radiative flux profiles, across a range of lake-effect systems. <br/><br/>Results of this research will give valuable insight into complex processes that often complicate winter forecasting of mesoscale phenomena common to the Great Lakes region. These results will be communicated to the meteorological community through journal and conference articles and to the operational community through regional workshops and presentations at National Weather Service offices."

The process is being designed to correct for rater-bias (e.g., halo, leniency, severity) automatically. With this instrument, engineering faculty can determine: (1) how successful a teaming experience actually is for participating students, (2) the impact of team training methods on the teaming experience, (3) what team formation strategies best promote course learning objectives, and (4) the types of intervention strategies that will improve overall team functionality. Indicators of effective teams are being based on peer evaluations for each team member, as provided by other team members. Vignettes are being used to investigate the accuracy of students' ratings of team members, and to correct for rater bias, as compared to expert judgments, in actual peer ratings. Students' perceptions of functionality are being operationalized in terms of a self-report instrument requiring students to indicate the degree their team is working together across a range of domains, including interdependency, learning, potency, and goal-setting. In evaluating their project, the investigators are comparing the attitudes of students who have used the instrument to those of earlier students who did not. They also are cross-validating effectiveness prediction with an instructor's observations of team effectiveness and with the students' course grades. In addition an Assessment Review Panel meets semi-annually to monitor progress and identify problems. The approach is being tested at three other institutions. The investigators plan to present and publish their work in both engineering education and general higher education research venues."

In Guanajuato, Jalisco, Zacatecas, and Durango, Mexico, large ceremonial centers sprang up, surrounded by clusters of population.  One such population cluster around the site of La Quemada, Zacatecas, is the scene for this study.  Between A.D. 500-900, a large community dominated the valley and its tributaries with a monumental ceremonial center, roadways, extensive terrace systems, and over 200 villages along the Malpaso River.  <br/>Professor Ben Nelson and doctoral candidate Michelle Elliott of Arizona State University, along with Professor Christopher Fisher of Kent State University, will collaborate with geologist Roberto Molina of the National Autonomous University, to collect plant remains, sediments, magnetic samples, and charcoal for radiocarbon dating and to create a geological map of the area.  They and other scientists will analyze the samples to test hypotheses about changes in vegetation, erosion, floodplain characteristics, and fires that occurred before, during, and after a period of intensive human settlement around La Quemada.  They will recover this information by cutting trenches in the floodplain as well as by surveying the landscape to record landforms and parent materials that may have contributed to the accumulation of sediments and soils in the floodplain.  Their goal is to reconstruct the history of that accumulation and its relationship to human occupation.<br/>Archaeologists have long suspected that the changes in the environment played a role in civilization's fluctuations in this region.  They hypothesize that colonists settled the frontier during a period of increased rainfall and that several centuries later, a climatic reversal led to the region's abandonment.  Since Pedro Armillas formulated this ""arid margin"" hypothesis, archaeologists have learned a great deal the settlements centered on La Quemada.  Recent research has clarified many aspects of this occupation, but the information is inadequate to address the arid margin hypothesis.  The collected materials will allow systematic evaluation of this hypothesis with several independent classes of data, including pollen, phytoliths, macrobotanical remains, magnetic susceptibility, sediment characterization, and radiocarbon assays.<br/>Archaeologists have not investigated ancient environmental change in any part of the Northern Frontier in such a comprehensive way.  To the north of the study area, studies of desert streams in the American Southwest indicate precipitation flux for this period; to the south, lake deposits contain evidence for potentially related events.  Experience shows, however, that events in one valley or lake cannot be readily predicted from those in another.  This study will provide information that will ultimately allow evaluation of human-environmental interactions on a long time scale over a wide region.  The investigators plan to communicate their findings not only to people in their own profession, but to a range of ecologists, geologists, geographers, government officials, and interested community members.<br/><br/>"

Understanding the importance of species' interactions and their impact on communities is thus a central goal of ecologists and conservation biologists, and is the central aim of this work. The overarching goal is to examine the interactions between termites and large vertebrates in supporting the biological diversity of East African savannas, and to understand how these groups affect the distribution, diversity and abundance of other species. Such an understanding is of paramount importance as these habitats are lost, fragmented, and modified through agricultural use. Termites have been identified as key species, crucial to the functioning of entire ecosystems. In East Africa, termite mounds are a common feature of the landscape. Through their mound building activities, termites enhance soil nutrients and thus may be affect the diversity of the plants and insects that live in close proximity to these mounds. Vertebrates have also been implicated as playing a large role in the ecology of savanna habitats. However, the interactions between termites and herbivores and their effects on communities have rarely been examined. This work will provide novel data on the interactions between termites and vertebrates in providing habitat and resources that structure plant and animal communities across much of East Africa. These data are critical to understanding the forces that generate and maintain habitat heterogeneity and species diversity and to managing savanna ecosystems.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will support one full-time Post-doctoral Researcher, one part-time Post-doctoral Researcher, two graduate students (one in Kenya, one in the U.S.), three full-time technicians (two in Kenya, one in the US), and two part-time field assistants each year. The project will also be used for teaching at least 20 students per year through UC Santa Barbara's Kenya Wildlands Program. Yearly meetings will be held with the Laikipia Wildlife Forum, which includes scientists, local ranch managers and traditional Maasai pastoralists, to discuss the results of the project. The results will be disseminated to scientists in Kenya at the International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology, the National Museums of Kenya and the University of Nairobi. The project represents a significant contribution to human resource development, bridge-building among scientific institutions and among the scientific and lay communities of East Africa, and education in a geographical region where such opportunities are rare.

Because cnidarians diverged from the rest of the animals prior to the evolution of organs, their overall anatomy is quite simple. Despite this however, cnidarians have attained incredible diversity, comprising over 11,000 species, many of which display elaborate structures and complex life histories. The lack of organs and other anatomical landmarks has made it difficult for scientists to discern their evolutionary relationships. Recent technological and theoretical advances in the sequencing and analysis of DNA provide the opportunity to use the information encoded within an organism's genetic code to elucidate evolutionary relationships. The primary aim of this proposal is to obtain DNA sequence data from 1,800 cnidarian species: this will generate approximately 23 million base pairs of cnidarian DNA sequence, and the specimens from which the sequences are obtained will be retained in natural history museum collections. The information encoded in the DNA will be used to reconstruct cnidarian phylogenies (evolutionary trees), using computer algorithms and supercomputing facilities. Some of the questions this proposal will address are: Was the ancestor to all of cnidarians solitary or colonial? Are jellyfish or hydras more closely related to the corals? How and when did coral skeletons evolve? What are the evolutionary transitions between a simple hydra polyp and a complex Portuguese Man-of-War colony? Reconstructing a cnidarian evolutionary tree is important for our understanding of the patterns and processes that accompanied the early diversification of animal life. <br/><br/><br/><br/> Formal and informal education will result from this research. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars, including those belonging to groups under-represented in the sciences, will be trained. A symposium on cnidarian evolutionary relationships will be organized by the investigators at a national scientific meeting. A Cnidaria Tree of Life database will be developed to include outreach and learning components such as images, common names, and keys designed to appeal to students at all levels as well as interested users such as divers and aquarists. Museum exhibits will be created based on research results, one at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum, and one, entitled ""Cnidarian Diversity in the Oceans"" that will be part of the new Oceans Hall, due to open at the National Museum of Natural History in 2008. A website and classroom poster (in both English and Spanish) integrated with the latter exhibit will be created in collaboration with a K-12 educator supported through NSF's Research Experience for Teachers program."

Because the growth rate oscillates, as do the underlying physiological processes, it is possible, using cross-correlation analysis, to determine if a process precedes or follows the change in growth rate. The main objective of this project is to focus on anticipatory events, because they are thought to represent primary regulators of growth.<br/><br/>Three apical events that anticipate increases in growth rate will receive attention as follows: increase in cell wall thickness, increase in pH in the alkaline band, and the oscillatory inward movement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As a working model it is suggested that secretion anticipates growth and accounts for the cell wall thickening, that changes in alkalinity modulate the structure of the actin cytoskeleton, and that changes in actin dictate the movement of ER and secretory vesicles. <br/><br/>Using different microscopic methods, including ratiometric ion imaging, fluorescence confocal imaging, and electron microscopy (EM), secretion, pH, and actin structure will be examined. Secretion dynamics will be probed using a pollen specific pectin methylesterase, linked to GFP. Oscillations in pH will be determined in cells injected with BCECF-dextran. Experimental modification of pH and/or the activity of the H+-ATPase will characterize the relationship of the alkaline band to growth. The structure of actin will be examined at the EM level. Finally, the activity of the actin cytoskeleton will be probed by examining the motion of ER. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: This project emphasizes the inclusion of underrepresented minorities as primary investigators in the research/discovery process. Dr. S. McKenna, who is a faculty member at Long Island University (LIU), where there are many minority students, is a Senior Collaborator. His involvement is two fold: firstly, as a researcher, he shares in the discovery process, and greatly improves the upward trajectory of his career.

To better understand the processes of melt migration in a heterogeneous and multiscale mantle and to promote interdisciplinary research and education, a CMG research project that builds around the existing strengths and resources of the Applied Math and Geological Sciences departments at Brown University is proposed. The project will focus on four closely related themes: (1) theoretical and numerical studies of reactive dissolution in multicomponent, viscously deformable, porous media with sharp interfaces; (2) development of numerical methods for solving multi-dimensional and multiscale geologic problems; (3) development of multiscale models for studying partial melting, melt transport and melt-rock reaction at converging and diverging plate boundaries; and (4) comparison with geochemical and geophysical observations. Stability analysis and numerical calculations using adaptive discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods will be used to study the formation of high porosity melt channels in the mantle. The heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) coupled with discontinuous and finite volume methods will be developed for studying magma transport processes on large length scales. A double porosity model will also be developed for a viscously deformable duo-porosity medium with permeability tensors, and mass, momentum, and energy transfer rates between the high porosity channels and the low porosity matrices being determined by theoretical and numerical calculations. This new generation of models will establish a framework for understanding geochemical and geophysical observations over length scales ranging from millimeters to hundreds of kilometers. <br/><br/>The proposed theoretical and numerical developments, challenging in their own way, are useful to a range of practical applications far beyond the Earth Sciences. Results from this study will provide valuable information for a diverse group of mathematicians, geochemists, and geophysicists, promoting cross-disciplinary integration in applied math and Earth Sciences. The interdisciplinary nature of this proposal will have a great impact on graduate and undergraduate education at Brown University. Graduate and undergraduate students from both Departments will have the opportunity of involvement in a broad multidisciplinary research and educational activities. Projects like the one proposed will create an environment in which to train a new generation of scientists with the broad multidisciplinary skills needed to derive new understanding from the more discipline specific results of the past."

The consortium has four objectives: (1) Recruit and prepare undergraduates to pursue a PhD in SBE fields, (2) Assist students in the transition from undergraduate to graduate study, (3) Retain PhD students and increase degree completion rates, and (4) Prepare future SBE faculty for success. Although each of the five schools in the AC-SBE alliance has unique features, the AC-SBE Alliance will include a number of overarching activities that will involve all five universities. For one example, the Alliance will build upon Howard University's Summer Institute that prepares future faculty in the STEM disciplines to launch a parallel SBE component. Also, entering AC-SBE students will be invited to participate in a one-week course Introduction to Data Analysis for the Social Sciences at the Odum Institute for Research in the Social Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Odum Institute will also offer a number of videoconference short courses for AC-SBE students. Efforts will be made to ensure that the students in the SBE Alliance have further opportunities to interact and network at conferences such as the NSF-supported EMERGE. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Through integrating the resources of the five AC-SBE Alliance institutions, AC-SBE will have a broad impact across a wide region of the country in the eventual production of SBE PhD recipients. Thus, AC-SBE will serve as a comprehensive project for recruiting, mentoring, and graduating URM students in SBE PhD programs, and to carry out strategies to identify and broadly support URM students who want to pursue graduate studies and academic careers. The norms of inclusiveness at the AC-SBE Alliance institutions and the relationships that have been forged will endure well past the termination of grant support to continue efforts to ensure the significant numbers of minority students pursue and receive PhD degrees and enter the professoriate."

Over time, these populations will diverge genetically if specialists on one of the possible resources leave more offspring than do more generalized individuals. If this specialized resource use alters the pattern of mate choice such that individuals tend to mate with others utilizing the same resource or habitat, these divergent populations are likely to become two different species. Although the many products of speciation in the distant past are clearly visible in the millions of species on Earth, reconstructing the process of speciation as it occurs within diverging populations is difficult because important clues to the processes disappear after speciation is complete. First, diverging populations in different geographic locations experience natural selection on the various resources semi-independently-- they may approach speciation at different rates or even evolve toward different outcomes. Secondly, some genes within incipient species diverge very rapidly under the divergent natural selection, and patterns of molecular variability at these genomic regions tell the genetic story of speciation. However, these unique patterns are obscured over time, and eventually all genes will tell the same story, so analyses of anciently diverged species cannot identify the crucial genetic changes that drive the process. <br/><br/>Here, a well-studied set of populations of an insect species (the pea aphid) that are specialized on different host plants will be used to capture a glimpse of the early stages of speciation. Using molecular population genetics, both geographic differences between pea aphid populations across the US and the heterogeneity of divergence across the genome during speciation will be analyzed. This project will provide a high-resolution picture of speciation as it actually occurs, before crucial details are obscured by the passage of time.<br/><br/>The pea aphid is an introduced agricultural pest. These results will not only illuminate basic evolutionary process, but will serve as a model for the study of evolution in other invasive taxa. Students and postdoctoral associates will be trained in an integrative research approach that crosses traditional scientific boundaries between ecology, microevolution and systematics. The unique genetic and ecological tools developed in this project will be widely used by members of a growing consortium of scientists working on pea aphid genetics, which is one of the species newly targeted for genome sequencing. Finally, the PI uses her research to inform her extensive efforts to educate the broader community about evolutionary biology."

Of particular concern are certain conventional systems, such as concentrically braced steel frame buildings, which are quite prevalent and whose design may rely on more inelastic energy dissipation than the systems can provide. The proposed research aims to develop a new structural system that employs rocking action and replaceable structural fuses to provide safe and cost effective resistance to earthquakes. The system combines desirable aspects of conventional steel-braced framing with two alternative and complementary fuse concepts - shear panel fuses and axial column fuses. The fuses utilize novel materials and components, including combinations of high-performance fiber reinforced cementitious composite shear panels fuses, low-yield steel shear panel fuses, and buckling-restrained axial column fuses. Guided by performance-based capacity design principles, the fuses are easily replaceable and can be tuned to provide optimal performance. Through a combined program of computational and experimental research, the project will encompass component and complete system response and synthesis of the results through a methodology for performance-based design that directly assesses life safety and life-cycle economic factors. The proposed concept emphasizes damage prevention to foundations and other structural elements that are difficult to repair; inelastic energy dissipation in structural fuses that are easy to replace; story drift control so that nonstructural damage is reduced; and sufficient safety against collapse. The research will involve quasi-static testing of a large-scale frame subassembly at the NEES facility at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and dynamic testing of a large-scale frame at the E-Defense shake table in Miki City, Japan. Outreach activities will focus on a project web site, web-based telepresence, and participation of undergraduate and graduate researchers."

The principal investigator and his colleagues promote innovations consistent with PATH objectives, through a primary focus on Production (creating a paradigm shift for construction from site to factory), Building Enclosures (innovating a structural design concept using pre-manufactured stacked monocoque units) and Energy / Whole House Design (integrating low energy and sustainable technologies). They address the housing industry's inefficiencies and fragmentation, caused by the slow adoption of new housing technologies, by setting out a number of research objectives that promote a paradigm shift using automotive technology transfer methodologies in the design and procurement process for housing. Process based innovations will include technologies appropriate to industrial design by adopting Product Design Development Process Modeling associated with Life Cycle Analysis appropriate to industrial ecology to form the basis of restructuring the traditional supply chain process and supporting sustainability imperatives respectively. Alternative mass customization opportunities for manufactured housing systems and their interaction with production line activities will be explored, taking advantage of improved construction accuracy and sequences of assembly through multi-dimensional digital simulations using object oriented digital design. Component design innovation will include systems integrated thermally insulated panels that perform as combined wall and floor systems that will sustain passive energy exchange within the house enclosure. Energy systems will incorporate integrated performance based controls that will optimize on energy consumption. Their proposal for a new paradigm will require a step change in thinking by the industry and as such the project has identified a strategy for engaging with a broad range of industry partners. The project will be run as collaboration between university units, which build on a project prototype for a prefabricated and transportable house that is powered exclusively by solar energy.<br/><br/>Current housing manufacture exploits a short sighted, least common denominator market that maximizes profit at the expense of social and environmental quality. In contrast, the investigators seek to elevate the technological knowledge base in housing design towards a highly efficient design and manufacturing approach that uncompromisingly integrates environmental and social sustainability features. A technology transfer paradigm shift is proposed by the investigators that will transform traditional construction methods into a mass customized production process that will benefit society through improved property performance, which will directly impact national concerns about the environment, the state of the housing infrastructure and the improvement of low income housing communities. A new genre of affordable medium density buildings will be conceived that will be more adaptable, durable, and energy efficient as whole-life housing typologies. Their new paradigm for housing design and construction will initiate a social transformation from depressed low income groups towards a progressive home owner society that has more lifestyle choices, therefore encouraging the viability of mixed use developments which will serve as a model for creating socially sustainable communities. The project objectives are motivated by the potential to create opportunities to repopulate blighted urban city areas. Therefore the investigator and his team will be creating an initial focus on sites situated in the Detroit inner urban area, as a model for repopulating these denuded urban zones. Significantly, the principles of their proposal will be equally relevant to the re-densification of cities throughout the United States and the rest of the world. The project's pedagogical value will be diffused through student based design studios and research projects, set within this research framework across multi disciplinary boundaries, which form part of a social outreach program already in existence within the University."

It is important, therefore, to bring multi-disciplinary sciences to bear on this topic. In particular, the policy questions outlined above should simultaneously draw on at least social psychology, personality psychology, cognitive psychology, decision science, and economics. In order to foster increased attention to research synergies at this multifaceted juncture, this project's main activity will be a preconference on judgment and decision making preceding the 2006 annual meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. The preconference speakers, including Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman, will represent some of the most important research advances in judgment and decision making. They will include not only psychologists, but also economists, decision scientists, and neuroscientists. <br/><br/>The requested funds will be used primarily for two purposes. First, funds will provide scholarships to graduate students to facilitate their participation in the preconference. Second, funds will pay for equipment rentals related to speakers' presentations. This will allow the preconference to keep registration fees low, especially for graduate students. In addition to the intellectual advances inherent in bringing this group of researchers together, the broader impact of this project will be to increase the participation of talented students in the interdisciplinary topic of judgment and decision making. Because many of the questions studied in judgment and decision making have direct policy application, as described above, increased research in this area will contribute to an important knowledge base for the public good."

The method rests on a mathematical scoring algorithm that gives respondents an incentive to provide truthful and carefully considered answers to questions, even though only the respondent knows which answer best matches to their truthful opinion. The method could be used to collect truthful expert forecasts of events in the far future (e.g., whether mankind will survive past year 2100), truthful expression of personal tastes or intentions (e.g., intentions to vote), and truthful self-reports of personal behaviors and characteristics (e.g., risky sexual practices).<br/><br/>The main idea behind the scoring algorithm is to give high scores to answers that are more common than predicted, with predictions generated by the same respondents who answer the questions. It follows from Bayesian reasoning that truth-telling maximizes expected score even for a respondent who is sure that their truthful opinion represents a minority view. Furthermore, in situations where there is a single objectively correct answer to a question (i.e., a question dealing with objective knowledge), the scoring algorithm should be able to identify the objectively correct answer even if the majority of respondents endorse a different, incorrect answer."

This project will use Lake Superior as a study site and the goals are: (1) To characterize the changes to the chemical and optical properties of DOM when exposed to 1O2; (2) To determine the changes in lability and nutritive quality of DOM following reaction with 1O2; (3) To examine the differential microbial utilization of 1O2-reactive amino acids-histidine, tryptophan, methionine, cysteine, and tyrosine-and their 1O2 reaction products, and (4) To quantify 1O2 production rates in Lake Superior.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, DOM from two sources (soil and phytoplankton) and along a temporal-spatial gradient (river and offshore) will be exposed to a number of treatments including sunlight and well-defined sources of 1O2 with and without quenchers present. This study features the use of non-photochemical 1O2 sources that will enable examination of effects of 1O2 independent of sunlight. Effects on lability and chemical structure of DOM will be observed via bioassays and chemical analyses. The hypothesis that decreased microbial growth efficiency is observed in the presence of oxidized DOM, due to the reaction of 1O2 with specific amino acids present in DOM will be tested. This study is expected to be the first to demonstrate whether or not singlet oxygen is responsible for many of the changes in DOM bioavailability when it is exposed to sunlight. It will also produce some of the first measurements of singlet oxygen concentrations in large aquatic systems.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, it ic certain that microbes and photochemical processes play a central role in environmental biogeochemistry. The processes examined in this project will facilitate understanding of global dynamics such as the carbon cycle, nutrient limitation and eutrophication. This project will support a young investigator (McNeill) and is collaboration between an ecologist and a chemist. In addition, several activities in the proposed project will promote teaching and training goals including: training and education of undergraduate students and graduate students and K-12 teachers. The PIs will participate in summer undergraduate research programs directed toward minority students (through the College of Biological Sciences LSSURP Program). The PIs will also participate in a K-12 teacher-training program focused on freshwater ecology. Additionally, this project will link with the NSF-RSEC program at the University of Minnesota by fostering an existing collaboration between one of the investigators and a faculty member at a Principally Undergraduate Institution."

In addition, these institutions have documented success in meeting AGEP goals in the STEM (science, technology engineering and mathematics) fields. CUNY is currently part of a MAGNET/STEM AGEP alliance partnered with the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Polytechnic University and Stevens Institute of Technology. U-M, MSU and WSU partner with Western Michigan University to form the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA). Now CUNY and the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA), consisting of the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University, will combine efforts in a new regional alliance to advance the goal of the National Science Foundation to promote efforts that will increase the production of underrepresented minorities (i.e., African American, Hispanics, American Indians, Asian/Pacific Islanders) in the social sciences at the B.S. through Ph.D. and early career levels. By both sharing resources and best practices across the alliance and including SBE fields in existing AGEP programs, the CUNY/MAA Alliance for the SBE sciences will increase participation in summer research programs, expand recruitment and research opportunities for social sciences students, further develop targeted relationships with minority-serving institutions, provide across the alliance student mentoring and mentoring training for faculty, coordinate skill building workshops to help ensure graduate study success, expand student support groups, enhance fellowship support, increase teaching opportunities and expand teacher training workshops, increase the support of students attending professional workshops, and expand postdoctoral and early career education. The intellectual merit of the project will focus on the advancement of education by enhancing existing excellent educational programs and providing SBE students at the graduate, postdoctoral and early career stages with additional experiences that they would not normally receive. The impact of these interventions will be evaluated and best practices shared widely. Our experiences will enhance knowledge on the methodologies critical to the process of the professionalization of social and behavioral scientists. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. The broader impact of the project will develop through the institutionalization of a larger pool of individuals studying and conducting research in the social sciences through the utilization of effective strategies that will attract, motivate, and train domestic talent, especially among underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities. The result of these activities will be to advance understanding of the role of the social sciences in the nation, as well as to strengthen the national workforce."

The acquired MRM system will provide a University wide MRM user facility where appropriate samples from any MSU research lab can be interrogated by MRM by a trained operator. The acquired MRM system will allow the execution of initiated projects on ice-soil-hydrocarbon interactions, on bio-polymer dynamics, and on the interaction of geochemistry, biological activity and hydrology in subglacial sediments. MRM microscopy methods allow noninvasive measurement of fluid dynamical, chemical and biological activity in natural systems, providing unique data for the development of conceptual and numerical models of systems in which hierarchies of scales play a role in the system physical, chemical and biological evolution.<br/><br/>The MRM group is active in educational and outreach activities such as Expanding Your Horizons, a workshop aimed at female middle school students, and Montana Apprenticeship Program which is a summer internship program for disadvantaged Native American high school students. The MRM group prepares undergraduate and graduate students for careers in the fields of micro-fluidics and 'bio-engineering studies using MRI' through publication in journals, participation at international conferences and involvement in multi-disciplinary research teams. The research conducted by the group provides the ability to quantitatively measure dynamics and structure-function using MRM and has the potential to impact medical diagnostic imaging and bioremediation of environmentally contaminated sites providing benefit to society.

By integrating and developing research and theory from six key areas, Cognitive Learning Theories, Cognitive Modeling, Neuroimaging, Philosophy of Social Science, Virtual Reality Enhanced Perspectives, and Educational Applications, a robust learning model can be assembled that illuminates the acquisition of knowledge in the Social Sciences. The Center will directly address limitations to social science learning that result from how students acquire knowledge. Student preference for predictability over variability and the tendency to make dispositional rather than situational attributions for behavior, for example, both play key roles in limiting learning and flexible thinking in the Social Sciences. The integration of research will help scholars both to create more effective models for teaching social science concepts and will provide a platform for further investigations and research. During the catalyst grant, working groups will research and review basic issues in each participating field and identify the best possible integrated foundation for moving forward<br/><br/>The inspiration for this center comes from work on learning in math and science, as well as basic research on social perspectives, learning and thinking. Research on learning in math and science has over the past forty years has demonstrated that prior knowledge and established that patterns of thinking interferes with students' efforts to learn physics, statistics, mathematics, probability and almost every advanced theoretical field. Social psychology has unearthed well-defined patterns of thinking that influence how all people come to understand social events and decisions. Our goal is to bridge results from these two bodies of research. As it stands now, the problem we will address not only prevents students from acquiring a complex understanding of social science, but impedes the construction of social theories and related empirical investigations. We will design a Center and research plan that considers how the corpus of ideas across social science are influenced by patterns of thought, and how the mechanisms we use to teach Social Science can be more effectively developed. Results from the catalyst grant will include:<br/><br/>-A mapping of social science concepts to the properties of the human mind that learn those concepts <br/>-A comprehensive cross-disciplinary set of protocols for conducting research on social science learning<br/>-An on-line collaborative environment for maximizing interdisciplinary research on social science learning and training social scientists to engage in interdisciplinary research on learning<br/>-New paradigms for understanding the role and influence of perspectives and misconceptions on complex knowledge acquisition."

Each year, eight RUTE Scholars are being selected competitively from an applicant pool consisting of biology majors who have completed Calculus I for Biology and Mathematical Methods for Biology, and mathematics majors who have completed General Genetics and Ecology and Evolution. These RUTE Scholars take a summer course in Research Skills for Theoretical Ecology, and are subsequently grouped into two research teams, each of which consists of two biology students and two mathematics students, at least one faculty mentor from each of the two disciplines, and a biology graduate student. The four-term research experience consists of i) intensive study of the theory and field methods relevant to the research project; ii) ecological research at a field site; iii) mathematical analysis using their field data and mathematical modeling related to the ecological research; and iv) a capstone course in which the teams complete their research and prepare it for presentation. The program design ensures sufficient time and mentoring for success in research preparation, collection of field data, mathematical modeling and analysis, and preparation of results for dissemination, leading to a successful transition to graduate school and career.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The RUTE program is developing a sustainable infrastructure for interdisciplinary research, thereby increasing faculty competitiveness and contributions to new knowledge. RUTE is attracting and preparing more students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to conduct research at the interface between mathematics and biology, thereby increasing the number of students pursuing graduate studies and engaging in interdisciplinary research. A Symposium on Undergraduate Research in Ecology is held annually and disseminates RUTE research results to other institutions in the Great Plains and gives students from those institutions a forum for presentation of their own research results. The RUTE program leads to models of effective cross-disciplinary training, in general, and mathematical training for biologists, in particular."

It addresses nonradiative properties of individual gold and silver nanoparticles and the effects of interparticle coupling on these properties. A new capability in electron beam lithography capable of producing nanoparticles as small as few nanometers will be used to focus on changes in relaxation processes and the period of the coherent lattice oscillations (produced by femtosecond electronic laser excitations) as the size, shape and the interparticle distances change. The effect of the substrate on interparticle coupling will also be examined. The changes in these properties will give an understanding of the nature of the coupling of these assembled particles.<br/>The broader impacts of this project are both educational and industrial in nature. For example, with regard to the properties of individual Noble metal nano-particles, as their size and shape changes their ability to scatter and absorp light strongly changes, and these properties can be used to record clear images of single cancer cells. Another property of these nanoparticles is that strongly absorbed light energy is rapidly converted into heat, a property that can be used to selectively destroy cancer cells by using a very low level of laser radiation that is not harmful to healthy cells. Thus understanding properties of individual nanoparticles enables novel applications, and students trained in these areas are very competitive in the academic, industrial and National Laboratory job markets related to broad fields of nanotechnology."

Some decompose organic materials, others are pathogens, and others are mutualistic symbionts important for plant health or animal nutrition. The Epichloe species are symbionts (endophytes) of grass plants with both mutualistic and pathogenic states. They and the related endophytes enhance drought tolerance, insect resistance, and other fitness factors in many temperate grasses used as forage or turf, but some also produce toxins that can negatively affect grazing animals. The goal of this project is to sequence the genome of the model endophyte, Epichloe festucae, in order to discover genes involved in mutualistic and pathogenic interactions with host plants, as well as with grazing animals. The fungal genome will be fragmented and cloned into plasmids, approximately 150,000 of which will be sequenced from both ends of the inserted genomic DNA. Computer analysis will identify sequence overlaps, resulting in assembly into large scaffolds, and these assemblies will be subjected to other computer analyses to identify the genes. Discovered genes will suggest mechanisms of fungal benefits to host plants, the transition to pathogenesis, and toxin biosynthesis. <br/><br/>The genome sequence of this model plant-symbiotic fungus will be a crucial resource to the broader scientific community for comprehensive genetic studies of plant protection, plant disease and toxin biosynthesis. Furthermore, this and related fungal endophytes have major economic impacts, both negative and positive, in U.S. agriculture. A negative impact is that some cause livestock toxicosis costing the beef industry $600 million annually, with additional impacts on other livestock and wildlife. The major positive impact is that these endophytes improve longevity and productivity of pasture, turf, and conservation grass stands. This project will help elucidate the mechanisms both of beneficial and detrimental endophyte effects, thus facilitating agricultural utilization of endophytes to maximize their overall benefits."

They will measure independent temperature and terrestrial runoff indices from a new class of tetraether biomarkers within a dense spatial network of surface lake samples from the Baffin Island region. They will calibrate these biomarker indices to steep temperature and precipitation gradients across Baffin Island and extending to Iceland, Labrador and S. Greenland as well as the northern Canadian Archipelago. This surface sediment network will allow them to develop a lake temperature proxy for low-temperatures, and provide the first calibration of a runoff index to precipitation data. Long sediment cores from Iceland and Baffin Island will be targeted for high-resolution paleoclimate records throughout the Holocene and beyond, to quantify the degree of warming during the last deglaciation and Holocene Thermal Maximum. They will also quantify temperature changes during the Last Interglaciation. These intervals represent time periods of greater warmth that are poorly constrained in quantitative temperature, but are critical for estimating the impacts of future warmth on Arctic environments.<br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>Accurate records of the pattern and timing of climate change in the Arctic are important to<br/>understanding how the global climate system functions. The Arctic is a globally significant region with respect to climate, and the effects of global climate change might be identifiable in the Arctic before they can be found elsewhere, as suggested by the large and rapid changes documented throughout the Arctic environment in recent years. In addition to showing sensitivity to global changes in climate, the Arctic may also be capable of forcing widespread climate shifts, and detailed records of Arctic climate change are thus critical to the construction of an integrated picture of the global system. The Arctic is an important region for discriminating between natural and anthropogenic forcing of climate, which is particularly relevant for the rapid warming during recent centuries when paleoclimate records have implicated an anthropogenic contribution to recent warming, above and beyond the contribution from natural forcing mechanisms. Accurate calibrations of climate proxies are crucial to resolving differences between regional compilations and deriving reliable estimates of the magnitude of current warming, as well as quantifying warming during past intervals when the Arctic may have been ice-free.<br/>Broader Impacts: This study will provide research opportunities and training for one female Postdoctoral Scholar and one female Research Associate. These scientists will benefit from direct experience learning cutting-edge organic geochemical analytical techniques, and will have opportunities to travel, interact with different research groups, and present their results at international meetings. The Principal Investigators are active in outreach to the public and policy-makers. Specific activities include lectures to science journalists and Representatives to the U.S. Congress, as well as interviews for TV and domestic and international news organizations. The study will investigate the use of organic biomarkers to reconstruct lake temperature and precipitation records from Arctic Lacustrine sediments. They will use multiple parallel compounds and analytical techniques to maximize the information extracted from the sediments. The use of organic biomarkers in sediments for the study of paleoclimate processes is still a young field, and they anticipate that the wealth of data arising from the proposed analyses will lead to new insights and the development of new biomarkerbased environmental proxies."

The LSST will provide time-lapse digital imaging of faint astronomical objects across the entire sky, with a resolution that would require over two thousand High-Definition TV screens to view each 10-second exposure. The LSST has been identified as a national scientific priority by diverse national panels, including multiple National Research Council committees. This judgment is based upon the LSST's ability to address some of the most pressing open questions in astronomy and fundamental physics, while driving advances in data-intensive science and computing. For example, the LSST will provide unprecedented 3-dimensional maps of the mass distribution in the Universe, in addition to the traditional images of luminous stars and galaxies. These mass maps can be used to better understand the nature of the newly discovered and utterly mysterious ""dark energy"" that is driving the accelerating expansion of the Universe. The LSST will also provide a comprehensive census of our solar system, including potentially hazardous asteroids as small as 100 meters in size. These are but two examples of the wide-ranging science that can be carried out with the LSST data set. By looking at the entire accessible sky every few nights, the LSST will provide large samples of events that are now only rarely observed and will create substantial potential for new discoveries. The LSST will produce the largest non-proprietary data set in the world, and this data set will be made accessible through the Virtual Observatory (VO). The ""open data"" approach, with no proprietary data or science, is a precedent-setting aspect of the LSST project.<br/><br/>The LSST program will be distributed among a number of organizations and coordinated under a single management plan. A consortium of three Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories is responsible for the delivery of the camera assembly. The NSF National Center for Supercomputer Applications and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) will be responsible for tasks in data management in collaboration with other software experts on the LSST team. The National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) and the University of Arizona will take the lead for telescope design and construction. <br/><br/>Funding is being provided to carry out the next stage of LSST project development. A comprehensive design and operations model, with cost estimates, for both the LSST hardware and software will be provided. The scientific, technical, and managerial groundwork for the construction phase of the LSST will be laid. Particular attention will be paid to early reduction of risk in three areas: the camera's detectors, the large optical elements of the 8-m class telescope, and the project software (which will have to contend with 20 Terabytes per night, in real time).<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the LSST will be profound, as scientists, the public, and schoolchildren around the world will have ready access to the data. Broader impacts of the initial design and development activity include 1) the training and education of personnel at all levels, integrating state-of-the-art computational science with astrophysics; 2) using existing LSST ""precursor"" projects to advance the state-of-the-art in real-time database schema and public access tools; and 3) developing and refining an LSST education/outreach program via LSST precursor survey data that will pay near-term dividends in K-adult education. Finally, there may be significant technical overlap between the LSST and the needs of other imaging systems and software under development in the national security arena.<br/>Funding for this award is coming from the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate."

Kursar, both of the University of Utah, to initiate a promising international collaboration with Dr. Maristerra Lemes of the Instituto National de Pesquisas da Amazonia (INPA) in Brazil on a project to study the ecology and chemical defenses of the tropical legume tree, Inga. Plants and herbivores make up the majority of the earth's biodiversity and their interactions are extremely intense in tropical forests. The evolutionary interaction between herbivores and plants has led to an ""arms race"" in which innovation in plant defenses are met by counter adaptations on the part of herbivores. In tropical forests, the vast majority of herbivory occurs on young rather than mature leaves and there is enormous variation in damage among species, yet little is known as to the underlying cause of this variation.<br/><br/>Beginning in 2002, the PI established the Inga project in Panama and this visit will represent the first geographic expansion of their work out of Panama. The objective of the visit to colleagues in Brazil is to establish a collaboration studying Inga in the Amazon where it is particularly diverse and abundant. Using a phylogenetic approach, the project will examine the nature and activity of secondary metabolites in young leaves of a number of Inga species, and correlate this with other plant defenses, and with actual damage rates in the field. Methods include analyses of plant chemistry, feeding trials with herbivores to assess toxicity, and field quantification of herbivory, leafing phenology and the construction of a phylogenetic tree."

Computational science is now considered the third leg of science after theory and experiment. The use of computational science in government laboratories, industry, graduate, and professional institutions has generated a corresponding demand for undergraduates trained in the techniques of computational science- mathematical, computing and science skills. Furthermore, teaching science, technology, engineering and mathematics at any level is no longer about inundating students with facts. The development of critical thinking skills as well as the ability to understand abstract concepts is an essential component of the learning process. Active participation by the student (discovery approach) and teacher (facilitator) are essential. While existing department instrumentation has been used to provide hands-on experience in laboratories and undergraduate research, the very important area of computational science and computational chemistry in particular remains very sparse in our present curriculum. Additionally, the department has incorporated in the curriculum a strong undergraduate research component, starting as early as the freshman year. Mindful of national trends, the overall objective of this project is the adaptation and implementation of existing computational science, in particular,<br/>computational chemistry applications (from successful NSF and DoE supported initiatives and the literature) across the chemistry curriculum. A Computational Chemistry Laboratory is being created by using fifteen existing workstations, twenty-five new student graphics workstations, sixteen wireless laptop computers, and a multiprocessor Linux server networked to the campus fiber optics network and available for on- and off-campus access, as well as the appropriate software packages to accomplish this goal.<br/>Broader Impacts: The hardware and software being implemented are providing increased facilities for experiential training for the students. Each year, 1100 -1200 students from the different STEM disciplines take the broad range of courses offered by the Chemistry Department. The facility is providing for the development and implementation of new courses (molecular modeling, bioinformatics, etc.) in the chemistry and biology departments in order to attract students (undergraduates and high school) as well as faculty from the various STEM disciplines. Student involvement in research is an integral part of the many efforts to encourage and prepare undergraduates to enter graduate programs as well as the work force. Additionally, during the summers a number of projects have high school participants (NASA Sharp). Research activity in the Department of Chemistry is being greatly enhanced with the acquisition of the new computing equipment. In addition to chemistry majors, the department is involved in training programs with other departments on campus, and often students from other departments work with chemistry faculty and students on collaborative projects. All students supported by NSF (HBCU-UP) and other grant programs such as MARC-USTARS are expected to participate in research. The new equipment is allowing broader research offerings to more undergraduate and graduate students."

Since each individual gene locus is only a small part of the whole picture, association studies based on correlating variation at one or a few gene loci to disease outcomes may miss significant larger-scale associations. An attractive alternative that may be more revealing is to base association studies on correlations between disease outcomes<br/>and haplotypes across selected genomic regions, A prerequisite for association studies, whether they are based on a few loci or on larger-scale haplotypes, is an accurate method for haplotype frequency estimation in a given population. The differences between the haplotype frequencies in a healthy population and in a population of<br/>affected individuals may be subtle. Thus, getting an accurate estimate for the haplotype frequencies is extremely important for disease association studies. Estimating haplotype frequencies is a non-trivial task because current sequencing methods may produce noisy or incomplete data and typically yield genotypes, whose resolution into pairs of haplotypes is ambiguous. Existing methods for haplotype frequency estimation are mainly heuristic in nature, and they are only suitable for large samples of unrelated individuals from a homogenous population over short genomic regions. Any deviation from these conditions may result in inaccurate estimates. The main goal of this project is to develop efficient and accurate tools for haplotype frequency estimation under different conditions, and to integrate these methods with novel tools for disease association studies. In particular, the following activities are proposed: develop accurate, efficient and robust methods for haplotype frequency estimation over short and long genomic regions; extend these methods to deal with small sample size and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to population substructure, and incorporate pedigree<br/>information into the haplotype frequency estimator; integrate the resulting tools with a systematic tool for disease association studies that looks for candidate loci automatically using multiple calls to the haplotype frequency estimator; and launch a web server that will allow geneticists to upload their data and run the programs developed in the project on the fly through the web server.<br/><br/>The direct effect of the project would be to reduce the sample size needed for association studies, thus making more studies possible under the same budget constraints. This in turn will lead to a better understanding of complex diseases, which may speed up the search for diagnosis and treatment tools. The mathematical models introduced in this project may shed light on haplotype structure and on evolution. Furthermore, the project will address optimization problems and statistical learning<br/>problems that may be of use beyond the scope of genetics. The diverse tasks of this project include algorithm design and implementation, software integration and biological modeling. Thus, there is a wide range of activities that are suitable for students of all levels. This will give students an exciting exposure to multidisciplinary research involving computer science, statistics, genetics and mathematics. The methods developed in this project will be integrated in bioinformatics courses at UCSD, and<br/>the material will be publicly available as PowerPoint presentations on the web.<br/>The software developed in this project will be integrated with the existing publicly available web server HAP."

In this research, collaborative software that extends Wiki technology to support science learning by high-school students will be created. Students will learn about science content and method by collaboratively researching and writing about controversial science topics, supporting their writing with strong citations, and publishing their writing on the Internet. The site that is available to the students is Science Online. Science Online is an open-content science encyclopedia-anyone may add or modify its content at any time. This site will be persistent (similar to wikipedia) and will grow organically over time to the point that it becomes a useful reference for the general public. In addition to being useful in itself, this more importantly will help create a motivating, authentic context for high-school science students contributing to Science Online. The research hypothesis for education research is that having a real audience for published work will encourage students to be more engaged, since they see their work product as having real value to others. Second, Science Online will allow students to demonstrate sophisticated meta-cognitive strategies as they reflect on the real audience for their writing and what that audience may or may not understand. Tools to support the students in their use of Science Online will be developed and made available to the public. Additionally, lesson plans will be developed to incorporate the use of Science Online in science instruction in High Schools and will be made available to the public."

The work outlined in this project will advance understanding of natural killer (NK) cells in birds (represented by chicken). NK cells recognize other cells (healthy and infected) using specific molecules (receptors) displayed on their surfaces. Preliminary work suggests that the surface receptors preferred by chicken NK cells are somewhat different from those used in mammals and fish. To define the nature of these NK cell receptors surface proteins will be isolated from chicken NK cells and analyzed using an essentially unbiased high throughput system to identify receptor proteins. Corresponding genes will be cloned. Receptors will be expressed and their ligands will be identified. Broader Impacts: The findings will be useful in comparing the immune responses generated by birds to that of mammals, and it may be useful in developing future strategies to combat disease, particularly those caused by viruses shared between man and birds.

Fe oxide particles in the nanometer size range (< 100 nm) are<br/>ubiquitous in nature and their occurrence ranges from ultra-fine mineral dust in the atmosphere to<br/>nanocrystalline precipitates in the hydrosphere. Research into the reactivity of nanoparticle Fe oxides has<br/>been primarily aimed at understanding the bonding characteristics of atoms adsorbed at the surface. It is<br/>now recognized, however, that the behavior of Fe in the environment is strongly influenced by bacterially<br/>driven redox reactions, as well as the local chemistry and nature of mineral surfaces in rocks and soils,<br/>and by the presence of water. Therefore, detailed investigations of the redox chemistry of Fe oxide<br/>nanoparticles under conditions analogous to nature are critical to understanding the role of these tiny<br/>particles in the cycling of Fe in the environment.<br/>The proposed research will use advanced spectroscopic and analytical techniques, in conjunction<br/>with selective isotope labeling, to investigate redox processes occurring at the surface of Fe oxide<br/>nanoparticles in the presence of water. Of particular interest is the bacterially driven interaction between<br/>aqueous Fe, and mineral and cell surfaces, as well as redox reactions occurring during (i) Fe isotope<br/>exchange, (ii) transport of atmospheric Fe mineral dust, (iii) pollutant reduction, and (iv) microbial Fe<br/>oxidation. The experiments will use well characterized Fe oxide nanoparticles in batch and column<br/>reactors designed to mimic natural conditions by varying biogeochemical conditions, including microbe,<br/>mineral, and water composition, as well as flow conditions.<br/>Intellectual Merit. Despite the key role of Fe(III)-Fe(II) reactions in environmental and industrial<br/>applications, heterogeneous redox reactions occurring on nanoscale Fe oxides have been largely unexplored.<br/>This is due, in large part, to the analytical and spatial complexities of studying heterogeneous reactions of Fe<br/>in the presence of water. The proposed methodology overcomes this obstacle by using an innovative<br/>combination of 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy and high precision aqueous isotope ratio measurements to<br/>simultaneously measure isotope specific oxidation states and concentrations of Fe at the Fe oxide-water<br/>interface. This approach, in tandem with X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron<br/>microscopy (TEM), will provide new information on how and where redox reactions occur on Fe oxide<br/>nanoparticles. The synergistic blend of expertise in Fe geochemistry, microbial Fe respiration, and<br/>atmospheric Fe mineral dust brought together with the proposed NIRT provides an unparalleled opportunity<br/>to study redox reactions involving Fe oxide nanoparticles during multiple components of the Fe<br/>biogeochemical cycle. Observing reactivity . particle size trends for four diverse, but related reactions<br/>provide a powerful mechanism to identify new phenomena that are unique to oxide particles within the<br/>nanometer size range.<br/>Broader Impacts. An innovative combination of spectroscopic and isotopic techniques, in addition<br/>to comprehensive mineral characterization methods, will result in an improved understanding of the behavior<br/>of Fe oxide nanoparticles in air, water, and soil. Our findings will directly impact newly developing theories<br/>on global carbon cycling (via microbial Fe respiration and atmospheric deposition of Fe in the ocean), as well<br/>as challenge our current understanding of important environmental and industrial processes including<br/>degradation of soil, sediment, and water quality, the evolution of earth.s geologic/magnetic record (via Fe<br/>isotope biosignatures), accelerated rates of corrosion, and condensation processes (which may have led to the<br/>origin of life on earth and biological activity on Mars).

The state-of-the-art wildlife monitoring technologies, including radio-tracking and wireless sensor networks, do not provide sampling of animal resource selection, behavior patterns, and the environmental context of the animal's behavior. The central objective of this interdisciplinary award is to bring the video monitoring capability to wireless sensor networks so as to collect important visual information for wildlife behavior analysis and interaction modeling. The overall goal of the research is to develop a long-lived and unobtrusive wildlife video monitoring system capable of real-time video streaming with remote control capability. The captured video in real time will be transmitted over wireless sensor networks to a remote monitoring center for real-time viewing and camera control. Because real-time transmission requirements are particularly challenging to wireless sensor network design, the research will address important issues on energy minimization and performance optimization in video sensing over mobile wireless sensor networks. The PIs will engineer a portable, low-energy, rugged, wireless network video/GPS/motion sensor coupled with an optimized transmission protocols and routing schemes for transferring the video images through sensor node design, access control, and robust routing protocol. Deer-net is a highly innovative interdisciplinary engineering, computer science, and wildlife science project in the field of cognitive ecology. The video monitoring has the potential to significantly advance this area of science and engineering and has broader application to other fields including surveillance, security, process monitoring, and other industrial applications. The broader impacts will arise from multi-disciplinary collaboration among computer scientists, engineers, and wildlife biologists; participation by students spanning undergraduate to doctoral levels; integration into ongoing courses; recruitment of under-represented groups; and educational opportunities for K-12 students to observe wildlife behavior."

Disruptions in the timing, amount, and location of monsoon rainfall can seriously affect the livelihood of these people and create widespread economic, social, and health-related problems. Unfortunately, basic understanding of the linkages between monsoon variability and human institutional response is less comprehensive than is desirable primarily because of a paucity of long-term instrumental records of monsoon variability and historical documents that describe how the peoples of the region have coped with this variability. One approach that offers the potential to develop significant insights into this problem is historical ecology, a research orientation that seeks to obtain simultaneously data on climate change and human response to it over long time frames. In this research project, a multidisciplinary team of researchers from the paleoenvironmental science, geomorphology, archaeology, and archival studies will the study the causes and consequences of a hypothesized abrupt shift in the intensity of the Asian monsoon around AD 1300. This project will focus on far western Tibet, a region where this shift is believed to have led to significant changes in the subsistence economies of the peoples of the region, including famine, migrations, and major changes in political economy. This project will undertake a thorough examination of the causal forces behind monsoon variability as well as a comprehensive documentation of the variety of responses made by human institutions (ranging in scale from the household to the regional polity) to variation in monsoon intensity and character at different temporal scales. <br/><br/>The project will enhance basic understanding of both natural climate variability and the impact of this variability on human institutions. Although focusing on Tibet, this project will provide new insights into long-term interaction between climate systems and people throughout the Himalayan region. The project will promote teaching, training and learning by building new partnerships among universities, disciplines, and researchers in the United States, China and Tibet. It will integrate both research and education through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students. Each project team leader will encourage participating students to work directly with every aspect of the project, including field research, thus enabling them to obtain a richer experience than would be possible by working only within a single discipline. An award resulting from the FY 2005 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) supports this project.

These processes vary with time and space. Effective management<br/>of water resources requires deep understanding of these processes. Due to the lack of data or the<br/>difficulties in measuring R and BF, however, our current knowledge and understanding of these complex<br/>processes are very limited, especially about their temporal and spatial variations. Various assumptions are<br/>made about spatial variations of R in existing studies and little attention has been given to temporal<br/>variations of R and BF. While it is difficult to measure R and BF, it is relatively easy to measure the water<br/>levels in observation wells (h) and runoff in rivers. Extensive groundwater level data sampled at various<br/>time intervals over periods of years or decades are often available. Fluctuations of the water table in a<br/>groundwater system are dynamic responses of the system to its recharge and discharge, and thus contain<br/>significant amount of information about the recharge and discharge. Our preliminary analyses of the<br/>observed water levels in seven monitoring wells at the Walnut Creek watershed of Iowa indicate that<br/>fluctuations of the groundwater levels is a temporal fractal whose fractal dimension (D) varies spatially.<br/>Baseflow from this and other four watersheds also behaves as a temporal fractal and, more importantly,<br/>has a transition time or break in scaling.<br/>Our objectives are: 1) to determine existence of fractal scaling of groundwater level and baseflow and<br/>their relationship with recharge; 2) to identify physical causes behind fractal scaling; 3) to study the effects<br/>of aquifers' physical heterogeneity on fluctuations of groundwater level, recharge, and discharge and on<br/>their scaling, and 4) to investigate the nature of groundwater recharge process. These objectives will be<br/>reached by testing six hypotheses. These hypotheses will be tested by collecting and analyzing the longterm<br/>groundwater level measurements in 42 monitoring wells in 6 groundwater regions and the<br/>streamflow at 58 gauge stations in 11 hydrological units over a period of 50 - 100 years at the USGG<br/>website, and by conducting an integrated hydrologic modeling (IHM), stochastic analyses, and numerical<br/>simulations. With data mining we will use the extensive data collected by USGS over the years to identify<br/>the existence of the temporal scaling. With IHM we will be able to assess impacts of temporal and spatial<br/>variations of P, ET, and ? on fluctuations of h and BF. With stochastic analyses and numerical<br/>simulations, we will investigate effects of spatial variations of aquifers' physical properties on the<br/>temporal variations of h and BF and their scaling as well as the nature of R process.<br/>The intellectual merits. The most important merits of this research are to find the temporal scaling of h<br/>and BF and to provide physical causes behind the scaling. Temporal scaling of h may be pervasive in<br/>many aquifers as we show in this proposal by the spectra of the longest water level data in 14 USGS wells.<br/>There may be a simple explanation for the scaling: fluctuations of groundwater levels are due to various<br/>contributing hydrological variables (e.g., P, ET, and ?) with differing time and/or spatial scales. As a<br/>result, there is no characteristic time scale in the head fluctuations! We are anxious to do further<br/>investigation. Whether processes in the natural world are dependent or independent of the scale at which<br/>they operate is one of the major issues in hydrologic science . (Sposito, 1998). There has been a significant<br/>effort in searching for scaling in hydrology since an invariance property across scales as a fundamental<br/>should guide data analysis and modeling methods (NRC, 1991). Significant progresses in searching spatial<br/>scale invariance have been made during the last decade in hydrology. However, less attention was given to<br/>temporal scaling of subsurface hydrological variables. We have proposed a relatively new direction of<br/>stochastic research, as summarized by the panel on the original proposal, and are trying to make a forward<br/>step in application of stochastic approaches. The broad impacts include: 1) use of abundant groundwater<br/>level and streamflow data in trying to understand the patterns of temporal variations of h and BF make the<br/>methods and results of the proposed research widely applicable, 2) the proposed research is closely related<br/>to the NSF initiative: Water Cycle Research, 3) the knowledge obtained in this research is needed in longterm<br/>management and planning of water resources and in dealing with climate changes, 4) A current Ph.D.<br/>student is working on this topic. Two new students (one graduate and one undergraduate) will participate<br/>in this project if the proposal is funded, 5) Several publications are expected from this research as two<br/>papers have been written (one published and another submitted recently) based on our preliminary results.<br/>Finally, we want to say that addressing the comments made by the reviewers and panel on the original and<br/>second-submission of this proposal has greatly improved the proposal."

These trials allow for the indeterminate civil confinement of sexual offenders after they have completed their incarceration, based on whether offenders suffers from a statutorily described mental illnesses and whether they are likely to be a continuing danger to society. To date, only one experimental study has examined the impact of psychological expert testimony on juror decision-making in this context. The present studies are designed to build on the PI's previous theoretical and experimental work investigating the effects of psychological expert testimony on dangerousness in capital sentencing and extend it to sexual violent predator adjudications. Previous research found that mock jurors were more influenced by less scientific expert testimony and that standard adversary procedures did not remove this bias. Additional research suggested that Epstein's Cognitive Experiential Self theory (CEST) may offer an explanation for this bias, and means to counteract jurors' bias allowing jurors to more appropriately weigh more scientific testimony. For the present studies, three types of psychological expert testimony (i.e., pure clinical, actuarial, and guided professional judgment) will be created based on real trial transcripts, and will be transformed into a scripted videotape simulation. This simulation will be presented to both college student mock jurors and more representative juries who will deliberate in their decision-making. The ability of jurors and juries to properly weight the manipulated expert testimony throughout the trial process will be assessed, and the effectiveness of CEST theory, legally practical CEST manipulations, and pre-existing personality characteristics to affect juror decision-making will be measured The proposed research will have broad impact on undergraduate teaching, the college, underrepresented groups' involvement in research, the psychological and legal research communities, and society. Undergraduates will be primarily responsible for collecting the data for these experiments, and an advanced psychology and law class (psych 190) will use this research program as its main topic. Student authored presentations at major conferences will likely result from this student participation, an extraordinary opportunity for students at a primarily teaching-focused institution. The project investigators will disseminate the results of this study broadly to the psychological and legal community through law reviews and peer reviewed scientific journals, and presentations at interdisciplinary conferences. The studies results will have a substantial impact in the psychological community, informing the existing debate concerning appropriate evaluative tools for dangerousness evaluations and informing the theoretical literature on how jurors process expert testimony."

The frustules of growing diatoms and their organic template record the environmental conditions in which they grow. Once frustules sink and become sediment, paleoceanographers are able to use their chemical and isotopic composition to study past nutrient utilization (15N/14N ratio) and productivity (13C/12C ratio), as well as determine the radiocarbon age of sedimentary frustules. Currently, sedimentary frustules are physically isolated and chemically cleaned prior to the analysis of the elemental and isotopic composition of bulk organic matter associated with the frustules. Unfortunately, the records that have been through these prevailing methods have lead to ambiguous reconstructions of past oceanographic environments. <br/><br/>For this reason, researchers at the University of Washington and Oregon State University will develop several new, more reliable methods for analyzing the molecular and isotopic signatures of organic matter associated with diatom frustules. Specifically, the team of scientists will characterize the organic matter in diatoms frustules from cultures, plankton tows and sediments by using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The influence of frustule-cleaning and partial dissolution on frustule-bound organic compounds and the absolute relative abundance of biomarkers in frustules under iron limited and iron replete conditions will also be examined. In addition, the team of researchers will also purify individual frustule-bound biomarkers. By improving the methods for analyzing the molecular and isotopic signature of organic matter associated with diatom frustules, the dating of diatom-rich samples of Holocene age will be more accurate, the core integrity will be properly assessed, and the methods for measuring 13C/12C, 15N/14N and C/N ratios in diatom frustules will be improved. <br/><br/>As regards broader impacts, the work will not only open up entirely new avenues in paleoceanography, but also lead to a better understanding of past climate conditions and the ocean's biogeochemical cycles response to future anthropogenic impacts. The project will also provide for the support and training of one female graduate student and one or two undergraduate students."

Parasitic wasps are such non-stinging insects that save the U.S. and other governments hundreds of millions of dollars each year by ridding the environment of agricultural and forest pest insects. The female wasp lays her eggs on or in the bodies of insect or spider hosts. After hatching, wasp maggots feed on the host, eventually killing it. Unfortunately, biological information about these wasps is lacking in the scientific community. Only one species of Tetrasphaeropyx Cresson (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is known. The goal of this research is to discover and disseminate biological data about all Tetrasphaeropyx species. The Principal Investigator (PI) of this study has acquired 942 Tetrasphaeropyx specimens from 12 major North American museums and estimates that there may be a minimum of 60 new species yet to be described. All examined specimens with recorded host associations exclusively parasitize inchworm caterpillars which feed on forest trees and agricultural plants in North America. Methods for accomplishing this study are as follows. Over about 2 years, all specimens will be sorted into species. A digital image library is being built using a Leica 12.5 MZ stereomicroscope, a Syncroscopy digitalized imaging system, and an IBM Intellistation M Pro computer, with Adobe Photoshop software. During this period a phylogenetic hypothesis, or hypothesis of the natural history of the group will be developed. The species concept for the group will be refined in the process; thus, the phylogenetic analysis will yield crucial information used to define species. An image library of diagnostic morphological characters for identifying species will be built for phylogenetic analysis and for building an identification key for all species. The identification key will be accompanied with digitalized illustrations of diagnostic character states, and will itself be made accessible as a digitalized online key. A monograph of the biology, including host association information and species geographical ranges, taxonomy, and phylogeny of the group will be submitted for publication in a major scientific journal. <br/><br/>This investigation will provide important information about the parasitic wasp group Tetrasphaeropyx to entomologists, foresters, agriculturalists, conservation biologists, and others. It will offer an opportunity for training a graduate student and undergraduate students in insect taxonomy and evolution, as well as in technologies used for describing and classifying organisms. Thus, this project will begin training future scientists who will contribute to environmental conservation. Because of the tremendous species diversity of parasitic wasps, and the fact that each such group, in some cases each species, attacks a different kind of host, these insects are crucial in controlling potential insect pest population densities. As the group Tetrasphaeropyx becomes known, biologists will have a valuable tool for more accurately assessing biological diversity and habitat quality. It may provide an alternative to pesticides for managing potentially economically harmful outbreaks of inchworms."

The main idea is to employ a few time-evolving POD (proper orthogonal decomposition) modes to parametrize the slow manifold, and subsequently to advance the solution<br/>with a large time step using a Galerkin-free/equation-free procedure. This approach is fundamentally different from the standard Galerkin method used often to produce evolution equations for reduced order modeling. Specifically, the new method uses only bursts of full simulations based on the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) and available experimental data, providing in essence a ""closure-on-demand"", in order to perform an equation-free time evolution. In such multiscale approach, the full simulation through ROMS resolves the fine scales whereas the Galerkin-free/POD method - the coarse component - propagates with large time steps the most energetic modes of velocity, temperature and salinity and corresponding uncertainty fields.<br/>Preliminary simulations using realistic data for the Massachusetts Bay suggest that<br/>only a few modes are sufficient in describing the most interesting ocean dynamics, and that time steps of a few hours, instead of seconds or minutes, can be used in the Galerkin- free procedure. These results demonstrate feasibility of the proposed approach and imply that such fast predictions requiring very small computational cost and communications can indeed be performed on board of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Hence, these AUVs are endowed with navigation intelligence and true autonomy. This approach will be verified with full ROMS simulations and will be validated with three field experiments in the Cape Cod Bay. The final experiment in the third year of the<br/>program will demonstrate the DDDAS concept in ocean forecasting. The project will<br/>leverage the AUV fleet and other measurement resources as well as unique expertise for such missions of the MIT Sea Grant. The overall contribution of this project is a new paradigm in predicting the ocean state in real-time. Fundamental specific contributions include construction of time-dependent covariance kernels required in obtaining time-evolving POD modes; numerical analysis of the projective time-integration involved in the Galerkin-free multiscale procedure; representation of stochasticity via adaptive generalized polynomial chaos for uncertainty predictions; and rigorous protocols for data gathering in the ocean in the spirit of DDDAS."

In particular, it explores the operationalization of moral sanctions on the ground, as persons in the offshore financial services industry make judgments about potential clients that are meant to mitigate financial crime and money laundering. Since the 1990s, Caribbean states have attempted to bring state law regulating financial services into compliance with global norms proclaimed in international ""soft law:"" non-binding international principles, recommendations, and rules of conduct. The proposed research examines what happens after compliance has been achieved, by investigating potential transformations of global norms when local actors bring their own normative systems and judgments to the practices that constitute compliance and as they get incorporated into larger communities of interpretation. The PI hypothesizes that differently positioned agents muster different moral discourses and interpret emerging international norms differently as they go about the daily work involved in post-compliance regimes, and that this has the potential to reshape those international norms and the broader community that promulgates them. In particular, it hypothesizes that, in the Caribbean, a longstanding cultural form of moral evaluation -- the respectability/reputation dichotomy -- is shaping compliance with and transforming global discourse on tax competition. The proposed research will contribute to three areas of scholarly debate: a) the relevance of international soft law, transnational issue networks and global ethics to globalization; b) the comparative study of financial centers; and c) the anthropology of bureaucracy and finance. The proposed research will also contribute to policy debates about the regulation of finance, the fostering of global norms and moral sanctions when states resist international ""hard law"" in the name of national sovereignty, and money laundering interdiction. It will also advance teaching and training through the use of graduate research assistants who will learn archival methods and statistical procedures. The PI will also conduct a conference on new forms of regulation for international finance, to be held after the completion of this project, in order to facilitate multidisciplinary dialogue among scholars and policy advisors who conduct research on and are attempting to mitigate harmful tax competition."

This new disease has the potential to profoundly affect local vertebrate populations. Vertebrate populations (e.g., mice, squirrels, lizards), in turn, strongly influence risk of human exposure to Lyme disease (LD) via their impacts on numbers and infection of tick vectors. This research will integrate field, laboratory, and modeling efforts. First, a combination of field and lab studies will furnish information on individual host species' contributions to LD risk in California. Second, the abundance of specific groups of vertebrates will be compared in sites of high versus low SOD impact. Third, responses by specific hosts to SOD will be used to construct models to predict how SOD will change risk of human exposure to LD. Fourth, specific hypotheses arising from these models will be tested by assessing tick abundance and infection prevalence in areas of high and low SOD impact.<br/><br/>Our research embeds the ecology of the most prevalent vector-borne disease of humans in the United States (LD) within the ecology of a devastating infectious disease of plants (SOD), and specifically asks how these two disease systems interact. The outbreak of SOD presents a novel opportunity to determine how a human infectious disease is impacted by an exotic forest pathogen. Such research provides a model for current epidemics of plant pathogens and pests (e.g., beech bark disease, hemlock woolly adelgid, gypsy moth) that in all likelihood will dramatically change the composition of North American forests, with potentially strong consequences for human health."

The project aims at making fundamental contributions to the necessarily<br/>multidisciplinary systems required for data utilization in monitoring and control of interconnected<br/>engineering systems. The application that this proposal focuses on is the creation of new data-driven tools for electric power system operation and control. The applications systems include traditional SCADA systems as well as the emerging Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data concentrators. This effort will focus on five specific task areas: Distributed agent-based system monitoring; Pattern recognition and change detection; Dynamic analysis of signatures for early warning; Data-driven, low-order modeling for security assessment; Automated visualization for power system health monitoring. This work will provide a broader impact in several areas. First, the results in data manipulation, visualization, and processing will have application in other domains. Any complex system that relies heavily on measurements for monitoring and control shares the same need to extract key information from massive amounts of data received over wide areas and time scales. Second, several of the investigators work very closely with the electric power industry through the Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSERC), an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center designed to stimulate collaboration among 13 universities and 35 companies. Results from this project will naturally influence that collaboration in the form of seminars, tutorials, and interaction with industry."

Two opposing theories about why this might be are: <br/>Life first arose in a hydrothermal environment, possibly in the deep subsurface.<br/>Thermophiles preferentially survived the ""late heavy bombardment"" of the Hadean Earth. <br/>Since no sedimentary record survives from this period, it is not possible to address these theories directly through geology. Instead, we must look to modern geomicrobial processes to better understand controls on, and modes of, thermophilic life. Armed with this understanding, geological records may eventually yield more information on the physiological capabilities and nature of early life.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses geomicrobial processes at interfaces between mildly reducing hydrothermal fluids and oxidizing surface sediments or waters. Specifically, we will use a combination of molecular, chemical, and isotopic methods to identify the geomicrobial associations, metabolic strategies, nutrient, and energy requirements and geochemical signatures of streamer and biofilm-forming communities (SBC) of thermophilic and chemolithotrophic Bacteria and Archaea.<br/><br/>We will address the following questions:<br/>1) What is the physiochemical basis for the occurrence of biofilm-forming Aquificales? <br/>2) What is their primary carbon source and mode of carbon assimilation?<br/>3) What are the identities of the Crenarchaeota that appear to co-colonize these systems?<br/>4) Is there a co-dependence of these microbes and, if so, what is its basis?<br/>5) Can biosignatures be used to distinguish thermophilic and mesophilic communities?<br/>6) Might these systems leave a molecular record that could be traced back in time?<br/><br/>Scientific Merit: Through this research, we will learn more about the physiological basis for life at high temperatures and the characteristic biosignatures of thermophilic microbes. In particular, we will seek to discern if there is a symbiosis or simply a physical co-habitation of thermophilic Aquificales and Crenarchaea in the SBCs of Yellowstone National Park. These organisms occupy a special niche at the interface of hot, sub-subsurface hydrothermal fluids and a ""cold"" and oxidizing atmosphere. In seeking to increase understanding of microbes and biogeochemical processes operating at this interface and the strategies used to derive energy and nutrients, our proposal is firmly aligned with the aims and objectives of the Biogeosciences Program. In combining cutting-edge geochemical and microbiological approaches, we will also be generally improving methods and research techniques for the study of geomicrobial processes. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This proposal focuses on teaching and training and will support the training of a new postdoctoral investigator and graduate student at MIT and will provide unparalleled research opportunities for undergraduates interested in the biogeosciences, including significant collaborative interactions in the field and laboratory at three institutions. Providing meaningful and positive research experiences in multidisciplinary science to college undergraduates is critical to fostering the next generation of researchers and educators. Because the focal point of our research is one of the US's most visited national parks, there will be enhanced opportunities for public dissemination of our results. We will work directly with the Park Service to develop educational materials, including scientifically sound treatment of the philosophical and practical aspects of fundamental research pertaining to ""origins of life"" and ""limits of life"" concepts."

The main idea is to employ a few time-evolving POD (proper orthogonal decomposition) modes to parametrize the slow manifold, and subsequently to advance the solution<br/>with a large time step using a Galerkin-free/equation-free procedure. This approach is fundamentally different from the standard Galerkin method used often to produce evolution equations for reduced order modeling. Specifically, the new method uses only bursts of full simulations based on the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) and available experimental data, providing in essence a ""closure-on-demand"", in order to perform an equation-free time evolution. In such multiscale approach, the full simulation through ROMS resolves the fine scales whereas the Galerkin-free/POD method - the coarse component - propagates with large time steps the most energetic modes of velocity, temperature and salinity and corresponding uncertainty fields.<br/>Preliminary simulations using realistic data for the Massachusetts Bay suggest that<br/>only a few modes are sufficient in describing the most interesting ocean dynamics, and that time steps of a few hours, instead of seconds or minutes, can be used in the Galerkin- free procedure. These results demonstrate feasibility of the proposed approach and imply that such fast predictions requiring very small computational cost and communications can indeed be performed on board of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Hence, these AUVs are endowed with navigation intelligence and true autonomy. This approach will be verified with full ROMS simulations and will be validated with three field experiments in the Cape Cod Bay. The final experiment in the third year of the<br/>program will demonstrate the DDDAS concept in ocean forecasting. The project will<br/>leverage the AUV fleet and other measurement resources as well as unique expertise for such missions of the MIT Sea Grant. The overall contribution of this project is a new paradigm in predicting the ocean state in real-time. Fundamental specific contributions include construction of time-dependent covariance kernels required in obtaining time-evolving POD modes; numerical analysis of the projective time-integration involved in the Galerkin-free multiscale procedure; representation of stochasticity via adaptive generalized polynomial chaos for uncertainty predictions; and rigorous protocols for data gathering in the ocean in the spirit of DDDAS."

Coordination between conversants' movements and/or facial expressions can be observed when an action generated by one individual is predictive of a symmetric movement by another: symmetry formation. The interplay between such symmetry formation and subsequent symmetry breaking in nonverbal behavior is integral to the process of communication and is diagnostic of the dynamics of human social interaction. The PIs propose a model in which low level contributions from audition, vision, and proprioception (the perception of the angle of our joints) are combined in a mirror system that assists affective and semantic communication through the formation and breaking of symmetry between conversants' movements, facial expressions and vocal prosody. In the current project, naive participants will engage in dyadic (one-on-one) conversations with trained laboratory assistants over a closed-circuit video system that displays a computer reconstructed version of the lab assistant's head and face. Both the naive participant's and the lab assistant's motions, facial expressions, and vocalizations will be recorded. The visual and auditory stimuli available to the naive participant will be manipulated to provide specific hypothesis tests about the strength and timing of the effects of head movement, facial expression, and vocal prosody. The visual manipulation will be provided by a photorealistic reconstructed avatar head (i.e., a computer animation) driven partially by tracking the lab assistant's head and face, and partially from manipulation of timing and amplitude of the avatar's movement and facial expression. A combined differential equations and computational model for the dynamics of head movements and facial expression will be constructed and tested in real-time substitution for lab assistant's head motion or facial expression as realized by the avatar. The broader impact of this project falls into three main areas: enabling technology for the study of human and social dynamics, applications to the treatment of psychopathology, applications to human-computer interface design and educational technology. (1) These experiments will result in the advancement of methods for testing a wide variety of hypotheses in social interaction where the research question involves a manipulation of perceived social roles. (2) Automated analysis of facial expression provides on-line analysis of social interactions in small group, high stress settings in which emotion regulation is critical such as in residential psychiatric treatment centers and in psychotherapist-client interactions. The reliability, validity, and utility of psychiatric diagnosis, assessment of symptom severity, and response to treatment could be improved by efficient measurement of facial expression and related non-verbal behavior, such as head gesture and gaze. (3) Successful outcomes from the computational models may lead to the development of automated computer interfaces and tutoring systems that could respond to students' facial displays of confusion or understanding, and thereby guide more efficient instruction and learning."

This research completes earlier work by the PI on the subject of temptation and self-control and extends it in important new directions. The two main new directions are to consider guilt/virtuousness and nonlinear effects of temptation. Guilt, disutility associated with succumbing to temptation, is a natural issue in the context of temptation but has not been previously formalized. Virtuousness refers to the mirror image of guilt, feelings of pride in resisting temptation. The nonlinear effects to be considered concern situations where the level of temptation has a signi.cant e.ect on whether temptation is relevant to the agent. For example, perhaps a low level of temptation is entirely ignored, while a moderate degree of temptation entirely changes the choice problem as perceived by the decision maker.<br/><br/>Finally, the PI will use the tools developed in this context in new directions. First, adapting the model to multiple agents gives a way of thinking about the value of control rights and how agents view one another. In particular, this gives a natural<br/>language for considering altruism where, for example, a father may prefer letting his son make his own decisions. Second, the model lends itself naturally to considering other reasons why larger choice sets may be worse such a computational costs in choosing from a menu or regrets associated with not choosing ""correctly"" from the menu.<br/><br/>Broader impacts include funding graduate student research. Many of the directions proposed lead to research outside the traditional boundaries of economics and, consequently, may lead to fruitful interdisciplinary work. For example, it is natural to seek input from and collaboration with psychologists in considering such topics as guilt."

The faculty team is led by John Eichelberger, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Evgenii Gordeev, Institute of Volcanology and Seismology in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia, and Takehiro Koyaguchi, University of Tokyo, Japan. Volcanoes are among the most exciting and inspiring, as well as dangerous phenomena on the planet Earth and this project uses one of the most volcanically active regions of the world as a natural laboratory. Understanding volcanoes has become increasingly important as growing population and technical complexity of society make us more vulnerable to natural catastrophe and as we realize the role of volcanism in global change. By conducting an integrated comparison of these three especially violent analogous systems at different times since their eruptions over the last 50 years, this project will advance our understanding of how magma is stored in the crust, how eruptions are triggered, and how sector collapse affects future eruptive behavior. <br/><br/>The trinational collaboration is essential to carrying out the project analyses because the scientists from each nation will contribute different and complementary expertise. The collaboration continues and expands cooperation among U.S., Russian and Japanese institutions, and establishes the foundation for long-term research and training among these countries in the northern Pacific Rim. These efforts will enhance volcano hazard monitoring capabilities in the future by improving our understanding of the processes behind these large explosive eruptions and by training internationally-engaged young volcanologists. The project is notable for developing international research teams of faculty and students that will undertake field research in Kamchatka, in Alaska, and at Mount St. Helens. The graduate students will be trained in multiple approaches in geophysics, physical volcanology, modeling, and petrology. The students will also have language and culture training in Russian and will take short courses at Kamchatka State Pedagogical University with Russian and Japanese graduate students. This project will develop a cadre of scholars that are fluent in international collaborative approaches, with increased understanding of both the cultures and the cultures of science in the three nations. The teams will stay connected by frequent regular webcast seminars and meetings that will start before the field work and continue after field data is collected to ensure an integrated and collaborative analysis of the data.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Division of Earth Sciences."

The bay suffers from declines in dissolved oxygen, submersed aquatic vegetation, and finfish and shellfish fisheries. Nitrogen loading from adjacent lands is a key cause of this impairment. State and federal agencies have agreed to reduce nitrogen loading into the Bay by 40 percent before 2011. Much progress has been made in mitigating nitrogen loading from point sources, particularly agriculture and sewage treatment plants, and attention is now turning to non-point sources of nitrogen in the bay's watershed. On an area basis, urban and suburban lands contribute the most nutrients to the bay. The amount of nitrogen released to the bay is a product of interactions between hydrology, biology, chemistry, and social factors and therefore is an excellent integrator for understanding complexity in coupled natural-human ecosystems. The goal of this interdisciplinary research project is to investigate the links among landscape structure, nitrogen flux from urban watersheds, and the social and physical capacity to alter the landscape through vegetation management. A feedback loop linking these factors will be investigated. Urban designs that satisfy community preferences but also are aimed at reducing nitrogen loading will be investigated as a tool to close the feedback loop. The investigators will model how new architectural and landscape architectural designs alter landscape structure and therefore influence nitrogen export from urban and suburbanizing watersheds. They will work with managers to identify vegetation management options thought to minimize nitrogen loss from the land, and they will incorporate those options into new urban designs. The physical and social constraints on the ability of contrasting neighborhoods to adopt the prospective designs will be evaluated. The designs that prove to be adoptable by real communities will be included in models of altered metropolitan landscapes to predict the capacity of future landscape structure and associated management to prevent nitrogen flow to the bay.<br/><br/>This project will have important implications. First, it will employ and test a new integrated land-cover classification appropriate to complex, urban regions. Second, it will expand biocomplexity theory to include connections of ecological, hydrological, and social systems with the practice of urban design. Third, the project will test the current management strategy of reducing non-point nitrogen loading by modifying urban land cover. In addition, communities, primary and secondary schools, college students, graduate students, and post-docs will benefit from the project through employment, summer student internships and teacher fellowships, teacher workshops, after-school and summer programs, and development of curricular materials. These activities will link the research with under-represented populations and will promote a ""career ladder"" to expose members of these groups to environmental science professions. Outreach to federal, state, and local government managers, non-profit organizations, and community groups will focus on vegetation management and design options. The results of the project will be useful to citizen groups, environmental resource managers, and metropolitan planners. Visualizations of the contrasting models will help communities and planners evaluate scenarios for economic development, community revitalization, and ecological restoration. This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems."

Networks can therefore promote technological progress and consumer choice on the one hand, and are sources of trust in communities on the other hand. Our goal is to decompose the channels through which both of these phenomena operate. The PIs conduct two large field experiments with about 2,500 students at Harvard University. In the first study, they will provide samples of new and complex products such as PDA's to a randomly selected group of students. They will use various treatments including print and online advertising to obtain valid instruments for estimating interaction channels. By measuring both initial and final valuations as well as subjects' knowledge about the functionality of each product the research design can separate social learning, whether it be learning from information (strong social learning) or learning from observing friends' valuations (weak social learning), from social influence which changes preferences directly. <br/><br/>In the second learning project the PIs will generate private signals about the quality of four imaginary companies and then observe how subjects aggregate this information in the social network. By using the same subject pool we can further refine our model of social learning.<br/><br/>The last part of this project is a study of trust that will use field experiment techniques in Peru. We measure trust through a new microfinance program where borrowers can obtain low-interest rate loans by finding a sponsor from a predetermined set group of people in the community who are willing to cosign the loan. <br/><br/><br/>This research will help us to better understand how people learn from the experiences of others. The research design will allow the PIs to break this kind of ""social learning"" into two different pieces by measuring both outcomes and information transmission.

Previous work in two major polynyas (not influenced by rivers) showed that the flux of organic matter from the photic zone is high, yet strongly attenuated in the ""twilight zone."" Separate microbial work showed that sinking particles are colonized by an abundance of active bacteria, with hydrolytic activities as high in subzero waters as in warmer seas. Little information exists on specific bacteria associated with particles in the twilight zone of Arctic (or other marine) waters, with virtually none on how microbial diversity may relate to carbon flux in the ocean's interior or to differing inputs of marine and terrestrial carbon. This comparative research in several of the major polynyas of the Arctic system (two river-influenced, one not), in the same season over successive years, will help to develop a broader perspective on the possible changes in carbon cycling likely to result from a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean. The proposed research plan will characterize by modern molecular (or any) techniques the microbial communities that play a role in attenuating carbon flux. The success of this combined approach may prove valuable to evaluating aspects of carbon cycling elsewhere in the world oceans. Both principal investigators are dedicated educators, as well as researchers. In addition to providing graduate and undergraduate students with unique cross-disciplinary training, they will also be engaged in innovative shipboard programs, as part of a multi-national cooperative venture (NABOS), and the Canadian ArcticNet ""Schools on Board"" program dedicated to engaging indigenous communities in research by bringing in high school students to participate directly in research."

These activities will require integrated networks of instruments, sensors, robots, and vehicles to cooperate forming a ""digital ocean."" Underwater communication via propagating acoustic signals holds the best promise for reliable and general purpose wireless communications in the ocean. Significant advances have been made in recent years to establish physical layer point-to-point links in many types of ocean environments. Yet, the development of higher layer techniques suitable for the challenging characteristics of the ocean environment remains largely unexplored territory. Networking the ""digital ocean"" via underwater acoustic communications remains one of the formidable technical obstacles to the a fully networked ocean. Challenges to be overcome by underwater acoustic modem and network designers include: severely limited range-dependent bandwidth and attenuation, extensive time-varying multipath propagation, and low speed of sound propagation in water resulting in long propagation delays. For sensor network deployment, these features imply that asynchronous and adaptive networking must be considered, typical medium access control will not be feasible, deterministic algorithms may not be feasible due to the stochastic nature of underwater networks, and link quality prediction and estimation will be paramount to delivering the desired quality of service. Finally, distance-dependent bandwidth implies that everything from capacity analysis to medium access control must be redeveloped under these new constraints. Terrestrial sensor networks are typically distinguished by high node density, large amounts of potentially correlated sensed data, stringent limitations on system resources, and multiple sources of uncertainty. Underwater sensor networks have even stronger limitations. To achieve the goals of an undersea sensor network, the PIs propose to study the following: network topology optimization and estimation, channel & energy-aware routing, delay/disruption tolerant underwater networking, cross-layer designs which integrate underwater channel characteristics, impact of the underwater acoustic channel on scaling laws and fundamental limits, experimental validation of system concepts for underwater acoustic networking"

Such problems appear in oceanography, but also in meteorology, economics, engineering, and all fields in which complex simulations are carried out. Automatic differentiation (AD) tools have proved extremely powerful in determining model sensitivities to perturbations in initial and boundary conditions, as well as in internal parameters. AD is critical in recent efforts to bring these models into consistency with modern, massive global data sets (state estimation or ""data assimilation"" in meteorology). However, sensitivities alone are of limited value for characterizing model behavior. The proposed research on uncertainty quantification represents a qualitative advance in our understanding of the models and will ultimately guide model improvements; this requires new mathematical approaches for eigen-solvers, Hessian computations, and non-smooth optimization to handle the computationally complex models.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit This project seeks to gain deep new insight into geophysical models and the uncertainty inherent in the state estimation of geophysical systems. Without them it is impossible to attribute problems encountered in such models to either non-smooth formulation of the model numerics, or to theoretical limits of the underlying smooth dynamical system. However, significant advances are needed in the algorithms used for uncertainty quantification, which necessitate computing the eigen-solutions of the large, dense Hessians that characterize geophysical models. Substantial advances in automatic differentiation algorithms for computing Hessian-vector products, coupled with novel pre-conditioners based on quasi-Newton updates and scale probing are expected to enable an efficient characterization of the numerical uncertainties. Furthermore, advances in state estimation for highly discontinuous systems, achieved via the use of non-smooth optimization algorithms and corresponding advances in differentiation algorithms, will provide insight into the model uncertainties introduced through the use of non-smooth parameterization schemes. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts Numerical models are used in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems, including geophysics; economics; physics; mechanical, nuclear, aeronautical and chemical engineering; and medicine. The complexity of these models, which are typically used in simulation mode, increases over time until no single individual understands how and why the code responds to changes in external or internal parameters. The proposed mathematical algorithms and AD methods will produce sensitivity tests that are computationally feasible even in very large scale problems. Often, the model state simulations are combined with a wide variety of observations so as to produce best estimates of the true state. AD tools have proven extremely useful in enabling the resulting extremely large optimization problem to be solved by using gradient-based optimization algorithms. The proposed work addresses both discontinuities and nonlinearities in large scale models, offering insights that will benefit a wide class of problems where uncertainty quantification has previously been intractable. This project will provide the mathematical and computational tools so that researchers can evaluate model uncertainties in near-automatic fashion. To maximize their availability and impact all algorithms will be implemented as open source software."

Temperate glaciers slide<br/>when water pressures are high. As primary subglacial erosion mechanisms are attributable to<br/>sliding of the glacier over its bed, the spatial and temporal pattern of sliding, and of the<br/>subglacial drainage network that control it, are important to understand. The proposed research<br/>acts upon hypotheses generated in two recently completed NSF-supported grants in which 1) the<br/>sliding field on the small Alaskan Bench glacier was carefully documented using continuous<br/>differential GPS, reaching its maximum speed at times of highest water storage within the<br/>glacier, and 2) the annual outburst flood of Hidden Creek Lake beside the much larger Kennicott<br/>glacier was shown to greatly perturb the hydrologic system. The 400 m thickness of the<br/>Kennicott Glacier allows much more rapid collapse of the subglacial drainage network than on<br/>the 150 m thick Bench Glacier during times of low snowmelt input to the glacier surface. As the<br/>snowmelt input increases again, the subglacial plumbing system must re-grow, during which<br/>time it should re-pressurize, promoting another period of sliding. If this is the case, then glacial<br/>thickness emerges as a primary control on the total annual sliding of a glacier, and therefore on<br/>the ability of a glacier to erode the landscape. The proposed research takes advantage of the<br/>accessibility and size of this Kennicott Glacier to investigate in detail the sliding history of this<br/>large temperate glacier and its association with both the seasonally-evolving water storage and<br/>pressure fields, and the inevitable annual Hidden Creek outburst flood.<br/>In this pilot project, the following hypotheses will be tested, in the hope that the data<br/>generated will serve as proof that the work is both tractable and productive of insight into the<br/>system.<br/>* Short-lived sliding increases will occur during ice dammed lake outbursts.<br/>* Sliding anomalies at the Kennicott Glacier occur in association with synoptic variations in<br/>melt inputs.<br/>* Long, thick glaciers, like the Kennicott glacier, will experience both more total sliding than<br/>thin glaciers, and multiple sliding events within a single melt season.<br/>The data to be collected include time series of: glacier surface motion, using multiple GPS<br/>receivers on the glacier run in differential continuous mode; water inputs by snowmelt and<br/>outputs from the exit river to constrain evolution of the water balance; englacial water pressures<br/>at several locations along the subglacial flood route that take advantage of side-glacier lakes and<br/>moulins; water chemistry at the outlet stream. Taken together, this data will directly test an<br/>existing model of linked glacial dynamics and subglacial network evolution.<br/>Broader Impact. As the research will be accomplished near the Wrangell St Elias National<br/>Park's primary entrance near McCarthy, the research on the Kennicott Glacier is ideally situated<br/>to allow direct communication of both our scientific methods and results to the public. As in<br/>prior work, public talks will be given to national park visitors in formal seminars. Activities will<br/>be coordinated with the Wrangell Mountains Center, a private non-profit institute dedicated to<br/>education and research, through their Alaska Wildlands Studies, a 7-week field course accredited<br/>for college students through UC Santa Barbara. Guest lectures on principles and field techniques<br/>of glaciology and glacial geology will be given, and opportunities for involvement of its these<br/>students in the field work will be offered. The research will employ and train one Ph.D. student<br/>from CU, and at two undergraduate students."

The basic idea is simple: rather than mapping genes by studying crosses, one types a large number of unrelated individuals (1,152 in the present case) with respect to a large number of variable marker loci (6,144 in the present case) distributed across the genome, in order to identify chromosomal regions that appear to be shared by individuals that are phenotypically similar (in the sense of being resistant to a particular pathogen, for example). This approach potentially leads to much faster gene identification than traditional methods, but has only become practicable as a result of advances in technology for studying genetic variation.<br/><br/>The project is part of the effort to understand the genetic basis for phenotypic variation - arguably the greatest challenge facing modern biology, and central to genetic epidemiology (e.g., why some people are more susceptible to asthma), plant and animal breeding (e.g., why some strains of rice more tolerant to drought), as well as basic evolutionary biology (e.g., the kinds of genetic changes underlie adaptation to a novel habitat). While the project is directed toward the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the methods that will be developed are broadly applicable (including to humans). Furthermore, Arabidopsis is a model for plant biology, and is often used to study agriculturally important traits indirectly."

The successful construction and description of these autonomously moving molecules will generate both scientific and public interest, and these studies have the potential to lead to applications in areas such as drug delivery and nanopatterning. <br/><br/>Chemical Bonding Centers are designed to focus innovative collaborative efforts that address a ""big problem"" which will lead to a major advance in chemistry or at the interface of chemistry and other sciences and will have the potential to attract broad scientific and public interest."

The system is a cost-effective, distributed memory 64-bit parallel computer consisting of 48 nodes inter-connected by Gigabit networking. It will be a significant increase in the computing power currently in place within the Colleges of Engineering and Arts & Sciences, allowing a number of important cross-disciplinary topics to be investigated, including both fundamental and applied studies. Examples include: homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion, hydrodynamic stability and shock physics, biomedical transport phenomena, stratospheric ozone formation, and electric motor drive fault characterization and prediction. Future topics may also include extreme loading of large structural systems (e.g. earthquakes), antibiotic effects on ribosomal protein synthesis, transport in fuel cells, molecular quantum computers, bioinformatics, atmospheric fluid dynamics, force guided automated assembly and burst processes in cylinder-cylinder intersections. In addition to these research activities, this machine will be used as an integral component for several graduate and undergraduate courses, as well as for teaching and training students in areas such as scientific/high-performance computing, cluster management/operation, and parallel/distributed programming. The system will also be used as a recruiting tool for area middle and high school students, and use of the system will be offered to student organizations such as SWE, NSBE and SHPE to enrich their educational experience."

One of the main objectives is to compare toxicity of metals in the dissolved and nanoparticle state as well as the nanoparticles of different sizes and shape. The hypothesis is that the metal nanoparticles will produce toxic effects that are different from that of metals in aqueous solution.

In that context, this project concerns the nature of - and appropriate pedagogical response to - a pattern of thought that is, on the one hand, prerequisite to the development of scientific literacy but that, on the other hand, can be profoundly deleterious to the elaboration of a true scientific understanding of biological processes.<br/><br/>Teleo-functional reasoning explains entities and events in terms of the purposes that they serve. It is foundational to literacy in the life sciences because it distinguishes western schooled adults' conceptions of biological versus non-biological natural phenomena: While adults view entities such as nostrils as existing ""for"" particular functions (e.g., breathing), they tend to view entities such as caves as purposeless even though they perform many activities (e.g., producing stalagmites). However, despite their centrality to drawing a basic scientific distinction, most non-experts' specific ideas about function are an obstacle to biological understanding. This is because they are motivated by a mistaken view of natural selection as a goal-directed process akin to intentional design rather than as a blind mechanism. Understanding the origins of this scientific misconstrual, and designing effective curricular materials to counter it as early as possible, is therefore crucial to the promotion of lifelong literacy and learning in biology.<br/><br/>To that end, the goal of this research is to empirically explore the nature of young children's teleo-functional intuitions as they enter the formative years of their scientific schooling, and to use this empirical foundation as the basis for an innovative, exploratory educational intervention to teach 5- to 8-year-old children natural selection. This emphasis occurs in response to several recent findings indicating the need for such work. First, current studies suggest that until well into elementary school, children appear to construe all kinds of living and non-living entities - clocks, lions, ponds, mountains, clouds and their properties - as existing for a purpose (DiYanni & Kelemen, 2005a; Kelemen, 1999ab, 2003; but see Keil, 1992). In consequence, unlike adults, pre- and elementary school children do not seem to differentiate living from non-living natural phenomena along teleo-functional lines. Second, research also suggests that young children's purpose-based attributions are motivated by intuitions that natural phenomena are products of intentional design (Piaget, 1929; Evans, 2000a, 2001; Kelemen, 2004). As a result, young children therefore already show the hallmarks of reasoning patterns recognized as persistent impediments to a scientific understanding of biology.<br/><br/>In exploring possible reasons why children possess such intuitions plus potential instructional responses to these ideas, this research is intended as the initial step in a larger research program that, in partnership with early childhood educators, and an expert international advisory panel of inter-disciplinary researchers, seeks to directly apply methods and insights from cognitive developmental research to the design of innovative and empirically informed early scientific instruction."

It addresses the societal concerns and legal concerns raised by patents involving nanotechnology. The possibility of obtaining patent rights provides an incentive for academic researchers, government researchers, and companies for innovation in nanotechnology, just as pharmaceuticals have been developed because of a similar incentive. Yet nanotechnologies raise issues for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and its international counterparts, which this project will explore. Some of those issues are analogous to those encountered by any dramatically new technology for which patent protection is sought. Other issues are unique, however, because of the extraordinary characteristics of nanotechnology. Just as there may be problems in the scientific development of a technology, there may be problems in the legal system's response to that technology. The purpose of this project is to identify existing problems with the patent system's response to nanotechnology, predict future problems, and offer policy solutions. The project will consist of (1) legal analyses of patent statutes, treaties, and court decisions that apply to nanotechnologies; (2) legal and social analyses of problems that have previously occurred in the application of patent policies to other new technologies (such as computer programs and patents on genetic technologies) and predictions of whether those problems are likely to occur with nanotechnologies; (3) identification of unique problems that nanotechnology will create for the patent system (such as whether a nano-version of an existing substance satisfies the patent requirement of novelty); and (4) analyses of potential policy solutions. This year-long project will be the first comprehensive analysis of the application of patent policy to nanotechnology. Thus, it will provide a significant advance over the existing literature and its results will be of interest and educational value to scientific researchers, businesses, lawyers, academics, judges, policymakers, legislators, and others involved in this field. A senior and junior legal scholar, and two graduate students will undertake the research and present the findings. Thus, this proposed project meets the goals of the program involving ""Societal and Educational Implications of Scientific and Technological Advances on the Nanoscale."""

Coordination between conversants' movements and/or facial expressions can be observed when an action generated by one individual is predictive of a symmetric movement by another: symmetry formation. The interplay between such symmetry formation and subsequent symmetry breaking in nonverbal behavior is integral to the process of communication and is diagnostic of the dynamics of human social interaction. The PIs propose a model in which low level contributions from audition, vision, and proprioception (the perception of the angle of our joints) are combined in a mirror system that assists affective and semantic communication through the formation and breaking of symmetry between conversants' movements, facial expressions and vocal prosody. In the current project, naive participants will engage in dyadic (one-on-one) conversations with trained laboratory assistants over a closed-circuit video system that displays a computer reconstructed version of the lab assistant's head and face. Both the naive participant's and the lab assistant's motions, facial expressions, and vocalizations will be recorded. The visual and auditory stimuli available to the naive participant will be manipulated to provide specific hypothesis tests about the strength and timing of the effects of head movement, facial expression, and vocal prosody. The visual manipulation will be provided by a photorealistic reconstructed avatar head (i.e., a computer animation) driven partially by tracking the lab assistant's head and face, and partially from manipulation of timing and amplitude of the avatar's movement and facial expression. A combined differential equations and computational model for the dynamics of head movements and facial expression will be constructed and tested in real-time substitution for lab assistant's head motion or facial expression as realized by the avatar. The broader impact of this project falls into three main areas: enabling technology for the study of human and social dynamics, applications to the treatment of psychopathology, applications to human-computer interface design and educational technology. (1) These experiments will result in the advancement of methods for testing a wide variety of hypotheses in social interaction where the research question involves a manipulation of perceived social roles. (2) Automated analysis of facial expression provides on-line analysis of social interactions in small group, high stress settings in which emotion regulation is critical such as in residential psychiatric treatment centers and in psychotherapist-client interactions. The reliability, validity, and utility of psychiatric diagnosis, assessment of symptom severity, and response to treatment could be improved by efficient measurement of facial expression and related non-verbal behavior, such as head gesture and gaze. (3) Successful outcomes from the computational models may lead to the development of automated computer interfaces and tutoring systems that could respond to students' facial displays of confusion or understanding, and thereby guide more efficient instruction and learning."

The pulsed EPR spectrometer will be able to provide structural information that is only accessible using advanced EPR techniques such as ENDOR (electron-nuclear double resonance) spectroscopy and ESEEM (electron spin echo envelope modulation) spectroscopy. EPR is used to detect molecules and sites in materials that contain unpaired electrons such as those that exist in the biologically important transition metals iron, cobalt, copper, nickel and manganese; in light-induced radicals in photosynthetic systems; in solid catalysts comprised of pyrolytic carbon or metal oxides with or without additional transition metals; and in permanent spin labels and spin traps that can be introduced into organic and biological molecules as probes. When used to its fullest capacity, EPR is an advanced structural tool (similar in principle to NMR spectroscopy) that can be applied to large molecules in frozen or liquid solution (unlike X-ray crystallography, which requires high-quality crystals) or to solid materials such as catalysts and adsorbents, with no size limit (unlike NMR spectroscopy, which, with certain exceptions, can only be performed on macromolecules below a certain mass). Ongoing projects affected by the acquisition of this instrument include: 1) Identification of Protein Factors that Influence the Redox Potentials of Organic Cofactors in Photosynthetic Systems; 2) Detection of Metallated Artificial Oligopeptide-DNA; 3) Study of Protein-Bound Radicals in Biological Systems; 4) Experimental and Theoretical Studies of Thiolate-Heme Enzymes; and 5) Elucidation of Lipoic Acid Biosynthesis and Study of Serine Deaminase. <br/><br/>Some of the societal benefits of the research to be conducted with this instrument include: 1) A better understanding of oxygen transfer chemistry in thiolate-ligated heme-proteins, which could result in improved catalysts for industrial applications. The thiolate-ligated heme enzymes to be studied use only electrons, protons, and dioxygen (or peroxide) to oxidize substrates. The only by-product is water. Thus, these enzymes are particularly ""green"" catalysts, and synthetic systems that could mimic their chemistry would be of obvious value. 2) A better understanding of the biochemistry of ribonucleotide reductase. This enzyme has central importance in human health. 3) Insight into the design and fabrication of a biological/organic hybrid electrochemical half-cell that couples Photosystem I with hydrogenases to generate hydrogen gas using sunlight. This long-term goal would lead to a ""green"" method of generating hydrogen gas using sunlight alone.<br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students will be educated and trained in advanced EPR with the new instrumentation. They will be exposed to interdisciplinary research at the border of chemistry and biology. Students will learn advanced spectroscopic techniques as well as molecular biology and computational methods. This award will broaden the access of underrepresented groups to advanced instrumentation. The PIs have ongoing collaborations with faculty at local undergraduate colleges. Research undergraduates at Susquehanna University, for example, carry out biological research at their home institution during the school year and perform EPR spectroscopy at Penn State during the summer."

This workshop is the 6th in a series extending back to 1974 that are held at irregular intervals. The last two workshops, held, in 1993 and 2000, were hosted in Japan. At the first meeting of the International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences (IPICS), held in March of 2004, it was verified that the next workshop would be held in the United States. This proposal addresses that decision. An international workshop on ice-drilling technology in 2006 is particularly well timed due to the unprecedented number of successful deep-drilling projects that have been completed since the time of the last workshop in 2000, and the proliferation of shallow and medium-depth core recovery activities that have also been concluded successfully during this time. Ice coring technologies are currently in a state of rapid evolution due to the experience gained in the numerous recent deep drilling programs, the planning and development of a new deep-capacity drill system in the United States, and the requirements for new science activities that are pushing the limits of known, demonstrated drilling capabilities. This workshop will provide the opportunity for entities currently engaged in ice drilling and coring activities to share the results of the most recent projects and present their solutions to challenges encountered in the field during drilling operations. Participants will also benefit by learning from each other about planned activities and future challenges that will result from new activities that have never been attempted before (e.g. subglacial lake drilling). The broader impacts of the workshop involve the opportunity for the drilling community to continue discussions on shared and collaborative activities that will permit the effective transfer of new technologies to the world-wide community and to seek opportunities for new joint or shared activities that will potentially lead to a more global approach to the proliferation of best technologies in this field."

Given recent developments in the underlying science and required technology, the project provides for the first time a realistic chance at addressing these two complex applications. In turbulence control, computational power now allows direct simulation of turbulent flows, as well as the promise of model-based control approaches. Second, the advent of MEMS technology makes it possible to envisage sensors and actuators that can work at the scale of turbulence-producing coherent structures, which can be on the order of 100-1000 um. Finally, a better fundamental understanding of these coherent structures has recently been achieved. In measuring and controlling particle populations, the project will integrate computational and measurement capability to analyze video microscopy images in real time to determine particle size and shape distributions. By manipulating environmental variables such as pH, impurity concentration, and temperature, we can influence the evolving particle shape, which can be used as a marker for crystal structure (enabling polymorph control) in pharmaceutical applications.<br/><br/>The applications chosen are ideal for developing DDDAS tools because of the following features: complex models with large numbers of degrees of freedom, high complexity measurements, significant sources of noise and uncertainty, and significant industrial and economic impact. The research conducted under this project will develop and demonstrate the state estimation method known as moving horizon estimation as the algorithm for assimilating in real time the data and dynamic, nonlinear model, and will develop and implement the autocovariance least squares method for identifying the disturbance structures from the measurement data and models. By identifying the disturbance structures from data, the derived models do not have to be perfect in order to represent and predict the data accurately and enable model-based feedback control. The project will develop the new optimization tools that are required to enable state estimation, disturbance identification, and model-based feedback control. Industrial collaborations and participation in industrial consortia provide ample opportunities for technology transfer of the state estimation and model predictive control (ExxonMobil, Eastman Chemical, Shell), video imaging (MettlerToledo), and crystal size and shape distribution control (Mitsubishi and GlaxoSmithKline)."

These fluctuations, often called mast seeding, directly affect numerous plant and animal species. Nonetheless, empirical tests of the proximate causes of mast seeding are virtually nonexistent. Crone and Sala will test proximate mechanisms of mast seeding in two plant species: Astragalus scaphoides (bitterroot milkvetch), a bee-pollinated wildflower, and Pinus albicaulis (whitebark pine), a wind-pollinated tree. For each species, Crone and Sala will test whether pollen availability limits seed production, and the effect of seed production on stored resources. These experiments test the assumptions of ""pollen coupling"" a recently proposed, but untested, hypothesis for how mast-seeding occurs. Crone and Sala will also evaluate predictions of pollen coupling models, using wide-scale geographic patterns of synchrony in whitebark pine and whole-plant manipulations of fruit set and pollen availability in bitterroot milkvetch. <br/><br/>Fluctuations in the fruit or seed output of mast-seeding plants are a key factor regulating economically important wildlife and pest species. Whitebark pine exemplifies the importance of understanding mast seeding for management. In Yellowstone National Park, whitebark cone crop failures cause human-grizzly conflicts; managers need to predict non-mast years in order to deal with these conflicts and associated public relations. In Glacier National Park, whitebark pine has been decimated by an introduced pathogen, white pine blister rust. Predicting mast years will help managers locate and collect seeds of resistant trees, and design restoration strategies that maintain key elements of mast-seeding. In addition to direct application of research results, this project will provide educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and integrate with ongoing programs that provide research opportunities for inner-city and Native American undergraduate students."

The goal of this project is to engineer homing endonucleases with novel functions that harness the extreme target specificity of these proteins. The PI-SceI homing endonuclease recognizes a single target site within the 13 million base-pair yeast genome. One objective of this research is to modify PI-SceI to create altered specificity endonucleases that recognize different target sites. This will be done by coupling rational-design, based on the X-ray crystal structure of the PI-SceI/DNA complex, with a combinatorial genetic selection strategy. Another aim is to elucidate how altered specificity occurs in nature by analyzing PI-SceI analogues from other yeast strains. This will reveal how the specificity determinants of homing endonucleases evolve over time. The project will also involve introducing caged ligands into PI-SceI in order to generate novel artificial enzymes whose endonucleolytic activities can be triggered in response to ultraviolet irradiation. These variants will permit the temporal and spatial regulation of the enzymatic activity.<br/><br/>Broader impact: An important benefit of the described projects will be that they will form the basis for the training of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in scientific research. The availability of PI-SceI and of novel site-specific endonucleases that target specific genomic sequences will facilitate the study of DNA repair in complex organisms and provide the molecular tools required for gene targeting methods. Moreover, the photoactivated homing endonuclease that will be developed may become an important commercial technology."

Accurate flux parameterizations are particularly important at high wind conditions as demonstrated by recent hurricane prediction model studies. Yet, ther present air-sea flux parameterizations in the operational models are based on simple bulk formulas and are clearly far from satisfactory. Increasing observational evidences suggest that air-sea fluxes strongly depend on sea states. Recently, the lead investigator and his colleagues have developed a new model of the wave boundary layer (the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer that is directly influenced by surface waves) based on the fundamental principles of conservation of energy and momentum across the boundary layer. The model has been coupled with surface wave models to predict the equivalent surface roughness and the drag coefficient over mature, growing, and complex seas. In particular, the model predicts reduced levels of the drag coefficient at very high winds under hurricane conditions, consistent with recent field and laboratory observations. One shortcoming of the present model is that it does not include the effect of surface breaking waves on the wave boundary layer.<br/><br/>The proposed model of the wave boundary layer and the equilibrium wave spectrum will be based on the following hypotheses: (1) Breaking waves significantly modify the structure of the wave boundary layer and the resulting air-sea momentum flux under strong wind forcing. (2) Breaking wave effects on the air-sea momentum flux can be quantified accurately if the existing wave boundary layer model is extended to incorporate the effect of the form drag due to breaking wave crests and the effect of airflow separation behind breaking wave crests that effectively shelters shorter waves from direct wind forcing (spatial sheltering effect), provided the surface wave spectrum and the breaking wave statistics are known. (3) In the equilibrium range, the surface wave spectrum and the breaking wave statistics may also be predicted together with the air-sea momentum flux. The model will explicitly include the form drag and airflow separation effects and will be used to predict the drag coefficient under high wind conditions. Next, each component of the model will be validated against new laboratory observations carried out at the University of Miami. The experiment is specifically designed for the model validation and provides simultaneous measurements of the total wind stress, the surface viscous stress, the surface wave spectrum, and the breaking wave statistics. The proposed development will be done in close collaboration with Stephen Belcher at the university of Reading, UK. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed study of the wave boundary layer and the equilibrium wave spectrum will be an important and essential step towards our ultimate goal of developing a new set of parameterizations of air-sea fluxes, which will be valid for the whole range of wind speeds and surface wave conditions and can be used as improved boundary conditions for high-resolution numerical models of ocean, atmosphere, and coupled ocean/atmosphere systems, including the tropical cyclone prediction models. Therefore, this research addresses social needs to improve weather forecast (in particular, tropical cyclone forecast) and to reduce natural hazards caused by extreme wind and wave conditions. The project includes the development of a new experimental technique to estimate the breaking wave statistics. Quantifying surface breaking wave events is extremely important for all aspects of the air-sea interaction studies. The project also involves the education and training of one graduate student. The student will learn both laboratory experimental techniques and theoretical/numerical modeling approaches to study breaking wave effects on air-sea interaction processes. Finally, an existing international collaboration will be fostered."

The goal of this project is to experimentally test the hypothesis that food abundance controls short-term evolutionary changes in juvenile growth rates and the timing of spring breeding by mimicking high food conditions in three populations of red squirrels. Experimentally induced evolution would confirm the importance of food as a key factor affecting short-term evolution in red squirrels. <br/><br/>More broadly, this project will generate insights into the crucial linkages between ecology and contemporary evolution in the wild. The Kluane red squirrel system will continue to provide a valuable venue for graduate and undergraduate training in field research in northern ecosystems.

A previous project has developed a web-based robotic observatory (URSA), now in use by 500 undergraduate students per year, mostly in introductory classes. Advanced students need improved observational capabilities for their more difficult projects. Because of the limited angular resolution and bright sky background of the URSA telescope, which is situated in the middle of Fayetteville, AR, a much larger and more capable webscope has been fully funded and is now being commissioned at a dark-sky site in New Mexico (the NFO WebScope). Other educational partners in this venture are the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, the Arkansas School for Mathematics & Sciences, and the NF/ Observatory in New Mexico. <br/><br/>This project builds on experience from the prior URSA project to create a simple NFO user interface and adapt and implement effective educational materials for the new advanced curriculum. The telescope is also being used for student-faculty research projects. Students in the revised upper level classes are expected to show improved learning and enthusiasm for astronomy. These improvements are being measured by pre- and post-testing with concept tests, formative evaluations of attitudes and opinions, Purdue course evaluation forms, class grades, and exit interviews by the Department Chairperson. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The results of this study are made available to others through several avenues, including presentations at conferences, publications in professional research and educational journals, and a web site. In addition, annual summer Astronomy Research Experience for Teachers workshops are being organized to introduce in-service middle-school and high-school science teachers to the advantages of teaching with robotic astronomy. These teachers and their students are then given access to the webscopes and training in their use. Other astronomers have expressed interest in the first results of this work, and the lessons learned from these implementation experiences may benefit the teaching of astronomy at all undergraduate levels."

BioPAX is an emerging standard for the representation of biological pathway data exchange such as metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory networks. It is an ontology written in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) that describes genes, proteins, enzymes, and small molecules. Statements in OWL have a precise meaning and the strong formalism enables a collection of statements made in OWL to be reasoned over, as well as checked for consistency and contradictions. Instance Store takes an ontology and the data it describes formally in OWL and uses reasoning technology to ask question and make inferences about these data. Using the two technologies together should enable seamless integration of a number of data sources and facilitate the creation of tools. <br/><br/><br/>Understanding and reasoning over pathway data will enhance life science and medical research, as well as environmental research such as bioremediation.

Modeling of the in-service performance of thermoplastic-matrix woven-fabric reinforced structural composites - e.g., damage tolerance, crashworthiness, vibration - is currently inadequate for parts of any geometric complexity because of the inability of existing performance models to capture the true deformed material properties. The key to taking advantage of the reduced weight and potentially increased occupant safety that these composites can offer is to provide a direct link between part geometry, material selection, process conditions, process-induced local properties, and part performance, thereby allowing informed feedback to the design process. The capabilities of the predictive model will be demonstrated by considering a prototype part from design conception, to manufacturing under a set of prescribed conditions, through seamlessly examining its in-service performance. This research is being cosponsored by the DOE Freedom Car Project. <br/><br/>The availability of a predictive model that can be widely used by industry will facilitate the greater use of lightweight composite materials in the automotive industry, increasing fuel-efficiency without sacrificing safety.

In the former, a particle is driven by its interaction with the non-homogeneous random medium, while in the latter, the particle interacts with other particles present. In the general RWRE model an environment is a collection of transition probabilities between lattice sites, and it is chosen from some mixing shift-invariant distribution. On the other hand, a class of deposition models, introduced by the first PI, not only provides a unified framework for many well-known particle systems, but also gives a broader view on common phenomena arising in such systems. An object of vital importance in particle systems, in spirit similar to a random walker in random environment, is the so-called second class particle. The main goal of these fields is the understanding of the consequences of the randomness in the environment, or caused by particle-particle interactions, respectively. Among the fundamental questions one can consider are the existence of 0-1 laws, law of large numbers, central limit theorems, large deviations, etc. The two fields are very close in spirit and ideas, just as an example, non-reversibility is a major obstacle in both fields to common applications. Sometimes even direct connections can be established between the two fields through different representations of the same system. This research contains an instance where a surface growth process is shown to be the dual of a RWRE model, allowing the flow of results from the latter to the former. Dual connections within the field of interacting systems are known to be a powerful tool. Analogously, drawing parallels between interacting systems and RWRE's allows for the exchange of methods, insights, and results.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that probabilistic intuition and techniques are often of great relevance to other areas of mathematics, this research has a direct impact on probability theory, combinatorics, statistical physics, and the theory of partial differential equations. The fields of random media and interacting systems also have various industrial, agricultural, sociological, and biological applications. Moreover the methods and problems in these fields are often easy to state, while the solutions involve sophisticated tools. This makes the subject appealing to graduate students and young researchers, generating more interest in probability theory."

Past research by Williams and others demonstrates two paradoxical effects of ostracism: pro-social responses and anti-social responses. Although people respond pro-socially to ostracism for example by altering their unacceptable behavior, there are also instances in which ostracized individuals react violently, such as recent instances of school shooters. This research proposes to examine empirically the conditions under which ostracism leads to aggressive or anti-social tendencies and responses. First, ostracism is proposed to increase negative emotions and retaliatory response tendencies as a first-level reflexive response, which is moderated toward pro-social response tendencies when time is taken to reflect upon the implications and consequences. Second ostracism is proposed to impact four fundamental needs: belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence. Aggressive responding is more likely to occur when the needs pertaining to control and meaningful existence are especially threatened, whereas prosocial behavior is expected when ostracism threatens primarily needs related to belonging and self-esteem. Finally, ostracism of groups, or ostracism based upon group membership, is proposed to increase anti-social reaction tendencies more so than ostracism of individuals by other individuals. Other research on discontinuity has shown that group-group interactions are more likely to be characterized by competitiveness and distrust than person-person interactions. Thus, ostracism based upon group level characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, or religion, may be particularly prone to aggressive responses. <br/><br/>This research employs a number of innovative techniques, including a powerful yet simple computer based paradigm called ""Cyberball"" in which participants are ostracized from a virtual ball toss game. While appearing to be a rather minor and inconsequential form of ostracism, a recent study published in the magazine Science showed how only a few minutes of playing this game resulted in activation of brain's pain center. Another innovative method is the use of Virtual Reality technology to study the effects of feeling excluded, ignored, and being virtually invisible to other people. In addition, this work explores the effectiveness of the disciplinary procedure of ""time out"" by submitting the results of previously published work to a meta-analysis. This program broadens the participation of underrepresented groups and has the potential to benefit society in the areas of promoting positive educational environments and preventing harmful side effects that can result in school violence and, at a broader level, terrorism."

This new methodology is fundamentally different from the current practice whose performance is limited due to the non-dynamic and non-robust nature in the modeling approaches and in the data collection and processing strategies. This framework consists of two robust data pre-processing modules for highlighting fault features and removing sensor anomaly, three interrelated, multi-level models that describe different details of the system behaviors, and one dynamic strategy for the robust local interrogation that allows for measurements to be adaptively taken according to specific physical conditions and the associated risk level. It incorporates both historical data and on-line signals into the system modeling, and enables the ability to adaptively alter data collection procedures to best capture the critical system features. Collectively, these components lead to a robust and sensitive diagnosis system for wind turbines. This research is strengthened by a close collaboration with industry that will provide abundant historical sensor data and detailed system characterization, and also offer in-field implementation opportunities. <br/>The proposed research will have strategic importance on the utilization of wind energy that is currently the most viable clean energy alternative. Today, in the vast areas that have low wind speed, wind energy cannot compete with traditional energy sources as it has a higher cost, mainly owing to its high maintenance costs and low confidence in the diagnosis technology. This dynamic and data-driven fault diagnosis will play a key role in enabling a cost-effective generation of wind electricity. Progress in the fault diagnosis of blades and gearboxes will also benefit the power generation, automobile, aerospace, and engine industries. Meanwhile, the collaborative nature of this research will provide students with a multidisciplinary training and will bring industrial perspective to the universities. This project will have a long-term impact on education through the curriculum development and will promote the public awareness of clean energy concept through outreaches to high schools."

The resulting theory will help us to better understand how firms organize themselves and carry out their activities<br/><br/>Lawyers and economists have traditionally thought of a contract as providing parties with<br/>rights and obligations. These rights and obligations may be clearly spelled out (complete<br/>contracts) or not so clearly spelled out (incomplete contracts). However, in some cases<br/>it may be more useful to think of a contract as an indefinite agreement or agreement to agree. For example, suppose that a conference organizer approaches someone to be a keynote speaker in an event a year hence. The parties might agree on the speaker's fee now, but leave the topic of the speech to be determined later. This agreement is probably not legally binding, but may have value because, in effect, the parties have agreed not to negotiate later about the fee (which has already been set). In other words, the force of the agreement comes from what is ruled out (further bargaining about the fee) rather than from what is ruled in (the particular topic of the speech).<br/><br/>In work already developed, the PI has used this approach to explore the trade-off between<br/>ex ante incentives and ex post efficiency. This award funds work that will apply the same approach to understanding the internal organization of the firm. The approach seems well suited to this purpose since employment contracts traditionally have the form that an employee's wage is fixed in advance, while the employee's task is decided later.<br/><br/>This research will throw light on a number of important issues. It will help to explain why parties often deliberately write vague and incomplete contracts, and why contracts are short-term rather than long-term. It will throw new light on why much negotiation inside organizations occurs on dimensions other than wages (wages are fixed in advance, other things are not). The results will also provide a new perspective on the motives for corporate mergers. To the extent that the approach explains rigid (real) wages, it may elucidate the reasons for Keynesian-type unemployment."

A broad-scale ""family tree"" (phylogeny, genealogy) will be estimated using DNA sequences from approximately 250 species, representing all 126 families into which Lepidoptera are currently divided. A simultaneous review of known lepidopteran fossils will allow estimation of the geological ages of origin of the major groups. The 24 genes to be sequenced, identified by genome comparisons and screening in an earlier Tree of Life project, constitute far greater sampling of the genome than has heretofore been possible in most insects. Beyond providing a ""backbone"" phylogeny, the project is designed to catalyze a world-wide community effort to further resolve the lepidopteran tree, incorporating more traditional evidence from anatomy and behavior in addition to DNA. Annual lab workshops will help other lepidopterists to apply the numerous genes developed for this project, methods for which will be continuously updated on the web. An international network of >20 experts on Lepidoptera will help to choose species and provide specimens for project DNA sequencing. These experts will also jointly produce the first comprehensive catalog of anatomical features potentially informative about lepidopteran family genealogy, clarifying the chaotic terminology which has frustrated previous attempts to employ these traits for tree-building. A central project feature, also borrowed from modern genomics, will be an interactive website allowing the project team plus any other researcher to contribute and download data, methods, analysis and commentary on lepidopteran phylogeny at any level. The intent is to foster global cooperation and progress toward a fully-resolved tree. The web site will be ""seeded"" with most of the current evidence, to ensure a critical mass of information for others to build on. The same compilations will be used to greatly augment the available resources for public education on Lepidoptera, through contributions to popular web sites such as the Tree of Life.<br/><br/>The Lepidoptera are the largest single group of plant-feeding insects, numbering over 160,000 species. Ubiquitous and familiar, they are both a vital component of terrestrial ecosystems - what would birds and bats eat without them?- and arguably the most damaging group of pests overall to agriculture. As unusually conspicuous terrestrial non-vertebrates, Lepidoptera are extensively used in ecosystem assessment, and for educating and involving the public in environmental biology. They are also important focal organisms in many areas of biological research. For example, the evolutionary diversification of Lepidoptera in association with the rise of flowering plants, beginning in the Age of Dinosaurs, has figured prominently in the attempt to understand the origins of today's biodiversity. A well- corroborated ""family tree"" is essential both for understanding any aspect of lepidopteran evolution, and for constructing classifications that let us effectively organize and apply our voluminous knowledge about individual moth and butterfly species. However, relatively little progress toward such a tree has heretofore been made."

The existing observational array will be augmented with an assortment of sensors designed to measure fluid forces and physical and geochemical responses near, at, and below the seabed. Some sensors represent existing technology, some represent relatively new technology in development, and others will be developed, tested, and deployed as part of this project (subseabed thermistor and redox sensor arrays, benthic chlorophyll fluorescence imaging). Present instrumentation includes meteorological packages, ADCPs, surface and bottom CTDs, fluorometers and PAR sensors. The observatory instrumentation will be used to characterize the seabed response to physical forces acting across a spectrum of time scales. The frequency, intensity, and timing of energetic events will be detected within the water column, and their manifestation within the BBL will be followed. BBL instrumentation will measure thresholds of bed motion and characterize near-bed suspended loads, and will be used to estimate pressure fields and advective fluxes at the interface. In situ geochemical sensors will be used to characterize rates of advection of properties within the sediment and connect those properties to both physical forcing above the interface and biological forcing driven by seasonal and diurnal cues. The combination of instrumentation and observational strategies will produce a holistic portrait of the causes and consequences of benthic exchange processes in permeable sediments."

Rotation affects the character and complexity of fluid parcel trajectories, with important consequences for mixing and residence times. A combination of observations and analytical and numerical simulations will be conducted to verify and extend this model. Field observations will be done during the winter season 2004-2005 in Bahia Concepcion, on the Gulf of California side of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico. The bay is subject to strong wind forcing throughout the winter, when it is vertically well mixed. The observations will include moored instrumentation, shipboard surveys and drifter deployments and the scientific objectives are:<br/>(a) to describe through observations how rotation affects the wind-driven circulation and the exchange with the ocean in a relatively deep, well-mixed, semi-enclosed bay that is exposed to strong winds, and<br/>(b) to extend the analytical model to represent the circulation driven by tides and by lateral density gradients, and to describe with numerical models how advection and vertical stratification modify this circulation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The ecological and societal importance of small coastal basins (bays, estuaries, lagoons) is out of proportion with their size. Among other ecological functions, lagoons and estuaries serve as way stations for bird migration, as nurseries for fauna and flora and as mating and calving grounds for certain marine mammals. At the same time these water bodies have been deeply impacted by anthropogenic activities. By developing a dynamical description of the processes that control circulation in these basins and exchange with the ocean, this study will help minimize human impacts such as sewage discharge through science-based management and engineering practices. In addition, this project represents international collaboration with Mexican scientists, supports two graduate students. One of the PIs is a member of an underrepresented group.

Among the most important changes and those best reflected in the fossil record involved the shape of the head, related to language, diet, defense, threat, olfaction, intelligence, vision, and posture. These include shortening the face and tucking it under the braincase, smaller teeth (especially canines), increased brain size, and reorientation of the cranial base. Our knowledge of the evolution of these traits will remain limited until we understand their underlying biological, and in particular, genetic bases. <br/>The purpose of this pilot project is to identify genetic factors underlying the nature and timing of changes in skull shape during the evolution of humans, apes, and Old World monkeys. A combined strategy will: (1) identify the dimensions of natural craniofacial development, variation and evolution from living and fossil primate skulls, (2) identify genes that in baboons and mice are associated with variation in those dimensions, and (3) experimentally confirm that these genes are appropriately expressed during craniofacial developmental networks that may be responsible for evolution of craniofacial shape within and between species. <br/>3D reconstructions of a set of computed X-ray tomography (CT) scans acquired from a set of fossil African papionin skulls will be analyzed quantitatively to identify single and multivariate axes of craniofacial variation. These results will be coupled with observations from the literature to identify features of craniofacial variation that were important in the evolution of these animals. Similar CT scans will be obtained from approximately 250 baboon skulls in a large, known genealogy at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research (SFBR), that have been genotyped for about 350 microsatellite markers across the genome. Linkage mapping will be done to identify chromosomal regions in the baboons that affect these axes of variation. Mice and primates share the basic processes of skeletal development, so the mouse is a phenotypic and genetic model for identifying these processes, and two gene mapping approaches will be taken to do that. Chromosomal regions identified by mapping in the mouse and baboon will be tested experimentally by examining gene expression and DNA sequence changes in coding or regulatory regions that affect the axes of craniofacial change that were identified from the CT scans. <br/> This is an integrated developmental evolutionary approach to understand the genetic elements of craniofacial variation. Current phylogenetic approaches use craniofacial features in the absence of knowledge of their genetic basis. One consequence is that we cannot discriminate between change due to common genetic determination and adaptive convergence and this has led to inconsistencies between molecular and morphologically based phylogenies. The identification of developmental genetic pathways will provide tests of the homology of such traits. <br/> Intellectual Merit -- The general problems and approaches to the developmental genetics of complex metric traits are of widespread interest to biologists of all types because similar problems and processes are widespread in nature.<br/> Broader Impact -- The researchers will create a major archive of 3D CT images of baboon skulls, genetic materials, and quantitative methods, and make them available to other investigators. This project involves several institutions here and abroad, and will include undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students. Post docs working in the various laboratories will travel to the Southwest Foundation to train in methods of analysis. Women and minority students are regularly trained in these labs and minority students will be actively recruited."

Without flowering there would be no seed formation for the propagation of subsequent generations. In food plants, timely and adequate seed yields are essential for human and animal nutrition. The process of flowering, which is so vital to humankind, has been extensively studied in herbaceous annual plants that germinate, grow, flower, produce seed and die within one year. Many of the genes that regulate the flowering process have been identified and studied in the small annual plant, Arabidopsis, which serves as a model for crops. However, little is known about the mechanisms regulating flowering in woody perennial plants such as trees. <br/><br/>This project will study the flowering process in trees in the genus Populus, which contains cottonwoods, aspens and poplars. Unlike annual plants, trees undergo cycles of vegetative and floral growth each year that are affected by dramatic seasonal changes in temperature and light. The goals is to discover the important differences and similarities among the factors that regulate flowering in annual and perennial plants. A research project has been developed to determine if the molecular basis of floral bud induction/initiation in response to environmental and physiological factors differs between Arabidopsis and Populus. Project activities will include physiological and genetic manipulations of plants, evolutionary comparisons of gene sequences and examination of the expression patterns to accomplish these objectives. Populus has become the experimental model for tree research because the entire genome has been sequenced and the plant can be genetically transformed. Populus species are economically and ecologically important and the outcomes of this project will have many practical applications. These include manipulation of seed/fruit production, acceleration of breeding programs, increased production of woody biomass, and biological confinement of transgenes, among others. <br/><br/>Outreach components of the project range from biotechnology workshops for teachers to recruitment of high school and college minority students for individual research projects in participating laboratories.<br/><br/>Project outcomes will be available through the Populus Floral Genome Web Site (accessible through http://www.floralgenome.org/) and the Populus Genome Portal (http://bahama.jgi-psf.org/prod/bin/populus/home.populus.cgi)."

Yet, no widely-accepted mathematical theory currently exists to quantitatively characterize surprise elicited by a stimulus or event, for observers that range from single neurons to complex natural or engineered systems. This project develops a formal Bayesian definition of surprise that is the only consistent formulation under minimal axiomatic assumptions. Surprise quantifies how data affects natural or artificial observers, by measuring the difference between posterior and prior beliefs of the observers. Preliminary human eye-tracking experiments demonstrated that participants gaze towards surprising image regions, significantly more than expected by chance, while watching complex videoclips including TV and video games. What are the underlying<br/>neural mechanisms responsible for this behavior? This cross-disciplinary proposal addresses this question as follows:<br/><br/>- Theory and modeling, to investigate how surprise relates to previous notions of saliency and novelty, and may advantageously complement Shannon information when analyzing neural function and behavior.<br/><br/>- Monkey electrophysiology with simple surprising stimuli, to investigate how single-neurons along the sensorimotor processing stream (primary visual cortex, frontal eye fields, superior colliculus) may be modulated by surprise.<br/><br/>- Parallel human/monkey psychophysics/electrophysiology, to investigate, in natural situations and with more complex stimuli including TV programs, whether stimuli which attract human and monkey attention may carry more Bayesian surprise.<br/><br/>The theory of surprise developed here is applicable across different modalities, datatypes, tasks, and abstraction levels. It has potential for impacting science and engineering, and especially education in computer science, mathematics, information theory, statistics, psychology and biology. The research involves undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral trainees in a collaboration between a theory lab (Baldi), a modeling and psychophysics lab (Itti), and a monkey electrophysiology lab (Munoz)."

The Institutes will build networks of relationships and publishing activities that will expand and enrich international outreach. Approximately 72 ""new entrants"" to the field over three continents will participate in intensive four-day Institutes, led by distinguished faculty from both the US and international institutions. The three Institutes will be unified by the intellectual theme of the intersection of rights and regulation. In the context of the tricontinental nature of the 2005-2007 Institutes, this theme will advance knowledge and understanding within sociolegal studies by developing its transnational and comparative dimensions as well as by systematically linking sub-fields (specifically those of regulation and rights) in ways that may also provide a model to others for future research. Three sets of concrete activities will link the sequence of Institutes to broaden their impact: a website that will showcase the work of emerging scholars in a high quality web-based publication; synergistic links with existing Collaborative Research Networks already established by LSA; and editorial collaboration across the three Institutes that will coordinate traditional publication objectives (special issues in leading sociolegal journals). The combined impact of the Institutes and the activities that link them will be three-fold. First, U.S. students and junior faculty will gain exposure to international sociolegal scholarship in a context that initiates personal relationships and fosters future collaboration with foreign counterparts. Secondly, the Institutes will broaden the participation of under-represented groups and foster diversity in the field, especially racial and geographic diversity. Thirdly, the Institutes will enhance the infrastructure (and demonstrate the potential) for interdisciplinary research and education through a transnational network that feeds into publication, particularly of the work of junior scholars in the field.

A broad-scale ""family tree"" (phylogeny, genealogy) will be estimated using DNA sequences from approximately 250 species, representing all 126 families into which Lepidoptera are currently divided. A simultaneous review of known lepidopteran fossils will allow estimation of the geological ages of origin of the major groups. The 24 genes to be sequenced,  identified by genome comparisons and screening in an earlier Tree of Life project, constitute far greater sampling of the genome than has heretofore been possible in most insects.  Beyond providing a ""backbone"" phylogeny, the project is designed to catalyze a world-wide community effort to further resolve the lepidopteran tree, incorporating more traditional evidence from anatomy and behavior in addition to DNA. Annual lab workshops will help other lepidopterists to apply the numerous genes developed for this project, methods for which will be continuously updated on the web. An international network of >20 experts on Lepidoptera will help to choose species and provide specimens for project DNA sequencing.  These experts will also jointly produce the first comprehensive catalog of anatomical features potentially informative about lepidopteran family genealogy, clarifying the chaotic  terminology which has frustrated previous attempts to employ these traits for tree-building. A central project feature, also borrowed from modern genomics, will be an interactive website allowing the project team plus any other researcher to contribute and download data, methods, analysis and commentary on lepidopteran phylogeny at any level. The intent is to  foster global cooperation and progress toward a fully-resolved tree. The web site will be  ""seeded""  with most of the current evidence, to ensure a critical mass of information for others to build on. The same compilations will be used to greatly augment the available resources for public education on Lepidoptera, through contributions to popular web sites such as the  Tree of Life.<br/>                                                                        <br/>The Lepidoptera are the largest single group of plant-feeding insects, numbering over 160,000 species. Ubiquitous and familiar, they are both a vital component of terrestrial ecosystems - what would birds and bats eat without them?- and  arguably the most damaging group of pests overall to agriculture.  As unusually conspicuous terrestrial non-vertebrates, Lepidoptera are  extensively used in ecosystem assessment, and for educating and involving the public in environmental biology.  They are also important focal organisms in many areas of biological research. For example, the evolutionary diversification of Lepidoptera in association with the rise of flowering plants, beginning in the Age of Dinosaurs, has figured prominently in the attempt to understand the origins of today's biodiversity. A well- corroborated ""family tree"" is essential both for understanding any aspect of lepidopteran evolution, and for constructing classifications that let us effectively organize and apply our voluminous knowledge about individual moth and butterfly species.  However, relatively little progress toward such a tree has heretofore been made."

As new public policies are considered to address these issues, science is currently unable to predict unintended consequences of proposed public policies on materials flows and life cycle environmental emissions. Consequently, the overarching goal of this MUSES program is to establish quantitative relationships between materials flows and policy options. With this planning grant award, we will form a team of expert investigators that will develop an integrated proposal for research that will accomplish the following: 1) establish a rigorous scientific methodology for predicting engineering design responses to a set of policy options based on an understanding of corporate incentives, technology design, and production costs; 2) evaluate market penetration these responses through model-based understanding of consumer preferences; and, 3) quantitatively model the impact of these responses on life-cycle materials flows and environmental emissions. The outcomes will inform the automotive policy development process through objective and quantitative modeling approaches. <br/><br/>The scientific impact of the research will include a clearer understanding of relationships between technology options, policy decisions and life cycle materials flows and emissions. The broader impact will include the development of decision modeling tools through an integrated, systems-based modeling package that will allow decision makers to evaluate and optimize technology and policy decisions with respect to costs, market acceptance, and environmental impacts."

This project will develop statistical methods for separating a given population into its distinct component distributions, including estimation of the number of components and nonparametric estimation of the component distributions. These different components reflect the latent individual differences in the population. A principal way in which this research differs from other research on mixture models is that the focus is on weakening the often strong and possibly unrealistic parametric assumptions that have, in the past, possibly limited the wider application of mixture theory. Specifically, this research will compare existing Bayesian methods to determine the number of components in a nonparametric mixture and develop new Bayesian methods. When covariate information is available, the project will study mixtures of regressions, in which a goal is the estimation of the mixing proportions as a function of the covariate(s). Finally, the project will use analytical and computer simulation methods to expand previously funded research in nonparametric mixture models to the one-way layout and multiple comparisons, an area in which traditional methods such as analysis of variance and standard nonparametric alternatives can fail to detect certain kinds of group differences. <br/><br/>The mixture models developed in this project make it possible to both conceptualize and identify individual latent differences such as differences in thinking styles. These mixtures provide not only a useful conceptual perspective but a practical one as well, in that it is possible to identify, at the level of the individual, which cognitive strategy (for example) a person most likely used in the solution of a problem. Having a framework for conceptualizing and identifying how growing children are different in those latent (unobserved) processes vital for effective learning and school achievement would have important implications for how learning environments are constructed. Yet the techniques developed, largely motivated by psychological concerns, are applicable to any field of scientific empirical inquiry employing statistical data analysis in which latent variables have a measurable impact. Thus, this research has broad implications for a variety of intellectual activities."

Firstly, both profile-based probabilistic approaches and word-based enumerative approaches will be used to attempt to identify short, imperfectly conserved, sub-sequences that are correlated with alternative splicing. The MAASE resource allows generating datasets that comprise many distinct classes of alternative splicing so class specific effects can be identified. It is likely that these signals, if present, are weak and act in groups (as in eukaryotic promoters). Methods that allow multiple motifs to be combined will be used, and new methods developed. Because secondary and tertiary structure are known to be important for RNA function, and because conserved sequence motifs are weak and difficult to find, it appears highly likely that structural motifs could be involved in control of RNA splicing. Methods to identify conserved secondary or tertiary structures are not well developed. The PIs will use existing methods and develop novel methods that are capable of identifying the greatest common structure in a training set of sequences. Such shared structures are strong candidates for structural regulatory elements. The datasets produced and used in this study will be made publicly available for other research groups.

In this project, the PI conducts research to understand and<br/>provide solutions on balancing the tradeoffs between privacy and security<br/>in P2P systems. Specifically, (1) the PI develops anonymity communication<br/>protocols to provide privacy protection for P2P users with security<br/>insurance; (2) taking overlay distributed denial-of-service and file<br/>integrity as case studies for security issues, the PI develops technical<br/>security solutions without conflict with privacy requirements; (3) the<br/>research investigates a wide range of security issues by developing<br/>security solutions to balance tradeoffs of privacy and security. This<br/>project is integrated to a Microsoft sponsored undergraduate course<br/>development, where important topics of networking security and privacy,<br/>design of decentralized P2P systems are being studied.<br/>----------------------------------------------------------"

While fault-tolerant computing is a mature area of research, automatically designing reliable systems out of unreliable components has proven to be a challenging task. Since a practical solution to synthesizing in an automated manner, nano-scale designs that are inherently fault-tolerant has yet to be found, theoretical bounds may offer a good insight into the achievable limits of error-resilience and required minimum redundancy (or extra logic) needed. This research is intended to fill this gap and is poised to have broader impact on possible novel modeling, design and system architecture concepts involved in silicon nano-electronics and beyond (SNB). One can envision applicability of the proposed modeling techniques to atomic scale DNA-based switches. The combination of the properties of nucleic acid with those of the metal ions can lead to chemically or physically activated switches that can be combined to achieve certain functionalities or to perform relatively complex Boolean functions. Since such switches are not perfect and redundancy use is mandatory for achieving reliable global switching behavior, determining a priori theoretical bounds for the necessary redundancy is of chief practical interest. Potential applications of these structures are in molecular electronics that might be used in human body-implanted sensors and actuators or non-invasive drug delivery systems."

Little is known about the interactions between patterns and processes in human dominated landscapes, however. One of the least understood aspects of urban landscape dynamics is the way in which local interactions of humans and biophysical processes generate the landscape patterns of metropolitan regions. Studying the relationships between these interactions and the resulting urban landscape patterns is critical to plan and manage urban growth in ways that minimize the ecological impacts on ecosystems while sustaining economically and socially viable urban communities. This research project will examine urban landscapes as emergent phenomena that result from local interactions of human agents, real estate markets, built infrastructure, and biophysical factors like land cover, geomorphology, and natural disturbance regimes to develop a theory of urban landscape dynamics. The study will employ complex systems, patch dynamics, hierarchical theory, and an agent-based modeling approach to study coupled human-natural dynamics and empirically test this approach in two different bioregions (Seattle and Phoenix). The models will be developed and used to test hypotheses regarding emergent properties of urban landscapes and to enhance basic understanding of humans-ecological interactions in urban landscapes across scales. Urban landscapes exhibit some fundamental features of complex self-organizing systems. They are highly heterogeneous, spatially nested, and hierarchically structured. The urban spatial structure can be described as a cumulative and aggregate pattern that results from numerous local decisions involving a large number of adaptive agents interacting among themselves and with biophysical factors. These behaviors eventually can lead to different metropolitan patterns. This research will address four questions: (1) How do dynamic landscape systems evolve to generate emergent patterns that are evident in urban landscapes? (2) What nonlinearities, thresholds, discontinuities, and path dependencies explain divergent trajectories of urban landscapes? (3) How do emergent urban landscape patterns influence biodiversity and ecosystem functioning? (4) How can planning integrate this knowledge to develop sustainable urban landscape patterns? The model implementation will be based on a dynamic probabilistic relational model (DPRM) in which parameters and spatial rules are estimated empirically from two longitudinal land-cover and land-use data sets developed for the Seattle and Phoenix metropolitan areas.<br/><br/>The project will have significant theoretical and practical impacts. It will develop a better understanding of complex human-ecological dynamics leading to development patterns such as sprawl, one of the most pressing and controversial problem in the United States. The project will also contribute to advancing biocomplexity science. The findings of this research will have an impact on both the social and natural sciences particularly the study of development patterns, land-use change, ecological resilience, and public policy in urbanizing regions. This project will also employ new computational techniques that are of importance to a broad range of disciplines studying human dynamics, ecology, and artificial intelligence. The findings will also aid planning and management of urban regions by providing simulation tools to assess the ecological impacts and feedback of alternative strategies for urban development and ecological conservation. This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems."

Accurately predicting these by resolving the finest scales in a computer simulation is prohibitively expensive. The investigators are studying how fine scale information impacts coarse scale behavior and vice versa. In effect, ""summarizing"" these relationships allow us to model coarse scale effects accurately and efficiently without the need to explicitly resolve the finest scales in a computation. A key to this study lies in the careful transfer of structures present in the mathematical models of these phenomena (which in essence have infinite resolution) to the computational realm with its finite resolution and finite computational resources. The methods being developed will allow rapid assessment of overall effects with the ability ""to drill down"" computationally where additional detail is required.<br/><br/>Physical systems are typically described by a set of continuous equations using tools from geometric mechanics and differential geometry to analyze and capture their properties. For purposes of computation one must derive discrete (in space and time) representations of the underlying equations. Theories which are discrete from the start (rather than discretized after the fact), with key geometric properties built in, can more readily yield robust numerical simulations which are true to the underlying continuous systems: they exactly preserve invariants of the continuous systems in the discrete computational realm. So far these methods have not accounted for effects across scales. Yet both physics and numerical computation require such multi-resolution strategies. This research project is developing a multi-resolution theory for discrete variational methods and discrete differential geometry with applications to thin-shell and fluid modeling. The principal scientific innovation lies in techniques to conserve symmetries across computational scales."

These studies are designed to test the effectiveness of a concept formation and explanation-based approach to learning and instruction. They also test the effectiveness of visual graphics and corrective feedback in learning difficult physical concepts that have multiple processes occurring simultaneously. <br/> We know that explanation-based instruction increases understanding, learning, and retention of information. The structuring of text material in clear, explicit, causal, and explanatory ways is highly effective in achieving understanding and retention immediately and over the long term. The use of visual graphics in teaching about invisible physical processes, however, may be a critical variable for ensuring accurate understanding, above and beyond the coherence of a text. Receiving corrective feedback that compares the correct answer to an incorrect or incomplete answer may also be critical. <br/> The review of curricular materials used in elementary school science classes on this topic noted the clear absence of explicit concept definitions as well as explicit causal links that explained the relationships among many core concepts. Further, the explicit acknowledgement of ongoing parallel processes was never mentioned. In contrast, our curriculum for the current studies provides explicit definitions of all the concepts, explanations of all the processes, and a focus on the unfolding of parallel processes. <br/> The curriculum was designed using an ideal end-state model of what it would mean for a student to have a correct and complete understanding of the water cycle. This model is used as a basis for assessments as well as instruction. The model is also used to suggest when and how graphics may be incorporated most effectively into instruction, as visual explanations of important, but invisible processes. <br/> The study will include students and teachers in Chicago public schools. In the first two years of studies, 3rd and 4th grade teachers, 3rd and 4th grade students, and students from 7th and 12th grades will be pulled out for special instruction on these science units. Instruction will vary in terms of the amount and kind of feedback given to students to address misconceptions, whether students self-explain the materials out loud or not, and the presence or absence of static or animated visual graphics. In the third year, 3rd and 4th grade teachers who have first served as learners in our studies will then implement and teach the units in their own classrooms. <br/> The effectiveness of the new curriculum will be tested in two ways. In all three years, learning will be assessed via pre-post interviews and tests with students and teachers who receive different versions of the unit. We will also compare our students' performance to the performance of students who have not received our curriculum, but who have used other curricular materials like the FOSS system. Students will be compared on their knowledge of the water cycle and on their knowledge of general science concepts"

A class of sequential data assimilation techniques known as ensemble methods provides a promising way to deal with the issues of nonlinearity, high dimensionality, and uncertainty, which are all important in environmental applications. Ensemble methods effectively construct low dimensional approximations of complex nonlinear systems from a relatively small number of random replicates (model simulations driven by random initial conditions and model inputs). The approximations used by ensemble data assimilation methods can be viewed as projections of the original state space on continually changing random subspaces. These subspaces have structure that reflects the influence of physical constraints. But there is also a strong element of chance in the approximation process. This randomness seems to provide robustness and flexibility that cannot be so readily achieved with deterministic approximation methods, especially for large nonlinear problems. Although ensemble data assimilation is being applied to environmental problems with increasing frequency there is no body of theory that explains when or why it works. In particular, researchers do not understand why projections onto random linear subspaces can yield improved approximations for highly nonlinear problems. This project will advance understanding of ensemble estimation and provide a sound theoretical basis for the application and improvement of ensemble methods. It will combine theoretical analysis and computational experiments in a staged approach that gradually moves from simple to more complex problems. The project will rely on recent mathematical advances in random matrix theory and on the availability of parallel computing resources that are especially well-suited to ensemble applications.<br/><br/>The earth sciences are in the midst of an important transformation, due in large part to a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of available information. Remote sensing has already had a significant impact on meteorology, hydrology and oceanography. Assimilation of all this new information is a challenging task. Nevertheless, the potential benefits are substantial, particularly at a time when climate change, population pressures on natural resources, and major modifications in global element cycles are attracting increasing attention. This project will investigate very efficient but poorly understood methods for assimilating and merging large amounts of diverse satellite data. The mathematical issues to be investigated are relevant to applications ranging from cell phone networks to oceanography. This project will support two major education/outreach activities: 1) involvement of undergraduate researchers in development of mathematical teaching laboratories and in earth science research projects, 2) a public outreach partnership with the Current Science & Technology Center (CS&T) at the Boston Museum of Science (including exhibits, multimedia presentations, and hands-on workshops).

Aging effects in sand, such as increases in penetration resistance with time after deposition, densification, and/or liquefaction, are known to occur in-situ, but the causes of these effects are not fully understood. Nonetheless, these effects have important ramifications in earthquake engineering. First, the lack of understanding of the phenomenon is an impediment to quality assurance (QA) for ground densification projects aimed at mitigating the damaging effects of liquefaction. Also, aging effects introduce considerable uncertainty in field-based liquefaction susceptibility correlations, as the influence of aging on the in-situ test indices used to develop correlations is unknown but certainly varied among the case histories in the liquefaction database. Within the realm of probabilistic based earthquake engineering (PBEE), a probabilistic quantification of the influence of aging on in-situ indices is required. <br/>Previous investigations into the underlying mechanisms of aging of sands have been inconclusive, sometimes raising more questions than resolving. Unfortunately, the boundary conditions for most published field studies have been too numerous and variable to conclusively identify the mechanisms underlying aging. Nevertheless, the results of such field studies add to the evidence that the aging phenomenon exists. Building on the lessons learned from previous studies, this research entails synergistic field and laboratory investigations to be performed collaboratively by the University of Michigan and by the University of Rhode Island. Also included on the research team is Dr. Wilhelm Degen, Senior Vice President, Vibrofoundation, Inc., who will be donating equipment time and expertise and Dr. James K. Mitchell (Virginia Tech), one of the foremost experts on the aging phenomenon. The field investigation will involve inducing liquefaction by explosives, vibroflotation, and vibroseis at adjacent locations. The former two techniques were selected because they are ground densification methods in which the aging phenomenon has been observed. However, both methods introduce foreign elements into the soil: explosives - blast gases; vibroflotation - heavily aerated water. On the contrary, the vibroseis (NEES equipment), only introduces seismic waves into the ground, and thus, will allow discernment of the contribution of blast gases and heavily aerated water on the aging phenomenon. In conjunction with the field investigation, an aging study will be performed in the laboratory using soil and groundwater from the field site, with the purpose of discerning the scale and different stress state effects on aging. <br/>There are several broader impacts stemming from the proposed research. For society at large, this research will help minimize losses from earthquakes by improving the current methods for liquefaction risk assessment and mitigation. Technology transfer will be ensured, as the corporate partner will have input on the testing plan, as well as direct access to the research findings, with other interested parties having access to the data/findings via the NEESgrid. The educational impacts will not only result from the increased technical understanding of the subject matter, but will also result from the collaborative nature of the proposed research and the educational outreach program with Bates Elementary School, Dexter, Michigan. Regarding the outreach to women and underrepresented minorities, the PI participates in several University of Michigan programs tailored for such purposes: Grace Hopper Project, Marian Sarah Parker Scholars Program, Summer Research Opportunity Program, and the Summer Engineering Exploration Camp. Through these programs, several undergraduate women and/or underrepresented minorities will be involved in the proposed research, with the exact nature and level of the involvement depending on student availability and research schedule."

Principal Investigator Dr. John Arthur and Co-Principal Investigator Dr. Kathryn Weedman will use the vehicle to conduct archaeological, ethnoarchaeological, and oral history research in the remote highlands of southwestern Ethiopia. Arthur and Weedman's research among the Gamo of southwestern Ethiopia will reveal an interpretation of Gamo culture history and the development of their caste system, both of which have never been investigated. <br/><br/>Caste systems are prevalent throughout Asia and Africa, including Ethiopia, where they have a profound affect on the marriage relations, status, occupation, settlement patterns, ritual purity, diet, and burial placement. However, there has been little archaeological research, especially in Ethiopia or Africa, which addresses the identification, origin, and development of caste societies. By combining oral history, archaeology, and ethnoarchaeology, it is hoped that this project will disclose new hypotheses and interpretations through indigenous worldviews concerning the origin and development of a non-western state system, caste. In addition, their research also will contribute to a better understanding of broader issues in anthropology and archaeology including craft specialization, identity and the formation of complex societies.<br/><br/>The vehicle will enable Arthur and Weedman to transport American, French, and Ethiopian researchers, students, and assistants in Ethiopia. It will primarily be used in the Gamo region, which is a very remote highland area of Ethiopia that requires a 4-wheel drive vehicle to safely maneuver the dirt-track roads. There is virtually no public transportation in the Gamo region and certainly none that could directly carry researchers and their equipment to the villages and archaeological sites where they will be working. Arthur and Weedman intend to collaborate with five European and Ethiopian researchers, as well as train at least six American and Ethiopian students. The purchase of the vehicle will allow the transport of more personnel while saving precious field-time and reducing long-term costs. This award will provide Arthur and Weedman with a significant long-term cost-effective means for transportation in the highlands of southwestern Ethiopia enabling them to train more students and collaborate with other researchers."

Methods of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and probabilistic statistics will be applied to obtain a hierarchy of stochastic Lagrangian models of varying complexity. Models will be verified using a first-exit time concept and probability weighted moment techniques. The approach will utilize shorter observation series than traditional methods used in oceanography, be robust to the effects of noise in the measurements, and account for inhomogeneity of wave-eddy oceanic fields. The effectiveness of the mathematical technique will be illustrated by estimating Lagrangian statistics and ocean currents using subsurface float observations from the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans.<br/><br/>Robust mathematical techniques will be developed for the analysis of the motion of floats and drifters in the ocean. The higher accuracy of these new techniques will improve the description of mean velocity fields as well as those for the path and dispersal of ocean waters. Computational efficiencies may allow more efficient assimilation of Lagrangian data into numerical ocean models. Results will allow a better understanding and description of the exchange of ocean waters between various geographic regions such as the continental margin and the deep ocean or between Subtropical and Subarctic ocean gyres. Results will contribute to related problems such as estimating the carbon export from the continental margin to the deep sea, the sequestration of carbon dioxide in Subtropical regions, and the dispersal of pollutants in the ocean. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposal will involve graduate students and young scientists including women from the Naval Postgraduate School (Monterey, CA), University of Southern California (Los Angeles, CA) as well as other Monterey area institutions (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, and Pacific Fisheries Environmental Laboratory). Current velocity and diffusivity will be used to forecast biological productivity along the Central California Coast. In collaboration with researchers from the Southampton (U.K.) Oceanographic Center, the methods developed will be applied to ARGO float observations collected in the North Atlantic in order to reconstruct and understand variability of mid depth ocean circulation. This will contribute the ARGO program, the Global Ocean and Climate Observing Systems. Activities will include open scientific communications as well as presentations to the broader community. To assure the dissemination of the research to the broadest possible scientific and public audience, project results will be published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature in a timely manner; and presented at scientific conferences and workshops in the United States and abroad.

Previous studies by the PIs found this phenomenon of high capacity, which cannot be explained by conventional equilibrium models involving sorption onto ferric hydroxide or iron-arsenic precipitates. The study will test the hypothesis that removal of As(V) at a greater than 1:1 molar ratio of As:Fe is due to reduction and subsequent precipitation of arsenic sulfides within the pores of GAC. The PIs also will investigate the importance of various basic water quality/chemistry characteristics, such as pH, alkalinity, and concentrations of natural organic matter and dissolved oxygen, on rates and extent of As removal. The speciation of As after its removal by tailored GAC will be determined using extended x-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) and Mossbauer spectroscopy."

The requested funds would be highly leveraged because most of the cost of drilling a 5km deep borehole will be borne by industry and the Icelandic government, with participation from the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program. An Icelandic geothermal power company is providing an existing ~ 3 km deep well for deepening to 5 km depth. This project will provide the first opportunity worldwide to investigate the deep, high temperature reaction zone of a mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal system, which has been a long-standing goal of the Ocean Drilling Program. This drill site is ideally situated for a broad array of scientific studies involving reactions between basalt and seawater at high temperatures, reaching supercritical conditions. Such active processes in the deep, high temperature reaction zones that control fluid compositions of black smokers have never before been available for comprehensive direct study and sampling. Ocean drilling has penetrated only 2 km into 5 Ma old ocean crust. where temperatures were ~ 180 oC. In contrast, the IDDP collaboration with industry in Iceland will produce fluid samples from the flow tests at 3, 4, and 5 km, drill cuttings and spot cores down to 4.0 km depth, and 1.0 km of continuous drill core from 4.0 to 5.0 km depth. These samples will reveal the integrated record of basalt-seawater interactions at >400oC.

The SLiDAP remote imaging network uses digital still pictures transmitted through a satellite data link, to reconstruct virtual 3D models of individual animals and their colonies. The development of the SLiDAP system was initiated to address significant gaps in the knowledge about many declining species of seals and sea lions in remote, polar regions. Specifically, information on year round trends in body condition and health of the Steller sea lion is vital to test the suggestion that a reduction in food abundance or quality, possibly related to extensive commercial fishing, may be contributing to the decline of this endangered species. Under this new funding, infrared cameras will be integrated into the SLiDAP system. Infrared cameras will allow users to remotely collect accurate temperature measurements on individual sea lions. The infrared images will be used to extend animal census operations into low light conditions, and to diagnose the health status of individual sea lions. The integration of infrared imaging into the existing SLiDAP system will be a substantial enhancement of the efforts to test the possible effects intense fishing on a declining marine mammal species. <br/>To integrate infrared cameras into the SLiDAP system, several software and hardware elements of the system will be extensively modified. The software that controls the imaging system and allows for remote operations will be adapted to accommodate the new camera type. The glass viewport that allows pictures to be collected by cameras protected from a fairly extreme environment, will be modified to permit accurate temperature measurements, since the current design is not transparent to heat radiation essential to infrared imaging. The current ice removal system was developed by undergraduate students with Texas A&M University's Marine Engineering Technology department, and the revision of the system will also be carried out by undergraduate engineering students. Simultaneously, Dr. Jo-Ann Mellish and her student will calibrate the relationship between infrared signatures of individual sea lions held at the Alaska Sea Life Center, and the extent of body fat stored by the sea lions under their skin. This calibration will permit an accurate estimation of changes in the sea lions' body condition throughout the year. <br/><br/>The SLIDAP remote data collection network will open many inaccessible regions for long-term scientific observations that currently cannot be performed by other means, in addition to facilitating the collection of vital data on the biology of many animals species in a rapidly changing Alaskan ecosystem. The integration of remote temperature measurements will be a significant enhancement of the ability of the SLiDAP network to collect accurate measurements from animals and their environment. The development of a web-based multi-user shared access control interface for the SLiDAP network is being planned. Through this interface, the SLiDAP resource can be shared by many different institutions in different locations."

This research effort aims to design and build a laboratory-scale DDDAS, called Planet-in-a-Bottle, as a practical and inexpensive step toward a planet-scale DDDAS. The Planet-in-a-Bottle DDDAS will emulate many of the large-scale challenges of meteorological and oceanographic state-estimation and forecasting but provide a controlled setting to allow systematic engineering strategies to be employed to devise more efficient and accurate techniques. The Planet-in-a-Bottle DDDAS will consist of two interacting parts: a fluid lab experiment and a numerical simulator. The system will employ data assimilation in which actual observations are fed into the simulator to keep the models on track with reality, and will employ sensitivity-driven observations and mesh refinement in which the simulator targets the real-time deployment of sensors to particular geographical regions and times for maximal effect, and refines the mesh to better predict the future course of the fluid experiment. In addition, the feedback loop between targeting of both the observational system and mesh refinement will be mediated, if desired, by human control.<br/><br/>The project will investigate adjoint methods to determine how and where to deploy observations, as well as how and where to refine the simulation. The laboratory will provide insights into nonlinear fluid dynamics by visualizing and analyzing the three-dimensional behavior of a natural fluid noninvasively. Fundamental questions regarding the predictability of chaotic systems and the impact of adapting models and observations dynamically on the predictive capabilities will be explored. To design an effective Planet-in-a-Bottle DDDAS requires a substantial investment in advanced computing technology, because a naive simulation on regular meshes take far longer than the real-time evolution of the fluid. To enhance performance, the research project will devise novel algorithms and software that exploit low-cost clusters of commodity processors. Specifically, the researchers will investigate memory layout strategies for irregular meshes based on the theory of decomposition trees, which will lead to algorithms that can effectively exploit both memory hierarchy and parallelism. To investigate how the programming of such complex algorithms can be simplified, they shall investigate and develop a distributed transactional memory library to integrate sharing and synchronization in a cluster programming environment. Developing these computer-science technologies will require substantial technical expertise in the areas of algorithms and computer systems."

For over a year, Seagliders, long-range autonomous underwater vehicles, have been deployed to survey the temperature, salinity, dissolved, oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, and optical backscatter structure of the slope off. Washington. Seagliders have collected data on sections from the continental shelf edge offshore 220 km at fortnightly intervals, reporting back data after each dive, on deployments typically lasting 4-5 months. The objective of the observations has been to detect seasonal and inter-annual variability in this part of the California Current system by collecting highly spatially and temporally resolved observations. Using Seagliders makes possible extended high resolution observations that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive if carried out by ships. This three-year project will: 1) analyze more than 16 months of Seaglider observations already collected, 2) continue the Seaglider observational program to over the continental shelf, and 3) analyze the newly collected data to describe the seasonal and interannual structure of the northern California Current system. Extension in time over the existing Seaglider repeat transects is necessary to confidently describe seasonal and interannual variability in the Cascadia slope region and to resolve and understand the (primarily advective) processes that are responsible for this variability. The data in hand offer tantalizing hints at the low frequency variability, but the 1.5 year record along two cross-slope sections is too limited to support quantitative understanding.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The results from this project will improve physical and biological understanding of climate change. By autonomously measuring important oceanographic parameters over a sustained period of time, it will be possible to establish an unprecedented climate record in an economically important area. By expanding the spatial coverage of the autonomous transects, we will be able to resolve and understand the contribution of advection. The results of this project will benefit resource planners by helping to understand the coastal zone ecosystem and influences of large scale ocean circulation on coastal and estuarine conditions in the Pacific Northwest. We will continue our outreach activities with presentations to local schools, open houses, public talks, and contacts with print and electronic media on local, national and international levels."

Also called type II programmed cell death, autophagy involves recycling of cellular macromolecules and even whole organelles. Most of the molecular components involved have been identified and are highly conserved in species ranging from yeast to man. While autophagy has been studied in several model organisms, almost no information is available on autophagy in filamentous fungi. This is somewhat surprising, as the impact of filamentous fungi on human activity is enormous. While pathogenic fungi are responsible for numerous deaths and billions of dollars in crop damage each year, fungi used in the bioprocessing industry produce billions of dollars in beneficial products annually. Notably, in each of these cases, autophagy appears to play a prominent role. Not only is autophagy likely to be a fundamental response to nutrient limitation, it is hypothesized in this proposal that autophagy is also a normal, developmentally related phenomenon in filamentous fungi that occurs in nutrient rich conditions. Thus, autophagy is likely to have a significant impact on most of the fungal processes related to man.<br/><br/>The broad goal of this proposal is to develop a fundamental understanding of both molecular and cellular level phenomena associated with filamentous fungal autophagy. The function of specific genes, hypothesized to play a role in initiation and regulation of autophagy, will be studied. Because autophagy is likely to be an integral aspect of all fungal processes that affect humans, the fundamental understanding developed here is likely to have broad application. For example, novel components or effectors of the autophagy pathway may represent attractive candidates for the design of antifungal therapeutics. Furthermore, insight into mechanisms that suppress autophagy (either partially or completely) in bioprocesses may lead to increased productivity of secondary metabolites. In both cases, the financial impact would be enormous (billions$/yr). This research will also have broad impact on human capital. PhD level graduate students will conduct research in a cross-disciplinary environment and will be trained in cutting edge techniques. Undergraduates will also be involved in all aspects of the research. In addition, research described here will be incorporated in secondary level outreach modules, enhancing learning for both undergraduates and secondary level students."

The PIs anticipate that the hybrid systems methodology developed will likely have significant impact on modeling, simulating, evaluating, and developing protocols for next-generation heterogeneous internetworks.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The research proposed will produce the scientific foundation for a scalable methodology to study heterogeneous data communication networks. In particular, the project will address the: 1) Development of multi-resolution models for large-scale, heterogeneous communication networks based on a hybrid systems formalism. Multi-resolution is achieved by varying the amount of aggregation enforced and provides the scalability needed to study large-scale, wireless networks. 2) Development of model-based tools for formal analysis of data communication networks, and in particular, for evaluating and tuning network protocols. <br/><br/>The proposers form a multi-disciplinary, multi-university research group with backgrounds in Computer Networks and the Internet (K. Obraczka, UCSC); Computer Networks and Modeling and Simulation (S. Bohacek, UD); and Control Theory and Hybrid Systems (J. Hespanha, UCSB). They have a long history of past collaboration, including joint co-advising of graduate students. In particular, Junsoo Lee, the postdoc to be supported under this supplement, was co-advised by the PIs. This supplement will support Dr. Lee working with and visiting Bell Labs researchers Marina Thottan and Wonsuck Lee who are interested in collaboration so as to adapt the hybrid systems methodology to meet the future needs of Bell Labs and the networking industry.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: This effort will extend the hybrid systems-based simulation tools that were developed under the main part of this effort to networks that include a significant wireless component. These tools will aid the deployment and analysis of next generation networks. This project also has a significant educational component with two main goals:<br/>1) Disseminate to the student population of UCSC, UCSB, and UD the state-of-the-art in network modeling, analysis, and design, in general, and in the research achievements of this project in particular. 2) Attract to this area of research some of the brightest undergraduate students and encourage them to develop the rigorous and analytical thinking required for success in scientific research and also in a professional engineering career. All the results, including papers, reports, and software will be made available freely to the research and industry communities through the World Wide Web. The course materials (including lecturenotes, homeworks, and projects) will also be freely available to the academic community via the Web."

To provide opportunities for associate degree graduates, the Center has supported baccalaureate-level nanotechnology programs at eight Pennsylvania public universities including Penn State, with articulated 2+2 pathways. The Center also offers professional development programs for educators and industry personnel, and outreach programs for secondary school students. Key features of the Center are its broad approach to education in all nanotechnology application areas, and its emphasis on the hands-on laboratory experience provided at the Penn State site of the NSF sponsored National Nanofabrication Infrastructure Network (NNIN).<br/><br/>Evaluation and oversight of Center programs and activities have taken place continuously during the four years of operation. External evaluators including the Western Michigan University and the Center's formal evaluator, Professor Melvin M. Mark, as well as Center staff, have assessed the Center. The NSF National Visiting Committee and a separate industrial advisory board also provide oversight and guidance for the Center. Activities for the renewal period are based on findings from these evaluations and oversight bodies. The activities are:<br/><br/>Curriculum Improvement: Because of the Center's broad approach, nanotechnology is being incorporated into a widening range of degree programs at Center partner institutions, including biology, chemistry, physics, and industrial technology. The Center is continuously updating nanofabrication curricula to accommodate students from increasingly diverse fields.<br/><br/>Development of New Learning Tools: As nanotechnology permeates more areas of education and industry and thereby generates more interest, the limits of the Center's ""centralized facility"" model are becoming apparent. To augment this model, the Center is developing, piloting, and refining hands-on nanotechnology learning activities and instructional materials that can be delivered in classrooms across the state, incorporating web-based remote equipment access.<br/><br/>Outreach and Student Recruitment: Outreach to female and disadvantaged minority communities is ongoing. The Center website is continuously maintained and upgraded, and additional promotional videos are being produced and disseminated. The Center's outreach programs reach large numbers of female and minority secondary students. These students are encouraged toward a goal of increased matriculation into associate degree programs.<br/><br/>Industry Outreach: The Center is expanding efforts to identify Pennsylvania companies using nanotechnology and promote Center students as potential workers for these companies. Further, the Center is undertaking a research effort to improve understanding of employment trends and emerging job opportunities in nanotechnology, and using this information to support outreach and student recruitment efforts.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this renewal proposal lies in its potential to contribute to improved understanding in a number of education-related issue areas such as higher education collaboration, student participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, educator professional development, and others. The proposal will have broad impact because it further develops a proven program addressing the growing need for nanofabrication workers."

Wright, Stevens Institute and Sheng Zhong, State University of New York at Buffalo<br/><br/>The rapid expansion of the Internet has changed the way we communicate, with ever-increasing aspects of our daily life involving computation and data communication. However, many communications protocol designs assume that all participants will follow the specified protocols, and do not maintain their desirable properties if they don't. One approach to this problem is to design for a world in which some parties may maliciously deviate from their protocols in arbitrary ways. However, the resulting designs are typically expensive or impossible to achieve, and in many cases overestimate the kinds of misbehavior one is likely to encounter. Weaker security goals are more achievable, but often underestimate the willingness of participants to cheat.<br/><br/>This project studies an intermediate notion of security, known as incentive compatibility. In many practical settings, it is reasonable to assume that users will tend to act in their own best interests. Therefore, if one can design and use protocols that are incentive-compatible, in that following the protocol produces outcomes for participants at least as good as deviating from the protocol, then one can in many settings avoid misbehavior. Incentive compatibility, which borrows ideas from economics and game theory, is a more finely tunable notion of security than traditional security models, allowing different kinds of participants motivated by different incentives. Such solutions can provide better trust and assurance than protocols secure only against passive adversaries, at a potentially lower cost than protocols secure against an arbitrarily malicious adversary. This allows incentive-compatible protocols to provide the ""right"" level of security, at the ""right"" cost.<br/><br/>Four areas studied are: incentive-compatible ad hoc networks, incentive-compatible data mining, (both of which can significantly benefit from introducing incentive-compatible solutions), testing tools for incentive compatibility, and foundations of incentive compatibility."

This site includes: an existing observing system with power and high bandwidth communications; a dynamic, highly permeable and biogeochemically active seafloor; is in close proximity to the deep ocean, which provides regular exposure to offshore geochemistry and variable physical forcing driven by internal tides and mesoscale eddies; a wide and predictable range of surface wave conditions; and the ability to forecast the arrival of significant surface wave events, thus greatly aiding the planning of experiments, deployment of instruments and implementation of event-driven sampling. The goal of the proposed research is to significantly advance the ability to measure transport of solutes into and out of permeable sediments, examine the seafloor's response to a wide range of physical oceanographic forcing, and determine the pelagic ecosystem response to these processes. The PIs propose to establish an array of physical sensors over depths of 10-40 m, collect high resolution temporal and spatial physical data over a range of oceanographic conditions; measure porewater concentrations of biogeochemically important constituents across the array; measure porewater exchange under a range of conditions, at both sandy and hard-bottom permeable seafloors; compare these porewater-seawater fluxes with those calculated using eddy correlation and water column profiling techniques; examine the optical (biological) response in the water column to physically driven sediment fluxes of nutrients; and determine the dynamics of the CO2 system in the surface water. Together, these tasks will enable them to resolve the physical and geochemical responses of benthic boundary layer systems in response to environmental changes."

The goal is to improve undergraduate student recruitment and retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs with an emphasis on students from under-represented groups, including women, minorities and students with disabilities. It responds to national concerns about the need to increase the number of undergraduate students obtaining degrees in STEM areas, as well as the local college-level concern about high attrition in entry-level science courses.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: To accomplish its objectives, Project Pathways is increasing the number of students pursuing STEM degrees by providing: 1) educational outreach at the pre-college level, 2) interdisciplinary, inquiry based curricula enhancements through professional development workshops and retreats for high school teachers and community college and university faculty/administrators, 3) specialized recruitment of underrepresented students across STEM disciplines, and 4) early undergraduate research experience. The extensive partnering and collaboration on this project permits Pathways' students to have access to an unusual set of resources, in particular, the College's scanning electron microscope, a research instrument rarely located in a community college, and community-based research in places such as The Big Thicket National Preserve. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The project serves as a model for other academic institutions trying to address similar concerns. Over five years, the project's specific objectives are to: 1) increase the number of students with a declared STEM field by 25%; 2) Increase the retention rate of STEM students by 20%; 3) increase the number of students who graduate with a STEM degree and/or transfer to a four-year institutions as STEM majors by 15%; and 4) increase the number of underrepresented groups majoring in STEM by 15%."

The hypothesis is that sacred values - which encompass aspects of what philosophers, political scientists, sociologists, anthropologists and psychologists call moral, non-instrumental or protected values - are critical in generating and sustaining culturally distinct and often conflicting political and resource-management systems that people deem essential to cultural survival. To better understand and deal with this issue, the research: 1) provides a comprehensive theoretical framework and wide-ranging empirical analysis of the role of sacred values in judgment and decision making, and 2) shows how sacred values inform issues relating to cultural conflict. Results are geared to: 3) further possibilities for negotiation and adjudication of conflicting values over transcultural boundaries, and 4) reduce the threat of violence as people attempt to implement these values in an increasingly global competition for political, social and economic resources.<br/><br/>Current risk management approaches to resolving resource conflicts or countering terrorism often assume adversaries model the world on the basis of rational choices that are commensurable across cultures. Such assumptions are prevalent in risk assessment and modeling by foreign aid and international development projects run by institutions such as the World Bank and many NGOs, and by U.S. diplomatic, military and intelligence services as well. Psychological experiments, anthropological fieldwork and political science surveys relating to social conflicts over natural resources and terrorism encourage exploration of whether culturally distinct value frameworks constrain preferences and choices in ways not readily translatable (fungible, substitutable) across frameworks. Planning and acting in ignorance or disregard of different value frameworks may exacerbate conflict, with grievous loss of national treasure and lives."

Fundamental to many of these studies is a mass spectrometric-assisted proteomic analysis of the cells, tissues and organs that make up the organisms. The UW -Madison Biotechnology Center Mass Spectrometry/Proteomic Facility was established in 1998 as a centralized facility for the purpose of acquiring mass spectrometers and making them available to the research community on a fee-for-service basis. During the six years since inception, it has proven successful in meeting the proteomic needs of nearly one hundred different academic laboratories in a cost effective, top quality manner. However, a major deficiency for investigators using this facility has been the inability to obtain protein sequence from very small samples of tissue, a common handicap of biological research. A second limitation is the ability to routinely perform quantitative differential proteomic experiments using isotope-assisted tandem mass spectrometry. The MALDI-based tandem mass spectrometer known commonly as a MALDI-TOFTOF is an instrument that is uniquely capable to address both of these problems. Surprisingly, there is not a single MALDI-TOFTOF available in the state. Wisconsin researchers currently must drive/fly to Chicago or Boston to obtain precious instrument time. Lack of ready access to this instrument locally has hindered our researchers in obtaining the critical information needed for converting genomic sequence 'data' into a real understanding of life processes. The purpose of this award is to acquire this instrument and make it available to academic researchers statewide. The instrument will be placed within the existing UWBC Core Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics Facility, ensuring that (i) it will be accessible to a large diverse group of researchers, (ii) that it will heavily used and (iii) that it will be well maintained for optimal sensitivity and overall reliability. <br/><br/> The broader impacts of this project are several-fold. First, the research users represent a large number of different academic disciplines, from Animal/Food Science to Engineering to Prebiotic Chemistry to the 'traditional' Molecular, Cellular and Organismal Biology areas. Six years of prior experience in operating expensive and sophisticated mass spectrometers ensures that the operation of this MALDI-TOFTOF will be well organized, accessible and affordable for the entire community. In addition, the university has strived to ensure that the UWBC core facilities in general, and the Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics in particular, are utilized for education at all levels, including undergraduates and high schools, both locally and in Wisconsin communities with underrepresented groups, such as economically impoverished schools in Milwaukee and Native American Indians in small communities of northern Wisconsin. This instrument will advance discovery and promote teaching and generally enhance the academic infrastructure, not only at UW-Madison, but also, all over the state."

These processes include bio-physical interactions, socio-economic dynamics, the role of social institutions and organizations in shaping human adaptation. Resilience in these systems is the amount of disturbance to individual or multiple components that can be accommodated without change to alternative domains. The overarching goal of this project is to improve understanding of the relative resilience and adaptability of regional Human-Rangifer Systems to forces of global change, and to derive generalized propositions about their functional properties as critical aspects of the Arctic System. This study of resilience goes beyond the regional analyses of Human-Rangifer Systems considered in past studies, to address the heterogeneity present in the drivers and responses found across the circumpolar North. This circum-arctic synthesis undertakes a comparative retrospective analysis of six regional case studies in North America and Russia. The project develops a conceptual framework for measuring and assessing resilience in three components of the Human-Rangifer System: ecological processes, socio-economic processes, and institutional processes. In addition, simple synthesis models will be developed and simulated to examine resilience in each subcomponent process interactions, as well as in the coupled social-ecological system. This project is the first to provide a comprehensive synthesis of heterogeneity and resilience of Human-Rangifer Systems, and the first such project to predict means of accommodating changes in drivers and enhancing resilience of Human-Rangifer systems in the circumpolar North."

Starting from detailed descriptions of composite media, permeability models will be developed, which will be used to fully define the effective permeability field at length scales typical of computer aided design. The approach is to use high-performance parallel super-computing to solve the equations of fluid flow in microstructures of realistic complexity. This involves solutions of very large systems of equations and will be achieved using novel algorithms for fast, parallel computation. Upscaling will be achieved using analytical and numerical Monte-Carlo stochastic techniques.<br/><br/>This research will enable the design of novel and defect-free composites molding manufacturing processes that, instead of being limited by the heterogeneous nature of the material, take full advantage of it to create unique products with tailored property profiles. Ability to accomplish this will provide the US industry with a currently unavailable and significant competitive advantage. Technology transfer will be enhanced by collaboration between the PIs and DOE National labs as well as by the co-funding of the project by NSF as DOE's FreedomCAR program. In addition, the parallel supercomputing aspects of this work fit well with the need to support cutting edge research on high-performance computing in order to maintain and expand the Nation's lead in this important area. Educational impact is assured by ongoing participation at National and Regional undergraduate research programs, including programs targeting minorities."

In the atmosphere, stratification results from solar heating coupled with earth's gravity, whereby colder, heavier air settles below warmer, lighter air. In the ocean, colder, saltier water lies below warmer, fresher water. The relative importance of both rotation and stratification depends on length and time scales. For example, the earth's rotation is critical to the dynamics of large-scale structures such as hurricanes, jet streams, and oceanic currents, but has a minor effect on smaller-scale motions such as cumulus clouds and waves generated by a ship.<br/><br/>The wide range of spatial scales in geophysical flows, from thousands of kilometers to meters, is one reason why they are so rich in behavior, so costly to compute, and so difficult to understand. In certain scale regimes, intermediate-scale motions self-organize to generate larger-scale structures such as hurricanes, while in other regimes, energy is transferred from large-scale winds and tides to small-scale turbulent fluctuations. On large scales the flow becomes quasi-two-dimensional, with motions mainly parallel to the surface of the earth, whereas at small scales it is often fully turbulent in all three directions. Current mathematical models for studying the oceans and the atmosphere capture the large scales of the flow at the expense of removing small-scale dynamics. Even at the highest resolutions possible on today's computers, these models fail to accurately predict long-term variability. For example, in thousand-year ocean simulations, significant errors accumulate over time because of inadequate representation of small-scale processes such as deep-water mixing and dense-water overflows (e.g., from the Denmark Strait). Such errors indicate a significant obstacle for our ability to predict climate change, since breakdowns in the large-scale ocean circulation have previously occurred during relatively rapid changes in climate. Thus it is becoming increasingly clear that the intermediate-scale and small-scale motions play a significant role in long-time, large-scale dynamics.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to probe the mechanisms for such multi-scale coupling in rotating and stratified flows. Mathematical models and a new statistical framework will be developed and tested with computer simulations on some of the largest available computers in the world at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Our combined theoretical and numerical approach provides a unique opportunity for the training of young scientists toward development of the next generation of ocean, atmosphere, and climate models."

The project will provide a controlled test of the claim that bridging cultural differences in how one understands science will lead to improved learning of science content knowledge. The PIs' previous research with the Menominee has indicated that rural Native-American children begin school with a relatively precocious understanding of biology, but that this initial knowledge of the natural world does not translate into superior learning in traditional science curricula. On standardized tests Menominee children score above the national average in science in fourth grade, but by eighth grade it is their worst subject. The PIs explore the hypothesis that Native-American practices may clash with the cultural context and methodology used in the formal teaching of science. The proposal includes studies that will explore the educational relevance of cultural differences in approaches to the teaching of science and it includes the design, implementation, and evaluation of an after-school program. The initial studies will continue the researchers efforts to identify barriers to Native-American science learning and to develop and test strategies for building on the cultural knowledge that Native-American children bring to the classroom. Research on children's folkbiology has been conducted almost exclusively with individuals from urban North American populations. The proposed research will bring more evidence to bear on the problem of science learning in minority culture contexts."

This is largely due to the difficulty of integrating molecular biological-based community composition measurements into an oceanographic measurement program, even though recent data imply that microbial diversity should strongly affect many biogeochemical processes. New developments in whole-community molecular fingerprinting approaches and high throughput sequence analysis make such integration possible. In this project, the PIs will evaluate microbial community diversity in the context of environmental data, as a critical first step toward relating molecular genetic data to processes that may be represented in conceptual and numerical models of the ocean. The project is very cost effective because no additional fieldwork is requested. Instead, the PIs will use existing high quality biological oceanographic data from predominantly subtropical or tropical regions. Samples come from the SW Pacific around Australia, the North Pacific from Hawaii to Empress Seamount, the W Tropical Atlantic including the Amazon Plume, the Gulf of Mexico on the West Florida Shelf, and the San Pedro Ocean Time Series between Los Angeles and Santa Catalina Island. Molecular and oceanographic data will be analyzed by multivariate statistical techniques including ordination, cluster, and canonical analysis. Questions to be addressed include: Do physico-chemical parameters structure microbial communities? Do some microbial taxa appear together regularly, and are some taxa mutually exclusive? Can correlations be used to connect certain taxa to specific biogeochemical processes? The project includes a significant exploratory component, and is expected to generate numerous specific hypotheses to test. The results will be digitally archived and can be integrated with new data on marine microbial diversity as it becomes available. Broader impacts of the project include a connection to K-12 teaching through USC's COSEE West program, undergraduate and graduate student teaching and research, and outreach to the general public through a website."

This mobility, however, has brought with it a growing number of unintended consequences in the form of pollution, climate change, urban sprawl, congestion, injuries, fatalities and economic inequality. The sustainable accessibility challenge is to ensure that future generations have access to adequate resources to meet their mobility needs and aspirations while maintaining the integrity and resilience of supporting environmental and social systems. The challenge calls for an integrative and systematic approach, not the undirected incrementalist approach currently in place. This project is a group modeling process to construct a comprehensive computer model of the co-evolutionary dynamics of technological transitions toward sustainable transport fuels. The model will be constructed to explore the competitive and collaborative interaction among transitions pursuing improved end-use efficiency, increased use of renewables, and development/diffusion of cleaner advanced fossil energy technologies. Dynamic interactions will be appraised according to the normative objective of sustainability. The modeling team will construct an interrelated set of multiagent-based and system dynamics-based models following the iterative process of problem articulation, formulation of dynamic hypotheses, formulation of the simulation models, model testing and validation, and policy interpretation and evaluation. The model will interlink the probable innovation cycles (i.e., R&D, demonstration, early deployment, wider diffusion) of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, bio-fuel powered vehicles, and hybrid-powered vehicles, all in comparison to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. The key element in the construction, analysis and application of this overarching model of fuel and vehicle choices is the building of a Sustainable Mobility and Accessibility Learning Community (SMALC). The general goal of SMALC is to work collaboratively and cumulatively over the grant period (and beyond) to produce a rigorous understanding of the complex system dynamics of transitions toward sustainable mobility and accessibility. The particular goal is to use the model(s) we build to improve both collective foresight capacity (predicting how mobility/accessibility systems might behave in the future under a variety of assumed conditions and plausible scenarios) and policy analysis (designing new strategies, policies and interventions and evaluating their effects on the behavior of the mobility/accessibility systems over time, space and scale)."

Over the period 1995-2003, China raised its R&D/GDP ratio from 0.6 percent to 1.3 percent. This abrupt increase shares features of the historic trajectories of large OECD countries that on average in the space of a decade raised their R&D intensities from less than one percent to more than two percent. The central objective of the project is to deepen understanding of the factors that are driving the diffusion and intensification of R&D effort in China's economy. To investigate these factors, the project extends its empirical base along two dimensions: (i) for China's 22,000 large and medium-size enterprises, the National Bureau of Statistics has agreed to add the data for 2002-2006 (in addition to the data used previously for 1995-2001), and (ii) the Ministry of Science and Technology has agreed to provide its data base that covers China's approximately 4,500 research institutes for the years 1995-2003. The latter data have never before been used for systematic economic research. Together these data sets, which cover nearly three-quarters of China's total R&D spending, will allow for a comprehensive and detailed investigation of the theoretical and empirical sources of the diffusion and intensification of R&D effort. <br/>The research promises substantial intellectual merit. The project will extend and apply aspects of the body of endogenous growth literature to explain the causes of the rapid rise in R&D intensity in a significant economy - that of China. Specifically, the research will study the role of four key factors in driving China's abrupt rise in R&D intensity. These are: (i) the shift in demand toward technology intensive goods and services, (ii) investment in complements to R&D, which raise the productivity of R&D personnel, (iii) international technology diffusion, which by extending the pool of knowledge expands the capacity for imitation and innovation in China, and (iv) an emerging wage-productivity gap, which results from the rise in the productivity of R&D personnel in relation to the compensation they receive thus providing an effective subsidy to R&D investment. The project will also examine the pattern and speed of diffusion of R&D activity from China's technology intensive centers to lagging areas. The extensive panels of firm and research institute panel data will allow for using a variety of panel data techniques to address issues of selection bias, endogeneity, and time structure. By focusing on China, this research investigates a pattern of R&D intensification associated with sustained S&T takeoff in large OECD countries that may now be emerging in China, Brazil, and India, whose R&D/GDP ratios have all recently reached or exceeded one percent. This tendency for R&D spending to grow more rapidly than GDP has broad implications for these large countries, which account for 40 percent of the world's population. Research in this area that documents, analyzes, and explains patterns of R&D intensification based on rich sets of firm and research institute data will likely motivate broad intellectual interest and follow-up research internationally that focuses on the causes and consequences of abrupt increases in sectoral, regional, and national R&D effort. This work grows out of research that has been supported by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. The proposed project would not be possible without the data set up, the research network, and the intellectual capital provided by the initial project. In addition to on-going collaborations with China's National Bureau of Statistics and researchers from Dartmouth College, the National University of Singapore, and Peking University, the project will be extending its research network to include the National Research Center for Science and Technology Development in China's Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Entrepreneurship Center and a team of researchers from Tsinghua University. <br/>The project promises to sustain and extend its broad impacts in the following six areas: (i) a deeper understanding of the sources of China's rapid increase in R&D intensity and its impacts on technical change and economic growth in that country that will be disseminated to a broad audience of international scholars with interests in the phenomenon of S&T takeoff and China's growing technological capabilities, (ii) an expanded appreciation by the staff and leadership in the collaborating Chinese agencies of the research and policy benefits resulting from the collection and analysis of the data they collect, (iii) introduction into the research community of data sets that are of extraordinary potential for the study of China's enterprise and research sectors, (iv) continuing improvements in these data sets in order to facilitate their usefulness for research and policy analysis, (v) training and research opportunities in the fields of R&D, technical change, and economic growth for young Chinese PhDs, scholars starting academic careers, and staff in important Chinese agencies, and (vi) collaboration between elements of the U.S. and China's research and policy establishments that share interest and responsibility for understanding and coordinating technology development in these two countries."

The goals include increasing the number of minority students enrolled, the establishment of permanent infrastructure on each campus to support diversity, the establishment of permanent programs on each campus and across the alliance to support diversity and a diverse population of graduate students, and the development of a publishable set of techniques and guidelines that can be used by any university and which we hope will lead to a national forum for the exchange of ideas and best practices for promoting diversity. The four key elements of the alliance include: 1) alliance-level activities (e.g., an annual student research conference and the creation of common recruiting materials and coordinated recruiting efforts; 2) recruitment through the implementation of an Alliance Visiting Scholars Program and coordination of recruiting efforts at major conferences, fairs and university visits; 3) increased retention of students by recruiting a cadre of social and behavioral professors and scholars who will provide instant, multi-level mentoring network and developing transition programs; and 4) increased activities and programs targeted at undergraduates in a wider range of universities and colleges to increase the pool of students. The number of universities in the alliance will allow the alliance to analyze the effectiveness of new strategies for broadening participation and the transference of existing techniques to new settings. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The alliance will develop written materials that can be distributed to all universities in the US and could be the basis for a national exchange of ideas about alliances as a strategy to broaden participation in US institutions of higher learning."

The system includes a machine learning facility - called the Simulated Student - that generates a ""cognitive model"" which can perform the subject task just as students do. The Simulated Student learns the production rules in the cognitive model much like a human student: by observing examples of worked-out problem solutions, reading associated instructions, and getting feedback on solution attempts. The author provides the examples, English instructions, and solution feedback, and thus acts more like a teacher than a programmer. In this way, the Simulated Student allows authors to bypass the time-consuming and difficult-to-learn programming that is currently required to build the Cognitive Model component of a Cognitive Tutor. The key technology behind Simulated Students is programming by demonstration, in which machine learning is integrated tightly into a user interface. We plan to use learning methods based on Inductive Logic Programming and Statistical Relational Learning. With the proposed Intelligent Authoring System, an author will perform the following steps to build a tutor: (1) build a graphic user interface (GUI) for the tutor; (2) demonstrate solutions, by solving problems with the GUI and annotating steps with instructional messages, thus providing training data for the Simulated Student to learn production rules that replicate the demonstrations; and (3) test the production rules and giving the Simulated Student feedback on its solutions for another set of problems.<br/>This effort builds upon a suite of Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT), which includes a built-in GUI builder, a facility to demonstrate solution steps and recode them, and facilities to write and test production rules. The proposed Intelligent Authoring System will be implemented by integrating the Simulated Student into CTAT, so all three authoring steps will be a natural extension of existing authoring tools. This project has broader impacts in advancing intelligent systems technology and in providing better cognitive tutors by allowing teachers to be authors."

One of these compounds is indole-3-acetic acid, an important member of the class of plant growth regulators called auxins. Indole-3-acetic acid is synthesized by virtually all plant species. In the cruciferous plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, tryptophan is also used to produce the plant defense compounds indole glucosinolates (IGs) and camalexin. There is evidence in Arabidopsis for intricate cross-talk between the biosynthetic pathways used to produce these different tryptophan-derived compounds. The secondary metabolite profile in the non-crucifer tobacco does not include IGs or camalexin. Thus, tobacco provides a tractable alternative model system in which Trp metabolism can be compared to that of Arabidopsis.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand how the interactions among tryptophan metabolism pathways are the same or different between Arabidopsis and other plant species that do not produce the same spectrum of tryptophan-derived compounds as Arabidopsis. The research scope of this project is twofold:<br/>1) Use previously identified mutant plants perturbed in tryptophan metabolism to define the role of compounds predicted to serve as intermediate steps for the biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid. In addition, new mutants disrupted in these metabolic pathways will be identified.<br/>2) Determine which known indole-3-acetic acid biosynthetic pathways contribute to the formation of a chemically distinct naturally occurring auxin called indole-3-butyric acid. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include the training of graduate students in biochemical and genetic methodologies. This training will prepare them for more advanced positions in the fields of plant biochemistry and metabolomics. In addition, this research will be carried out as collaboration among three institutions (University of Massachusetts Amherst, Boston University and Lincoln University) that are partner institutions in an NSF-supported alliance designed to increase the number of minorities in the professoriate of science technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Interactions between the three labs will be facilitated by having students from Lincoln University participate in ongoing summer minority research programs in the laboratories of the PIs from University of Massachusetts and Boston University. Co-mentorship of Lincoln University students among the three PIs will facilitate the identification, recruiting and mentoring of minority students with an interest in plant biology graduate programs."

The principal scientific goal is<br/>to better understand the recently discovered phenomenon of episodic slip transients<br/>and its role in either relieving or increasing strain accumulating along the seismogenic<br/>portion of a subduction interface. A pilot study during the past year shows that such<br/>transients are occurring as frequently as every 12-24 months in this region, that<br/>some transients (1998 and 2004) originate far outside the Guerrero seismic gap, and<br/>that the transients may be accompanied by non-volcanic seismic tremors. Based on these<br/>previously unrecognized results, deployment for 24 months of an 8-station broadband<br/>seismic array and expansion of a regional continuous GPS array to include 4 critically<br/>located stations in a region where the transients appear to occur are planned. The<br/>new seismic array, which will span a<br/>broad gap between two dense seismic transects being installed as part of the already<br/>funded Caltech/UNAM Middle America Seismic Experiment, will allow detection and location<br/>of any episodic tremors in the study area. Continuous GPS measurements from the<br/>pre-existing GPS stations and nine new stations constructed by this group and<br/>collaborator Enrique Cabral of UNAM will provide critical complementary information<br/>about the source regions, magnitude, and timing of episodic slip. Data from an existing<br/>smaller-footprint 30-station continuous and campaign GPS array that DeMets and Cabral<br/>operate in Oaxaca above the Cocos-North America subduction interface will also be used<br/>to study in more detail deformation within a conspicuous seismic gap analogous to,<br/>but smaller than the well-known Guerrero seismic gap. The combined GPS and seismic<br/>arrays will be a powerful tool for studying subduction transients and non-volcanic<br/>tremor, and for imaging spatial and temporal variations in frictional coupling<br/>along the locked and transitional zones beneath our network. Brudzinski, who will be<br/>a new faculty member at Miami University of Ohio in August of 2005, will purchase the<br/>necessary seismic equipment with start-up funds from his faculty position and will<br/>have it prepared for a two-year deployment in early 2006. DeMets at UW-Madison will<br/>coordinate the GPS station installation with Dr. Cabral, as well as a modest expansion<br/>of the Oaxaca GPS network to improve coverage of the aforementioned seismic gap. The<br/>UW-Madison geophysics group has a long history of deploying seismic and GPS networks<br/>and will provide at no cost two expert technicians to help build and maintain the<br/>combined seismic and GPS network. Responsibilities for modeling of the geodetic and<br/>seismic observations will lie respectively with DeMets and Brudzinski.<br/>Broader impacts: Episodic tremor and slip are a newly observed phenomenon that appears<br/>to be related to many different aspects of earth science (seismology, tectonics,<br/>petrology, and geodynamics), with possible ramifications for understanding triggering<br/>of megathrust earthquakes. Students at Miami University will be offered a unique opportunity<br/>to participate in a field workshop course that will coincide with the initial seismic<br/>deployment, thereby exposing students to a geophysics field research. Broader impacts at<br/>UW-Madison will include education of Mexican graduate student Francisco Correa-Mora,<br/>who will do a substantial portion of his dissertation research on the mechanics of<br/>subduction along the Middle America trench. The availability of new continuous and<br/>campaign GPS and seismic data to the broader geophysical community will also<br/>extend the impact of this work beyond our group, particularly once future transient<br/>slip episodes and/or tremor sequences are recorded."

This may be the result of national legislative efforts starting in the 1960s. Firms no longer engage in one particular form of differential treatment of men and women. Former socialist societies in Eastern Europe were committed to the principles of gender equality and the gender wage gap generally was known under socialism to be smaller than in the West. What has happened after transition from socialism to market economies is however highly contested and not known. As a backlash against socialist ideologies gender equality and affirmative action efforts became weaker or non-existent and some researchers hence claim gender inequalities-along with race, ethnicity, and class-based inequalities-grew fast. This project will investigate the gender gaps in the workplace in former socialist economies. The PI hypothesizes first, that one main source of gender inequality in the workplace-namely, unequal pay for equal work-a source that has gradually disappeared in some mature market economies, have reemerged in post-socialist economies, even when the source, was absent during state socialism. Second, that there are sex differences in wage changes, promotions, and career advancement. The project will investigate these issues using unique firm-level data on about 1.1 million employees in the Czech Republic for the period 1998-2004.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The research will contribute to our understanding of the effects of large-scale social transformations, for example, the process by which major social change contributes to significant setbacks in previously achieved civil rights goals. Specifically, the way in which legislative and other efforts can impact the restoration of equal pay for equal work, which is what was once the case in former socialist economies, and is largely the case in the U.S. today."

This research aims at building time-varying 3D models that can serve to pull together large collections of images pertaining to the appearance, evolution, and events surrounding one place or artifact over time, as exemplified by the ""4D City"" project: the completely automatic construction of a 4D database showing the evolution over time of a single city.<br/>In terms of intellectual merits, the project will advance the state of the art in (1) single-view image interpretation for matching scene structure across space and time; (2) model-based, probabilistic inference and stochastic grammars to encode high-level prior knowledge; and (3) introducing time as an additional object of inference.<br/>The project is expected to broadly impact society in the areas of urban planning, historical education, research, and preservation. In addition, the newly developed algorithms can be applied in other application areas such as forensics and intelligence gathering.

Over 76% of electric energy in the U.S. is supplied by coal, gas, or water. These three raw energy forms, together with electricity, have the common characteristic that they can be moved in bulk quantities via a transportation system from their source of production to where they are used. Coal is mainly moved by train and barge; gas by pipelines; water by rivers and reservoir systems; and electricity by transmission lines. The pattern of movement from raw energy source to power plants to electric distribution substations of the many different U.S. load centers is determined by a complicated decision-making process comprised of many different organizations. Our research objective, therefore, is to develop decision models to address three related areas of questions: (1) What energy flow patterns would yield significantly improved energy system performance? What operational production and/or transportation changes need to be made to realize these improvements? (2) What infrastructure weaknesses exist? What infrastructure enhancements would realize the most performance benefit? (3) How well can we predict the influence of market design changes on energy system performance? We will develop two types of models to answer these questions. A structural-optimization model will enable mid-term (1 month to 2 years) simulation of the energy systems, their physical infrastructure, and their associated market flows. A behavioral model will focus on the market network overlaying the structural model. Market participants are modeled as strategic energy traders having the ability to act autonomously and learn from the influence of their previous decisions. These two models interact through energy price/quantity/location/time bids and offers generated by the trader-agents. We will use a participatory model development process in which we repeatedly loop through fieldwork, model design and development, and computational experiments. Of particular interest are structural and social factors constraining and shaping the decision-making processes of raw-fuel production and transportation firms as well as firms engaged in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. This knowledge will be used to guide the development of the structural and market models and hence to improve the ability of these models to provide accurate system performance assessments. We will thereby gain better understanding of the social and structural factors affecting the decision-making processes of system participants and the willingness of system participants to adopt new structures and procedures to improve the efficiency of the energy transmission system.<br/>The modeling developed and analysis performed in this research will enable systematic examination of nationwide bulk energy production and transportation decisions and consequently reveal efficiencies in operational and facility investment having very large national economic impact. In addition, it will expose energy system vulnerabilities, leading to an energy system design and analysis approach that accounts for uncertainties and disruptions to steer reliability enhancement and market design. These efforts will result in characterization of energy system human decision processes at organizational and cognitive levels, extending knowledge of human dynamics in decision-making related to high-stress situations affecting a national critical infrastructure, while deepening the understanding of practical and conceptual relations between advanced network optimization and software agents. The culmination of this work will include a sound and robust suite of models and accompanying modeling methods for study, analysis, and design of the integrated energy system, together with its markets. Such public domain, open-source availability of tools and methods will have significant effect on stimulating and encouraging further university-based research and education in this area, bridging separate fields (power systems, sociology, decision-science, and economics) in new ways that will contribute to enriching education and research in each of the areas."

(ii) which imaging algorithms are capable of processing the received signals and produce reconstructed images in realistic time frame? The investigators are proposing to build an advanced ultra wideband compact imaging sensor that is specifically designed for breast cancer imaging. This sensor will be an antenna array composed of dielectric wideband elements. Each element will be a dielectric resonator antenna that can be flexible in shape, small in size and light in weight, making the sensor practical for use on the breast. Also, the investigators are proposing to develop and hybridize potential imaging algorithms to efficiently and rapidly reconstruct the tumor shape and location using received signals. The intellectual merits of this proposal focus on designing and building an advanced compact ultra wideband lightweight microwave sensor; developing efficient and robust imaging algorithms to be integrated with the hardware part of the system; and validating the developed algorithms on real data to be collected by the sensors. The proposed hardware sensor will be used to validate the imaging algorithm and once proven successful the investigators will seek funding in collaboration with medical researchers for clinical use. <br/>The broader impact of this project will be on women's health in general and on breast cancer disease in particular. The new system will offer an economical and less painful option for many women.

This research project addresses cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary perspectives of faculty and graduate students on ethical issues relevant to the graduate education of scientists and engineers. The research team, composed of an engineer, a philosopher and a psychologist, is qualitatively assessing the delivery of the research in the classroom by focusing on several questions: Can cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary perspectives be readily discovered in individuals? If so, How? Can they be brought together with ethical theories into a coherent and justifiable whole? If so, How? Can that whole be applied to the ethical decision making of individuals seeking to function harmoniously in multi-cultural and multi-disciplinary communities? If so, How? These research questions are being examined with five objectives. First is the three-year research objective to produce study modules each consisting of an ethical topic in either science or engineering (S&E), cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary perspectives of individuals on that topic, and a systematic arrangement of each individual perspective and that topic into a prescription for behavior that can be accommodated in multi-cultural, multi-disciplinary, US communities. Second is the three-year research and education objective to conduct a seminar series bringing external experts to the project and culminating at the end of the third year in a major national symposium. Third is the educational objective to conduct workshops in the second year on modules for lecturers in ethics to graduate students. Fourth is the educational objective in the third year to observe as lecturers deliver modules to graduate students. Fifth is the publication of all modules in a textbook for the ethics instruction of S&E graduate students. The chief activity of this project is the development of a narrative approach to the first objective. This approach combines previous works published by the three principal participants of this project on (1) the uses by psychologists of auto-biographies to discover African American ethnic factors of self-identity, (2) the uses of mythic stories to discover heroes in one's own family or ancestry identified as African American engineers judged, by reference to African experiences, worthy of imitation in Western ethical situations, and (3) the comparison of African and Western ethics and the accommodation of African ethics to Western values. This project will extend these works to include Asian, Indian, Hispanic and other perspectives, and to adapt them to ethical problems in S&E. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is in the development of a coherent arrangement of a narrative theory of personality, the mythic story, and comparative ethics, and in the application of that arrangement to practical problems in science and engineering. This is a novel activity promising to enhance the ethical decision making skills of individual scientists and engineers without requiring them to become specialist experts on ethical theory and argumentation. Rather, compensation for this specialty is made on the presumption that most of them are already generalist experts on believable stories. The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity will be on the globalization process and the fitness of the US participatory democracy to govern its technological society. The cross-cultural empowerment promised by this project to scientists and engineers will ready them for the challenges of globalization, and the cross-disciplinary empowerment promised by it will ready them for effective leadership in academia, the professional, governmental, and business sectors of society, and in the decision making venues open to citizens, experts and non-experts in technological democracies."

Using computed conformal structures, new geometry<br/>representation and analysis tools can be developed, which will pave<br/>the road for advances in multiple fronts of science and<br/>engineering. The work proposed herein will especially explore these<br/>potentials in computer graphics and visualization. Building up<br/>conformal structures recasts many three dimensional (3D) geometric<br/>problems into two dimensions (2D) and leads to efficient approaches<br/>for a number of fundamental geometric problems. These approaches can<br/>then immediately benefit a wide range of applications, such as<br/>surface classification, surface matching and shape analysis,<br/>geometric modeling, simulation, graphics rendering and<br/>visualization. Performing conformal parameterization requires<br/>solving large least squares problems. To further push the<br/>application of the conformal structure to interactive or time<br/>critical operations, the research team will investigate novel<br/>iterative methods for least-squares problems based on sparse QR and<br/>incomplete sparse QR algorithms.<br/><br/>Various scientific and engineering applications concern about key<br/>operations such as modeling, design, analysis, simulation, and<br/>graphics rendering. All these operations are built on top a<br/>foundation of geometry representation. In this project, scientists<br/>aim to revolutionize this foundation by introducing a conformal<br/>structure uniquely characterizing geometry surfaces. Many laws of<br/>physics are governed by conformal structures. For example, heat<br/>diffusion and electromagnetic field distribution on surfaces,<br/>tension in soap bubbles and parts of string theory in theoretical<br/>physics are determined by conformal surface structures. Encouraged<br/>by the existing success, the scientists strive to explore and unveil<br/>the potentials of conformal structures for computer graphics,<br/>geometric modeling and much of scientific computing. To illustrate<br/>this potential, consider one aspect of conformal structures, namely<br/>the canonical flattening of a surface into a plane, resulting in an<br/>image like representation of seemingly complicated three dimensional<br/>geometry. Overall, the tools developed in this project can help<br/>boost the development of effective techniques to deal with the<br/>emerging problems related to scientific simulation, data<br/>exploration, and identity matching or shape analysis for<br/>surveillance and biological discovery."

The project is adapting a series of exemplary instructional practices from the literatures on geoscience, physics, and astronomy education. The first course is an inquiry-based introductory course in planetary science, in which students will collect spectral data on local rock units using hand-held reflectance spectrometers, and conduct spectroscopic measurements by telescope. The second course focuses on the petrologic study of meteorites, lunar samples, and terrestrial rocks. The third course is an upper-level offering on the spectroscopy of the planets, that makes in-depth use of tools introduced in the two previous courses. The project assessment plan tracks student academic performance in the new courses, as well as their performance in the upper-level courses in physics and geology that follow them. Student recruitment and retention in astronomy and geology degree programs, as well as in the new planetary program, are also being measured. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project lies in the crossing of boundaries between geology, physics, and astronomy, as a means of bringing students to these disciplines. These courses are modeling successful teaching practices, and inspire students to undertake further study in related fields. The broader impact of this project lies in bringing female students into these three STEM fields, where women are under-represented."

They are active in altering soil structure and nutrient availability in soils throughout the world, and known for their utility in composting. Earthworms harbor symbiotic bacteria of the Acidovorax genus in their internal kidney-like organs, the nephridia (ca. 200 per worm), that eliminate waste fluid (""urine""). Unlike the diverse microbiota of the gut, bacteria of the nephridia appear to form stable and specific associations such that particular species of earthworms harbor their own species of symbiotic Acidovorax. In addition, a second bacterial symbiont related to Actinobacteria was recently discovered in Eisenia fetida, suggesting even greater diversity among earthworm symbionts. The diversity of the bacteria associated with different earthworm taxa and their contribution to the success of earthworms are virtually unexplored. This collaborative research project integrates morphological identification and genetic sequence information to identify earthworms and their associated symbiotic bacteria from several continents. A suite of genes that have shown previous success in determining relationships among organisms has been selected to be sequenced. The data will be used to determine the genetic relationships among both the host earthworms and their bacterial partners to establish evolutionary patterns for this association. Discovery of novel species of both the host and symbiont is expected as well as a better understanding of the diversity of the earthworms and their associated bacteria. This research is crucial for understanding the processes occurring in the soil that influence soil chemistry and fertility through the activity of these widespread members of soil systems. Furthermore, one of the symbiotic bacterial lineages may be a source of novel anti-microbial compounds. The diversity and global distribution of earthworms offers an opportunity for the evolution of bacterial symbionts with potential for new bioactive compounds and enzymes.<br/><br/>International collaborations are a necessary part of the research to accomplish collections from several continents and contribute to an international effort to accumulate sequences for rapid organism identification (""BarCode of Life""). The work will engage and provide training to young scientists in field collection, molecular methods for phylogenetic systematics and bacterial community analysis."

This project is adapting a social cognitive self-regulated learning model to assist students to develop and assess their SRL skills more effectively. For six years, the SRL program at NYCCT has concentrated on developing students' metacognitive skills in ways that enable them to become motivated, goal-oriented, resilient, and successful. Using the SRL model as a framework, a variety of instructional interventions have been implemented with successful outcomes for first-year students enrolled in remedial math and writing courses. The SRL program has also incorporated the use of technology by developing a SRL software application for personal digital assistants and a student-focused SRL website. This project is building on earlier initiatives by developing and implementing an individualized SRL assessment system for a sequence of first-year electromechanical courses. Many incoming students at institutions like NYCCT are academically under prepared, resulting in high rates of poor academic achievement and attrition. (Within the school's EM program, only 15% of the students earn an associate degree within 5 years.) Students who become skilled self-regulated learners develop a greater understanding of how to monitor and manage their learning processes. Attainment of SRL skills has been shown to have a higher correlation with academic success than previous grades or SAT scores. <br/><br/>We expect students to be able to more accurately assess changes in their SRL skills and link these changes to performance based outcome measures including weekly quizzes and major examinations. Because self-regulated learning entails the cyclical use of feedback to plan, implement, and evaluate learning activities, the SRL Performance Assessment System focuses on providing detailed, content-specific feedback to the student within multiple learning opportunities. The project is creating an assessment form designed to help students develop and track the effectiveness of their SRL skills and improve self-evaluative beliefs. Ultimately, this form will be integrated with an EM/SRL Website that will provide each student with a personal profile. <br/><br/>A comprehensive evaluation plan is being implemented throughout the project, including formative and summative elements. The SRL Performance Assessment System's predicted outcomes include: 1) improved academic achievement, 2) higher self-efficacy ratings on quizzes, 3) shifts in attributions for incorrectly solved EM problems from uncontrollable to controllable causes, 4) improved selection and articulation of appropriate academic strategies, 5) more accurate estimates of academic performances, and 6) greater self-satisfaction with academic performance.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Throughout the project, dissemination efforts at the local, regional, and national level have been made. On a local level, the SRL program is working with the Dean and faculty of the School of Technology to incorporate the assessment system into other academic departments. Based on past success with the math and English departments and the anticipated success in electromechanical engineering, we plan to work with colleagues to achieve transfer into other academic departments. On a regional level, the assessment work is being shared at educational research and technology meetings, e.g., the Annual CUNY Technology and the Classroom Conference. On a national level, the findings are being shared at forums such as the annual meetings of the American Education Research Association and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. We are also writing scholarly articles for publication in refereed journals."

Mechanics issues abound across the full scope of advanced and emerging materials. Strong, tough and durable lightweight and high-temperature structural materials are a direct route to energy efficiency. In electronics, the defects that degrade devices are nucleated by high stresses, and the control of stress during device fabrication is a major issue. Yet, stress can drive the formation of useful structures such as quantum dots. There are a host of biological phenomena wherein stress is a primary driving force. Mechanics is thus an integral part of the invention, design and representation of material behavior across the full spectrum of functional systems. Research in the center will emphasize three areas: (i) the mechanics of thin film and small-scale structures, focusing on their formation, stability, and creation of stress during growth, (ii) the mechanics of complex multiphase materials, focusing on the prediction and mechanisms of deformation, fracture and fatigue at micron- and nanometer size scales, and (iii) the mechanics of adhesion in biological systems, focusing on quantifying ranges of material behavior discriminating between normal and abnormal cell function. The Center also has a broad spectrum of educational and outreach programs with the broad goals of exposing young students to the excitement of science; providing teachers with the tools needed to enhance science in their classrooms; exposing undergraduate students to high-level research while providing an environment for minorities and women that presents graduate education as an attractive career path; and enhance new undergraduate engineering programs at partner institutions. The education component of the Center is run by participating MRSEC faculty, and is thus intimately connected to the research efforts and the undergraduate and graduate teaching. The Center involves about twenty Brown faculty predominantly from the Division of Engineering, and also manages a host of central experimental research facilities, such as scanning electron microscope and molecular-beam epitaxy, that are available to the Brown community and industrial users. The Center participants interact with researchers across the world and have collaborative programs with a number of industries, most notably General Motors, in which the unique capabilities developed in fundamental MRSEC research are applied to problems of technological importance."

The propagation of such spikes along neuronal fibers is slow, resulting in noticeable delays. Usually, the existence of delays implies that something is not functioning well or disorganized, just think of traffic delays. However, there is a growing empirical evidence that propagation delays in the brain are maintained with a millisecond precision, that is, they are there on purpose. <br/><br/>The existence of delays is still ignored by the neuroscience community because their significance in neural computations is unclear. In addition, delays complicate modeling because systems with delays are infinite-dimensional from a purely mathematical point of view. <br/><br/>Dr. Izhikevich's experimental and computational studies of biological neurons and networks with delays show that infinite dimensionality is not a nuisance, but an immense advantage that results in an unprecedented, possibly unlimited information capacity of such systems. In particular, the systems can exhibit a novel nonlinear phenomenon -- polychronization -- generation of reproducible time-locked but not synchronous spiking patterns with millisecond precision. The number of such patterns far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, and could be even greater than the number of connections in the network. <br/><br/>Dr. Izhikevich proposes to explore novel computational properties resulted from the infinite dimensionality of spiking networks with delays. In particular, he intends to implement a selectional computation device, which acts according to the principles of Neural Darwinism proposed in 1987 by Nobel Laureate Gerald M. Edelman, who is the director of The Neurosciences Institute. <br/><br/>The major intellectual merit of the proposed research program is that it explores a radically different way of performing computations using spiking neurons, whether artificial or biological. The program advances our understanding of the role of conduction delays in information processing by the brain, and it also suggests a new computation methodology that differs fundamentally from the existing methodologies of artificial neural nets. <br/><br/>The proposed activity strengthens interdisciplinary postdoctoral training program at The Neurosciences Institute -- a small not-for-profit research center focused to understand how the brain works. It reinforces collaboration between theoreticians and experimentalists at the institute interested in understanding the computational power of the brain. The results, including MATLAB and C codes, will be freely available to the public."
