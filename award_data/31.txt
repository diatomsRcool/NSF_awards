0964944	Mineralized tissue research on the life history of Virunga mountain gorillas	BCS	Biological Anthropology	06/15/2010	06/06/2013	Shannon McFarlin	DC	George Washington University	Continuing grant	Rebecca Ferrell	05/31/2016	$354,072.00	Timothy Bromage	mcfarlin@gwu.edu	2121 Eye Street NW	Washington	DC	200522000	2029946255	SBE	1392		$0.00	The major objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of dental and skeletal tissue microanatomy in a known population of African apes from the wild, Virunga mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), Rwanda, with an emphasis on testing relationships between hard tissue development and specific environmental and life history factors.  Using radiographic and histologic techniques, specific aims include : (1) generating primary data on dental and skeletal growth and development in mountain gorillas, establishing an important comparative foundation on great ape development in the wild, and test hypotheses concerning the influence of socioecological factors on variability in great ape life histories; (2) determining the presence and chronology of microanatomical features in hard tissues that record incidence of developmental stress (i.e., accentuated enamel striae; lines of arrested growth in bone); and (3) comparing these chronologies against climatic, behavioral and veterinary records to determine the manner in which environmental factors and characteristics of individual life histories (e.g., weaning, social status, disease, human disturbance) impact the growth of hard tissues and are recorded in their developing microanatomy.  Given availability of associated life records, hard tissue research on Virunga mountain gorillas can contribute significant and unique insight into the biology and health of these critically-endangered great apes, and establish a framework based on the combined study of dental and skeletal tissues in well-documented natural populations that has significant transformative potential for the study of life history evolution from fossils.  <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this project include new international collaborations that foster integration among scientific disciplines; creation of a digital archive of tooth and bone radiographic and microscopy images, available to Rwandan and US students and scientists; and research and training opportunities for US undergraduate and graduate students.  Finally, support for a research assistant and additional training opportunities in Rwanda will build local expertise and capacity to ensure the long-term sustainability of mountain gorilla skeletal preservation and research efforts, and broaden participation of under-represented groups in science.
0956123	CAREER:Language Brokering and Child Adjustment in Mexican American Children	BCS	DS - Developmental Sciences	06/15/2010	03/13/2014	Su Yeong Kim	TX	University of Texas at Austin	Continuing grant	Chalandra Bryant	05/31/2017	$479,962.00		sykim@prc.utexas.edu	3925 W Braker Lane, Ste 3.11072	Austin	TX	787595316	5124716424	SBE	1698	1045, 1187, 1698	$0.00	In this NSF CAREER award, Dr. Kim will examine the academic and socio-emotional development of language brokers (i.e., children who act as translators for their parents), in Mexican immigrant families.  Close to 90% of children in immigrant families perform a language brokering function in their family's resettlement process, taking on the task of translating between the heritage language and English for parents with limited English-speaking skills.  However, scholars have thus far paid little attention to the developmental consequences of being a language broker.  This project on Mexican American families will explore the language brokering experience from multiple perspectives (target child, mother, father).  The goal is to illuminate how language brokering impacts parent-child relationships and, more importantly, how it affects children's adjustment in terms of both academic and socio-emotional outcomes.  Three hundred fifty Mexican American families will be recruited for the project, from schools with a wide range of Latinos in the student population. The study has three research aims: 1) to understand how child language brokering affects parent-child relationships, including any differential effects for mothers and fathers; 2) to investigate how parent-child relationships may be linked to child adjustment in terms of both socio-emotional development and academic outcomes; and 3) to explore how adolescent gender and schools'/neighborhoods' density of Mexican immigrants may influence aims 1 and 2.  This project has the potential to bring to light the effects language brokering may have on the adjustment of the children of Mexican immigrants, the largest and fastest growing minority group in the United States.<br/><br/><br/>This study will examine developmental outcomes for children of Mexican immigrants, a high-risk population with high rates of poverty and low levels of educational attainment. The project aims to understand the mechanisms involved in improving the academic performance of children of immigrants, a growing and significant percentage of America's children, who represent the future of the U.S. workforce.  It also focuses on the developmental period of adolescence, a period of transition in which children are susceptible to developing socio-emotional problems that can compromise school performance.  This research has the potential to identify risk factors that can be used to inform future preventive intervention work with children of immigrants.  Finally, this project will train undergraduate and graduate students who have been traditionally under-represented in the sciences, particularly those of Mexican origin; deliver a curriculum to educate students about the role of immigration, ethnicity, and race in informing child development; and provide workshops, training sessions, and newsletters to educators on the role of language brokering in children's academic functioning.
0969996	Nonlinear Optical Interactions in Rb-Filled Photonic Band-Gap Fibers	PHY	OPTICAL PHYSICS	08/01/2010	07/29/2013	Alexander Gaeta	NY	Cornell University	Continuing grant	John Gillaspy	07/31/2014	$680,000.00		a.gaeta@columbia.edu	373 Pine Tree Road	Ithaca	NY	148502820	6072555014	MPS	1290	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Photonic band-gap fibers (PBGF) are able to guide light via diffraction rather than by total internal reflection.  Such fibers allow for simultaneous high confinement of light and a gas in a hollow-core region.  As a result, PBGF's offer a unique advantage over free-space, focused geometries for interactions of light with gases due to their unmatched ratio of interaction length to cross-sectional core area. The proposed effort involving PBGF's will entail studies in two main areas: 1) ultralow power light-matter interactions with Rb atoms, and 2) the propagation of intense ultrashort laser pulses and high harmonic generation.  For the work with Rb atoms, high density vapors will be produced by the process of light-induced atomic desorption which will allow for exploration of one- and two-photon nonlinear interactions at extremely low light levels.  The effort on high-harmonic generation will explore the possibility of generating light in the deep ultraviolet using femtosecond laser pulses at modest pulse energies by confining both the fundamental and harmonic fields within the core and through use of quasiphasematching techniques. Such a system would have immediate applications in the creation of compact fiber-based ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet sources, which cannot be realized using conventional silica glass fiber.<br/><br/>The graduate students supported by this funding will develop a foundation for understanding a wide range of interactions of light with matter and will acquire the experimental skills necessary for characterizing such interactions. In addition, one or two undergraduates per year will work in the PI's laboratory on projects related to this research effort and gain their first experience of performing research in optical physics.  The PI and the PhD students will participate extensively in outreach activities at Cornell via the NSF-funded Center for Nanoscale Systems Institute for Physics Teachers (CIPT) and the Cornell Center for Materials Research.  In addition, the PI will continue to deliver optics-related seminars to high-school teachers and students.
0944475	Collaborative Research: Pleistocene East Antarctic Ice Sheet History as Recorded in Sediment Provenance and Chronology of High-elevation TAM Moraines	OPP	ANTARCTIC EARTH SCIENCES	06/01/2010	06/08/2010	Michael Kaplan	NY	Columbia University	Standard Grant	Mark Kurz	05/31/2014	$202,885.00	Gisela Winckler	mkaplan@ldeo.columbia.edu	2960 Broadway	NEW YORK	NY	100276902	2128546851	GEO	5112	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Intellectual Merit <br/>The proposed work will investigate changes in the compositional variation of glacial tills over time across two concentric sequences of Pleistocene moraines located adjacent to the heads of East Antarctic outlet glaciers in the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM). The chronologic framework for this work will be generated from cosmogenic exposure ages of boulders on prominent morainal ridges. The PIs hypothesize that variations in till composition may indicate a change in ice flow direction or a change in the composition of the original source area, while ages of the moraines provide a long-term terrestrial perspective on ice sheet dynamics. Both results are vital for modeling experiments that aim to reconstruct the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and assess its role in the global climate system and its potential impact on global sea level rise. The variation of till compositions through time also allows for a more accurate interpretation of sediment cores from the Ross Sea and the Southern Ocean. Additionally, till exposures at the head of some East Antarctic outlet glaciers have been shown to contain subglacial material derived from East Antarctic bedrock, providing a window through the ice to view East Antarctica?s inaccessible bedrock. Till samples will be collected from two well-preserved sequences of moraine crests at Mt. Howe (head of Scott Glacier) and Mt. Achernar (between Beardmore and Nimrod Glaciers). Each size fraction in glacial till provides potentially valuable information, and the PIs will measure the petrography of the clast and sand fractions, quantitative X-ray diffraction on the crushed <2mm fraction, elemental abundance of the silt/clay fraction, and U/Pb of detrital zircons in the sand fraction. Data collection will rely on established methods previously used in this region and the PIs will also explore new methods to assess their efficacy. On the same moraines crests sampled for provenance studies, the PIs will sample for cosmogenic surface exposure analyses to provide a chronologic framework at the sites for provenance changes through time. <br/><br/>Broader Impact <br/>The proposed research involves graduate and undergraduate training in a diverse array of laboratory methods. Students and PIs will be make presentations to community and campus groups, as well as conduct interviews with local news outlets. The proposed work also establishes a new, potentially long-term, collaboration between scientists at IUPUI and LDEO and brings a new PI (Kaplan) into the field of Antarctic Earth Sciences.
1023409	Doctoral Dissertation Research in Political Science:  The Fates of Rebels: The Politics of Insurgency Survival and Demise	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	09/01/2010	06/24/2010	William Reno	IL	Northwestern University	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	08/31/2011	$12,000.00	Christopher Day	reno@northwestern.edu	1801 Maple Ave.	Evanston	IL	602013149	8474913003	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	Political violence that takes place outside of state control, in particular civil wars and insurgencies, raises critical issues for academic inquiry and for practical policy responses to today's international security environment.  Scholarly debates primarily focus on explaining the causes of insurgent violence, with particular reference to those rebellions that succeed or fail.  Seldom examined is the broad range of outcomes faced by the greater majority rebel groups at war's end.  Rebel fates vary considerably along a spectrum from survival, defined as ongoing insurgency or political settlement, to demise, defined as internal fragmentation or external defeat.  These outcomes are not necessarily related to the causes of war, the motivations of group members, or to the degree of popular support for rebellion. <br/> <br/>This dissertation project presents a comparative framework for explaining the organizational variation and corresponding fates experienced by rebel groups in civil wars.  It constructs a new typology of these groups based on two structural factors that contribute to their contrasting fates.  First, a rebel group's degree of autonomy from external state actors' cross-border networks shapes how it collects and uses resources and reflects the role it plays in regional state politics.  Second, its degree of autonomy from internal state authority shapes group membership and reflects the ongoing role it plays in domestic politics.  State strategies for countering rebellion tend to correspond to rebel type and to the ways in which an incumbent regime deals with challenges to its authority from different segments of political society.  These rebel types and their strategic choices provide the basis for generating plausible expectations of their survival or demise. Those with external resource linkages and internal political linkages are more likely to survive than those without.  Such variation is prevalent in the fragmented states and contentious regional politics in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and is present in the borderlands of northern India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. <br/><br/>Fieldwork funded by the NSF award will be conducted in Uganda, Southern Sudan, and Sierra Leone.  It will focus on 1) obtaining and analyzing primary documents to reconstruct patterns of events and to identify key actors; and 2) field interviews with former insurgents, military and government officials, scholars, and civil society leaders, which will lend insight into the internal strategic debates and decision-making of a range of rebel groups that operated in these countries. These cases allow for testable propositions through comparisons while controlling for specific variables, and present counterfactuals against which to test conclusions.<br/><br/>This research is relevant for policymakers in the United States.  Local and regional instability in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, the threat of terrorism, and the recognized connection between failed states and national security focus attention on how to devise effective responses to insurgent violence that has become global in scope.  The study of rebel fates generates widely applicable principles regarding the distinct relationships between rebels and the regimes they fight, and between rebels and neighboring states that sponsor them.  Rebel types derived from these relationships thus lead to predictions regarding their organization, behavior, and ultimate trajectories in warfare.  Research into the inner workings of multiple rebel types shows how international responses, such as peacekeeping interventions and counterinsurgency operations, can influence very different outcomes depending on which type of insurgency is their target.  Such research will therefore provide practical advice on how to address these conflicts.

It is also this variability of materials that adds daunting complexity to image understanding. This research program aims to establish the theoretical and computational foundation for automatic visual understanding and recognition of real-world materials. The program tackles this challenging problem from three key aspects, namely, deriving 1) novel hybrid physically-based and data-driven representations of the spatial, angular, spectral, temporal, and scale variations of material appearance, 2) active and passive methods for estimating the values of physically-based parameters that govern material appearance, and 3) single-image material recognition methods that leverage physically-based optical parameters as priors or invariants to guide machine learning techniques. These research thrusts lead to a comprehensive set of computational tools to recognize materials in real-world images despite their complex appearance variations, such as recognizing rusted metals, discerning soft cloth from hard concrete, identifying different fat content of milks, and labeling image regions with material traits like soft, hard, rough, and heavy.<br/><br/>The capabilities resulting from this program are crucial to a broad range of scenarios, for instance, to enable humanoid robots to understand that it should not squeeze the soft hands of a child, autonomous vehicles to understand what regions to avoid in a rugged terrain, visual analyses of tissues to help medical diagnosis, and automated inspection systems to reliably discover sub-standard quality food to prevent ill-health. The PIs work with research groups in these specific application areas to closely integrate the results from this project into their efforts. The results from this research are also broadly disseminated via publications, websites, databases, new courses and symposiums.

Slaton, PhD<br/>Associate Professor, History, Department of History and Politics, Drexel University<br/><br/>Mary F.E. Ebeling, PhD<br/>Assistant Professor, Sociology, Department of Culture and Communications, Drexel University<br/><br/>As heavy industry and even newer service sector jobs contract in many parts of the United States, regional schemes for economic redevelopment turn toward high-tech areas, including the many scientific and engineering specialties included under the term ?nanotechnology.?  In southeastern Pennsylvania, a partnership among schools, industrial firms, and government agencies has emerged in the last decade to prepare a new workforce for this nanosector.  This study considers the goals and content of certificate and associate?s degree programs among the 22 two- and four-year colleges involved in the Pennsylvania Nanofabrication Manufacturing Technology Partnership (PaNMT). Many PaNMT partners see widening opportunities in nanomanufacturing, in much the same way that enthusiastic planners embraced computing technology in the 1960s and biotech initiatives in the 1990s. Today, proponents forecast nanoindustries as likely to provide both steady corporate expansion and means of economic uplift for disadvantaged citizens. These outlooks have in part been accurate, but in part overly optimistic, as nanomanufacturing grows slowly and continues to employ primarily those with doctorates.  <br/><br/>Combining methodologies of the sociology and history of science, this project examine examine the hiring and bench-level practices in use by PaNMT?s 30 partner firms in nanomanufacturing, positions intended to employ those who undertake associate's-degree training in nanofabrication.  The expectations and experiences of students form a significant focus for the  ethnographic research.  Finally, the study examines the goals and practices of private organizations and local and state governments that have lent support to the PaNMT.  Research questions include:<br/>? How well do educational practices fulfill the workforce needs of regional nano-based industries?  <br/>? To what degree do industrial expectations about technical skill and mobility determine the nature of two-year degrees? <br/>? Are optimal practices, for students or industrial employers, likely to result from these, or from other practices?  <br/>? Do educators, employers, planners, and students see these matters in the same way?  <br/><br/>The outcomes of this study will include a book aimed at social scientists interested in science and technology, and associated articles and presentations on workforce planning and technical education.  This study will  provide suggestions that may lead to more efficacious workforce training policies and practices. Because two-year technical training programs have historically engaged a disproportionate number of economically disadvantaged and minority students, this project should also shed light on longer patterns of occupational equity in high-tech engineering fields.

Bacteria are ideal systems for many microbiorobotic systems, because of the ease of their ?gproduction and refueling?h. For this purpose, microbiorobots (MBRs) are constructed, which consist of flagellated bacteria integrated with fabricated microstructures. The bacterial cells propel the microstructures in fluidic environments.  In this project, some design aspects for the MBRs are explored, including the effects of bacterial density, distribution and orientation on the surface of the MBRs, as well as various modalities to control the bacteria. A number of stimuli, including ultraviolet light, electromagnetic field, chemicals, and thermal stimuli are used as control inputs to the MBRs, while measurement feedback is provided by a computer vision-based system. Deliverables include mathematical models of the system behavior, experimental results on the bacteria morphology, microscopy visualization, prototypical demonstration of motion control, documentation of research results, engineering student education, and engineering research experiences for high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>If successful, the outcome of this research will represent a critical step toward understanding how to control bacterial propulsion systems to manipulate larger engineered elements, for example in microassembly and micromanipulation scenarios. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit from this project through classroom instruction and involvement in the research.  The program will also be integrated with various outreach activities, including (i) microbiorobotics workshops at Drexel and RPI, (ii) active recruitment and training of women and under?]represented minority engineers by leveraging and expanding existing and proven programs already in place at Drexel and RPI, (iii) outreach to high school students and teachers at RPI, and (iv) interactive web?]based tutorials and exhibits.

The workshop will bring together about 100 archaeologists, cultural heritage preservationists, computer vision, visualization, graphics, and new media research and practitioners to discuss the state-of-the art in current research.  The event will also provide a forum for planning and coordination of future efforts. Since the first workshop on Applications of Computer Vision in Archaeology was held in June 2003 the domain of research interest has broadened significantly to include research in graphics and visualization.  At present, nearly all phases of archaeological practice, from discovery in the field, through artifact analysis and conservation, to the presentation of new findings to the public are in a period of radical change.  Computer vision research combined with graphics, visualization and computational methods have made available to archaeology and other interdisciplinary research dealing visual artifacts a rich set of tools and methods to extend research capabilities.   New efforts range from the creation of virtual libraries (digital publishing of field records) to computer-assisted artifact mending technologies to 3D presentations of historical site interpretations.
1041320	Student Support for the Fourth International Brain-Computer Interface Meeting	IIS	Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)	06/01/2010	06/09/2010	Melody Jackson	GA	Georgia Tech Research Corporation	Standard Grant	Ephraim P.

Brain-computer interface research explores avenues of controlling devices directly from brain signals, and the IBCI Meetings constitute the flagship conference for the field.  Effective BCI research requires highly interdisciplinary interactions involving neuroscience, psychology, engineering, mathematics, computer science, and clinical rehabilitation.  Because no standard venue brings these groups together, the IBCI meeting serves a critical catalyst for technology dissemination, new collaborations, and educational opportunities for students.  NSF funding will enable approximately 40 students, including undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, to attend and participate in the conference.  All of the NSF funding will be used for student travel, registration, and student-only event costs.  The organizers' main objective will be to give students a significant educational and professional experience in the BCI field, and to provide opportunities for them to gain depth in their specific interest areas.  The conference will begin with a specialized student colloquium on the afternoon before the full conference starts, which will provide lectures from prominent experts in the BCI field.  This will give the students a solid foundation for understanding the rest of the conference.  There will also be a student poster session and prizes for the best student research projects, and students will have access to research leaders for informal question-and-answer sessions at the end of each day.  The students will participate fully in the main conference as well, mentored by their advisors and other senior conference participants.  This year's conference will have an increased focus on student participation, ensuring a good experience for the students as well as encouraging young researchers to explore the BCI field for their research.  Exposure to prominent researchers in the BCI field will allow students to receive invaluable feedback on their work, and to make connections that may result in new research directions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Student participation in the three previous IBCI meetings has been very fruitful; a large number of those who attended have now graduated and are prominent researchers in the BCI field.  The Journal of Neural Engineering has agreed to publish the Proceedings of this meeting as a series of peer reviewed papers in a special issue, which will further disseminate the results of the meeting.  The organizers are actively working to recruit students from traditionally underrepresented groups to attend the conference.  Supporting student participation in the IBCI conference will educate, motivate, and inspire the future leaders in brain-computer interface research while promoting diversity which will strengthen the BCI research community.

In addition, this study explores the psychological basis for how these students learn about these subjects. Four study/survey groups are being compared: (1) entering biology majors; (2) graduating biology majors; (3) non-biology majors; and (4) expert research biologists, all located at San Francisco State University (SFSU). <br/><br/>The overarching research hypothesis is that entering university biology majors and graduating biology majors hold multiple explanatory frameworks for their understanding of these complex biological phenomena. If this is the case, then biology majors may employ different explanations for a biological phenomenon, like cancer, depending on whether or not they are cued to apply their basic biology knowledge learned in school. A specific aim of this proposal is to investigate what conceptual changes biology majors undergo as a result of their undergraduate training and to what extent do they develop biological expertise during their university education.<br/><br/>This research includes three approaches to gaining insight into biology learning during the proposed five-year funding period: (1) a comparative, cross-sectional survey of a large number (~1800) of university students; (2) more detailed videotaped survey interviews with a subset (~120) of the above-referenced university students; and (3) a longitudinal study over the entire funding period of 20 non-biology majors as compared to 20 biology majors.<br/><br/>This research study is being carried out by Tanner and her graduate students in the SFSU biology department. This represents a unique opportunity for STEM-content-based (biology) graduate students to receive training and experience in science educational research. Furthermore, the PI is developing a new concentration in biology education research as part of the Masters degree in biology. As an urban-serving institution, this project includes a broad representation and diversity of the target undergraduate population. This study is being enhanced by input received from an advisory committee composed of cognitive scientists and science education researchers, as well as through ongoing formative assessment.<br/><br/>The results of this research will inform both the science education and biological content communities. Research findings will be widely disseminated via presentations at national meetings and articles published in peer-reviewed professional journals. It is anticipated that these research results will contribute to understanding how undergraduate students learn complex biological phenomena and lead to insights that could influence how these ideas are taught in higher education throughout the U.S.

These consortia of beneficial microbial symbionts play critical roles in physiological balance, and partner with the host's immune system to foster health. Recognition of these phenomena is revolutionizing how biologists view the function of the normal microbiota of animals and plants. Investigation of host-microbe interactions has been enabled by recent technical advances, making this a critical time to examine research frontiers in this area. The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) has held internationally attended conferences on beneficial microbes in 2005 and 2008 that brought together biologists from a broad range of scientific disciplines.  This year the conference will be held in Miami, Florida. The aim is to provide a forum for discussion and exchange of ideas, and to develop new approaches and a conceptual synthesis. This young field is attracting graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, many of whom will attend this conference. To assure a broad representation, 30% of the organizational committee are women; in addition, 7 of 21 of the invited speakers are junior (pre-tenure), and 8 of the 21 are women. Of the 39 contributed oral presentations, 18 (46%) will be selected for support from submitted abstracts, ensuring ample high-visibility for innovative investigators and ideas.  As in the previous meetings, the selection process for these supported presentations will focus on junior researchers, women and minorities. Students at underrepresented minority institutions will be also targets for support. The proposal budget includes 10 travel awards for minority graduate students with US citizenship, and the awardees will be selected based on the quality of their abstracts.

Continuing the pattern-theoretical approach pioneered by Grenander and advocated by Mumford, and building on the active basis model that the PIs have recently developed, the PIs propose research projects to further develop statistical models as well as associated learning and inference algorithms for vision. The active basis model is a mathematical representation of deformable templates of object patterns. Each template is a sparse composition of selected Gabor wavelet elements that are allowed to perturb their locations and orientations. The template can be learned from training images by a shared sketch algorithm. The learned template can then be used to recognize objects from testing images using a cortex-like architecture of sum-max maps. The proposed research develops hierarchical compositional models with active basis models as building blocks or part-templates. The proposed research studies unsupervised learning of dictionaries of active basis templates from natural images or images of objects from multiple categories and viewpoints. The proposed research also studies a shape script model where the part-templates are designed elementary geometric shapes that are represented by the active basis models. Moreover, the proposed research compares generative and discriminative approaches to learning, using active basis model as an example of generative model. In addition, the proposed research extends the active basis model by coupling wavelet sparse coding for shape patterns and Markov random fields for texture patterns.<br/><br/>Biological visual cortex can learn and recognize huge number of visual patterns in its environment effortlessly. One may consider the visual cortex as an extremely sophisticated statistical model equipped with extremely efficient and robust learning and inference algorithms. What this model looks like and how it learns from its visual environment is still a deep mystery. The proposed research has the potential to contribute to advancing our understanding of this issue. It also leads to concrete models and algorithms that can be used for learning and recognizing a wide variety of object patterns.
1048351	RAPID:Emergency Shoreline Assessment and Sampling of Archaeological Sites Along the Cumberland River in Middle Tennessee	BCS	ARCHAEOLOGY	07/01/2010	06/22/2010	Tanya Peres	TN	Middle Tennessee State University	Standard Grant	John E. Yellen	06/30/2011	$28,933.00	Aaron Deter-Wolf, Shannon Hodge	Tanya.Peres@fsu.edu	1301 E. Main	Murfreesboro	TN	371320001	6154947848	SBE	1391	7914	$0.00	With NSF support, Dr Tanya M. Peres, Mr. Aaron Deter-Wolf, and Dr. Shannon C. Hodge, will conduct an emergency survey and assessment of prehistoric sites along the banks of the Cumberland River in Middle Tennessee. The main goal of this survey is to evaluate damage to archaeological resources as a result of the catastrophic flood and subsequent looting activity, and to recover data from sites which are in the greatest danger of being destroyed. The project will include an examination of all known site locations, recordation of previously unrecorded archaeological deposits, and documentation of both natural and human-made site disturbances. <br/><br/>In May of 2010, heavy rains throughout the Midsouth resulted in severe flooding in Middle Tennessee. In Nashville, the Cumberland River left its banks and impacted or destroyed more than 9,000 homes and businesses while causing more than $1.5 billion in damages. The human tragedy and economic impact of the Middle Tennessee flood have been well publicized and the response to those in need has been widespread. However, little attention has been given to the immediate and ongoing destructive impacts to the archaeological record of the region as a direct result of the May 2010 floods.<br/><br/>The banks of the Cumberland River in Middle Tennessee have been home to human occupation since the late Pleistocene (ca. 10,000 BC). Thousands of years of repeated human occupation resulted in the creation of deeply stratified archaeological deposits along the riverbank. The force of the May 2010 flood caused large sections of Cumberland bankline to erode away. Many of these displaced areas consisted almost entirely of previously intact archaeological deposits. Initial reports suggest that substantial portions of numerous archaeological sites in the Nashville area eroded away entirely during the flood, carrying with them much of the archaeological record of the region. <br/>The flood also revealed previously-unexposed archaeological deposits along the Cumberland riverbank, including substantial shell middens. More than thirty sites in the vicinity of Nashville contain thick layers of freshwater snail and river mussel deposited by prehistoric peoples during the later portion of the Archaic Period (ca. 5000-1000 BC). Shell deposits such as these reduce the natural acidity of soils, resulting in excellent artifact preservation. For this reason, shell midden sites have long been the target of looters intent on obtaining the unique artifacts sometimes included in prehistoric burials. Since the flood, the Tennessee Division of Archaeology has received reports of widespread looting at newly-exposed Cumberland River shell middens, and documented extensive disturbances to human remains contained within shell deposits.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project will be to provide baseline data for the Co-PIs long-term research program and allow us to more specifically target endangered archaeological resources. Ultimately, the Co-PIs will use animal and plant remains, wood charcoal, snails and river mussels, human skeletal remains, and material culture to interpret the prehistoric environment of the Cumberland River in Middle Tennessee; to reconstruct past drought/flooding cycles; look at changes in subsistence economies and technologies; understand why these groups became larger and more sedentary, and how these changes impacted the local resources. The broader impacts of the study also include training of undergraduate students in laboratory techniques and will allow them to increase their knowledge of Tennessee and Southeastern US prehistory.

A central issue being examined is how transfer of learning can be promoted in traditional lecture-based general chemistry settings by integrating carefully crafted classroom activities and homework assignments into the courses. The project has four main goals: 1) to develop and implement such activities and assignments for general chemistry in alignment with research on transfer of learning, 2) to study how the implementation of each of the activities and assignments influences how students engage in key thinking processes, 3) to study relationships between key thinking processes and students' application of general chemistry understanding to new contexts, and 4) to explore how students' beliefs about learning, motivation, and preferred learning strategies impact their engagement in key thinking processes. The project team is adapting the Designs for Knowledge Evolution (DKE) instructional method (developed by Daniel Schwartz's research group) and the Model-Observe-Reflect-Explain (MORE) Thinking Frame instructional method to develop at least twenty DKE-based notice and reconcile activities to be integrated with lectures, eight MORE-based homework assignments that integrate in-class activities and demonstrations with students' development of initial and refined models through reconciliation with evidence, five reflect on your learning processes/strategies assignments, and clicker questions designed to augment and assess learning. The project team is collecting and analyzing data using existing instruments measuring students' attitudes about science, strategies for learning, and conceptual understanding in general chemistry, as well as field observations and video of the implementation of classroom activities, students' written coursework and responses to regular course exams. Analysis of video of student interviews will measure retention of learning through isomorphic questions and transfer of learning through questions that require students to apply their understandings in new contexts. Resources developed by this project will be shared through peer-reviewed publications and through a workshop on how to use the activities and assessments at the 2012 Biennial Conference on Chemical Education. Participants in the workshop will be invited to test the materials, and the project team will provide the materials and support effective implementation.

This research will examine the chemical and physical structure of the reactants and products, as well as the pore structure evolution, involved in the process of late age ettringite formation and subsequent expansion and cracking.  A more thorough understanding of the crystalline pressures induced on the microstructure will result by refining existing models with analytical techniques such as nanoindentation and residual stress analyses.<br/><br/>Concrete is the most widely used engineering material in the world, yet is still poorly understand in many regards. The prevention of delayed ettringite formation, which is known to cause concrete cracking, would significantly improve the infrastructure life span of the United States and abroad.  Educational activities will include traveling to local middle and high schools to provide hands-on experiments that give the students a real-life view of how engineering is an important part of the modern world. Local primary school groups will be invited to campus to participate in hands-on learning experiences at Tennessee Tech?s STEM Center. In addition to the educational activities, a residual stress analysis workshop is proposed at the end of the project to disseminate the strong background in this field at Tennessee Tech to other cement and concrete researchers; thus, expanding beyond traditional K-12 outreach.

1007244	Interactions Among Probability, Group Theory, Graph Theory, and Ergodic Theory	DMS	PROBABILITY	07/01/2010	05/05/2016	Russell Lyons	IN	Indiana University	Continuing grant	Tomek Bartoszynski	06/30/2017	$362,468.00		rdlyons@indiana.edu	509 E 3RD ST	Bloomington	IN	474013654	8128550516	MPS	1263		$0.00	It is proposed to deepen various connections among the mathematical areas of probability, group theory, graph theory, and ergodic theory.  Mainly this will be achieved by probabilistic thinking about questions that arise in other areas.  In group theory, the PI will work on the question of whether every group is sofic.  The PI discovered with Aldous that a probabilistic setting leads to a wider framework for this question and suggests a new approach to it. In graph theory, probabilistic thinking leads to new questions and results involving inequalities for finite graphs.  Namely, one often finds when counting combinatorial objects that a subgraph contains fewer of them than the whole graph. But if the subgraph is based on fewer vertices, then one ought to normalize the counts to reflect this.  The PI has some partial results in this direction and proposes to find more.  In ergodic theory, questions involve graphings, colorings, and factors. In fact, it may be that these investigations will lead to progress in the theory of percolation on groups.  Combining several of these areas are very natural processes that are related (by previous work of the PI) to algebraic invariants known as ell-2-Betti numbers.  Therefore, they suggest ways of resolving an important open question about these Betti numbers.<br/><br/><br/>In the 19th century, Cayley introduced graphs (networks) to represent the algebraic objects known as groups.  It is always desirable to have finite approximations to infinite objects, and the same holds for infinite groups.<br/>Gromov and Weiss suggested a way to use finite networks for this purpose.<br/>If one can actually succeed in making such approximations for all groups, then this would resolve a host of important conjectures in a variety of fields of mathematics.  The PI proposes to continue work on this question.<br/>Inequalities are important in most areas of mathematics. The field of graph theory and combinatorics contains many inequalities, often of the form that certain graphs contain the most (or the fewest) possible objects of a certain type among all graphs in a given class. The PI will develop novel inequalities of this type, which are inspired by a probabilistic viewpoint.<br/>Topology is the study of the shape of things. One tool is to count the number of holes of various dimensions. But if the whole space of interest is infinite, then the number of holes is often either zero or infinity. It turns out that there is a more informative way to count holes, and previous work of the PI has shown how it is related to random combinatorial objects.<br/>Therefore, the PI will attempt to use his new random objects to resolve an important open question about this hole counting.

Our lack of understanding of the micro-scale processes/mechanisms of interactions between soil minerals and SON compounds hinders our ability to predict N flux between different soil compartments at the ecosystem-scale. To address this issue, an interdisciplinary approach that combines a broad array of novel molecular, biological, and synchrotron-based spectroscopic techniques is proposed to investigate the interaction mechanisms between soil minerals and amino acids and small peptides, two key components of soil SON. Novel methods will be used to achieve the research. The phage display technique will be used to screen, in a short period of time, billions of random small peptide sequences for those peptides displaying a selective affinity for a particular mineral surface. Macro-scale adsorption isotherms for amino acids and small peptides on four minerals commonly found in soil will be obtained. Using the samples collected from the adsorption isotherms experiment, polarization-dependent N (1s) near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) will be used to investigate, at micro-scale, the average molecular surface orientation. Lastly, a microbial essay method will be used to understand at micro-scale how molecular surface organization on mineral surfaces affects the microbial utilization of adsorbed amino acids and small peptides.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The PIs are cooperating with two local high schools (The Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science and The West Oktibbeha County High School) to recruit future minority undergraduate students for summer research projects. Those summer research projects will provide minority high school students opportunities to gain hands?]on experience in biogeochemistry research and state of the art instrumentations, to obtain insight into the nature of both undergraduate and graduate school, to work with university professors and graduate students as an interdisciplinary team, and to have informed choices about how to advance their future career. The students will also be given the opportunity to attend regional or national meetings and to visit national laboratories. The work from these students and the research of this proposal will be showcased at their high schools and highlighted in state competitions such as the Engineering Fair and the Young Scientist Division at the Mississippi Academy of Science.

Experimental tests of N vs. phosphorus (P) limitation in temperate forest systems are lacking.  This study will combine modeling and field studies to explore nutrient limitation in relation to successional change in managed forest ecosystems.  An improved understanding of ecosystem optimization of resource use is important to forest management, environmental protection, and basic scientific knowledge. Balanced nutrient cycling is essential to maintaining forest sustainability, and scientists and managers at the White Mountain National Forest will evaluate silvicultural practices in light of results from the proposed research.  For example, their forest management plans require justifying intensive harvest removals in terms of the ability of forests to acquire nutrients for regrowth.  Feedbacks such as the biological enhancement of mineral weathering when nutrients are limiting are clearly relevant to this appraisal.<br/>The Multi-Element Limitation (MEL) model includes P as well as N, carbon, light, and water, and is being applied to simulate succession in northern hardwood forests. Using nutrient additions of N alone in some forest stands, P alone in some forest stands, N+P in some forest stands,  in replicated stands of three ages (~20, 30, and > 100 years) at the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, the investigators will test the patterns of resource limitation.  The model predicts a greater response of aboveground productivity to N+P than N or P alone. In older stands, it predicts a greater response to N than to P addition, but in younger stands, the model suggests that the supply of N from detritus should be sufficient to create P limitation.

This research is the first to investigate changes in the nitrogen cycle across the extinction event.  The PI applies a previously established a relationship between nitrogen isotopes and the oxidation state of the environment based on the predominant nitrogen reactions and their associated isotopic fractionation. They will measure the bulk, kerogen, and porphyrin d15N values across the K-Pg boundary for several cores to determine nitrogen cycling and paleoredox reactions before, during, and after the mass extinction event. The PI will test the hypothesis that the oxygen concentration in the deep waters decreased following the impact event, and that cores located in different ocean basins will record different d15N profiles as dictated by the deep water redox state at each location. The results will provide important information about the processes of global mass extinction and the subsequent recovery of biogeochemical systems. Funding supports a new female PI and a graduate student. Further broader impacts include collaboration with the COSEE-NOW (Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence Networked Ocean World) to develop educational products aimed at improving ocean literacy. Funding support is provided by the Marine Geology and Geophysics Program of NSF's Ocean Science Division and by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

To do this, first bacteria will be collected from kitchens, bathrooms, yards, people and pets, and other places within human homes.  This collection of Pseudomonas will be studied genetically, to identify places in the home that tend to share related bacteria.  When bacteria in two locations are closely related it suggests that the locations were colonized by the same parent source. Second, many types of bacteria coexist in bacterial communities. The ways in which the focal bacteria, Pseudomonas, interact with other members of the bacterial community will also be quantified.  This information will shed light on the degree to which locations that look similar to the human eye are actually also similar from the perspective of the microbes' ability to persist and provide insights into microbial differentiation.  Third, physical characteristics of Pseudomonas that affect the bacteria's interactions with the physical environment and with other members of the bacterial community will be measured.  This will aid in the development of an understanding of how Pseudomonas can live where it does, and how it affects other members of the bacterial community, helping to define the niche of this bacteria. Finally, sterile environments such as clean drains and new houseplant soil will be introduced into human homes and the arrival and establishment of Pseudomonas bacteria in them will be described.  These experiments will allow us to document the process by which Pseudomonas move among locations in the human home.<br/><br/>In addition to the direct scientific results of this work, the project will generate additional contributions.  One of these will be a large collection of Pseudomonas isolates that will be available to researchers for future work.  In addition, the project will be used to train university students, and the research group will collaborate with local high school teachers and students, including underrepresented groups, to bring the study of bacteria into the curriculum of an AP high school biology class in the Louisville KY area.
0961900	Collaborative Research:  Determining rates of group-specific phytoplankton and bacterial  uptake of inorganic and organic nitrogen by means of stable isotope techniques	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY, EPSCoR Co-Funding	06/15/2010	05/21/2012	Boris Wawrik	OK	University of Oklahoma Norman Campus	Standard Grant	David L.

Considerable progress has been made in defining N cycling processes in marine environments in recent years, but significant questions remain unanswered in part due to methodological limitations. Traditional tools for studying N cycling, for example, cannot accurately assess phytoplankton or bacteria specific N use in marine ecosystems. Therefore there is a need to develop new techniques and methodologies. The PIs of this project have recently made two important advances in this context: (1) a flowcytometric methodology (FCM) to separate phytoplankton from bacteria was applied to separately measure N uptake by these two groups. Prior methodologies relied on measurements of different size fractions, which always contain some degree of both phytoplankton and bacterial uptake. FCM allows for the distinct separation of bacterial versus phytoplankton N incorporation. (2) N-based DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) methodology has been adapted to interrogate N uptake in specific phytoplankton populations. DNA SIP can provide evidence for the uptake of an N source into a specific population of phytoplankton or bacteria. This methodology is in contrast to traditional measurements, which cannot make inferences about individual populations or species. <br/><br/>This project aims to apply these two methodological advances in order to obtain the next generation of N uptake measurements. Phytoplankton and bacteria specific uptake rates will be measured via the FCM technique, and the individual groups or species of phytoplankton or bacteria will be interrogated for N uptake via DNA SIP. These tools will be applied across the well-characterized nutrient gradient found in Chesapeake Bay during one summer cruise and one winter cruise. Phytoplankton, bacterial, and archaeal populations will be characterized along the sampling transect via multiplexed pyrosequencing technology. N uptake will be measured for inorganic (NH4+, NO3-, and NO2-) and organic N sources (15N and 14C urea dual-labeled and amino acids) as substrates. The investigators hypothesize that phytoplankton will derive a larger percentage of their N nutrition from organic forms along the transect (i.e. North to South), as competition with bacteria for ammonium increases. DNA SIP will be applied to specific dominant phytoplankton and bacterial populations in order to investigate their N nutrition. By applying this unique combination of methodologies, the project will provide unprecedented community, group and species level resolution of N uptake in Chesapeake Bay and will furnish us with an improved understanding of N cycling in the Bay and marine systems as a whole.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will be integrated into the education of students at the high-school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. Several graduate students will be directly involved in conducting the proposed research, and the PIs will provide undergraduate directed research opportunities for talented and motivated students seeking research experience. Students will be trained in several research areas including: molecular biology, microbial ecology, ecosystems biology, as well as environmental and analytical chemistry. Additionally, the PIs will extend K-12 educational outreach to the community through engaging six Oklahoma high school teachers in summer research projects, followed by interactive videoconferencing via a mobile platform to provide virtual interactive field trips to K-12 teachers in Oklahoma schools. This will be achieved through collaboration with the K-20 Center for Education and Community Renewal at the University of Oklahoma. K-20 is an interdisciplinary, statewide center focusing on educational and community renewal in Oklahoma through interactive, action-oriented partnerships among schools, universities, industry, community and governmental agencies.

Box 6845	Morgantown	WV	265066845	3042933998	ENG	1517, 9150	101E, 107E, 7237, 9150	$0.00	The project will address the mechanisms of spin transfer-induced magnetization oscillations in nanodevices based on magnetic point contacts, and explore the methods to control their characteristics.  In order to improve the variability among the devices and reduce the generation linewidth for practical applications, it is important to understand the spatial properties of magnetization dynamics and their relationship with the device geometry and physical conditions.  To accomplish these goals, a combination of electronic spectroscopy and two imaging techniques, Brillouin light scattering microscopy and x-ray dichroism microscopy, will be employed for characterization of spatial and spectral properties of oscillators.  To understand the role of device structure, two new magnetic geometries will be explored that will enable independent control of the configurations of the magnetic layers in the devices.  Nanomagnetic oscillators with improved oscillation characteristics will be designed by employing magnetic confinement effects as well as dynamical feedback.  Two types of feedback will be implemented including a resonant circuit and an electromagnetically coupled active external feedback.  The latter will be implemented through phase locking to second harmonic, also known as parametric pumping, or other higher order phase locking effects.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit.  The main outcome of the project will be comprehensive measurement of the magnetization dynamics induced by spin transfer, which will lead to an improved fundamental understanding of the effects of spin transfer and magnetization dynamics in nanoscale systems.  The information obtained from the proposed measurements will be used to develop new methods to control and modify magnetic dynamics in nanostructures.  The project will contribute to development of magnetic microscopy and spectroscopy techniques, as well as time-resolved microscopic measurements.  The main transformative aspect of the project will be a qualitatively new level of understanding of current-induced dynamical properties of magnetic nanodevices achieved by using new measurement techniques, as well as development of novel active magnetic devices.<br/><br/>Broader impacts. The project will contribute to the development of new nanoscale magnetic measurement techniques involving spectroscopy and time-resolved microscopy.  In addition to practical applications in microwave technology, the project will invigorate the broader research area of science and engineering of nanomagnetic devices, with additional benefits for design and implementation of magnetic memory and logic devices that share the fundamental properties with magnetic nano-oscillators.<br/><br/>The project will contribute to professional development of the students involved in its implementation, other students in the PI's group via group-level interactions, as well as a much larger group of students and researchers that will be involved in the measurements at the collaborating institution and the national facility, and those attending conferences and seminars where the results of the research will be presented. The impact on the professional development of undergraduate students will be enhanced by the continued commitment of the PI to undergraduate student research, and active involvement in several undergraduate summer research programs.  A female and/or a minority student will be specifically targeted for the participation in the project.

The complexity is such that our judgments in this area are prone to errors, leading to decisions that we may later stand to regret. These errors stem from lack of information or computational ability; but also from problems of self-control and limited self-insight. Our research focuses on designing and testing systems that anticipate and counter cognitive and behavioral biases that hamper users' privacy (as well as security) decision making. Our approach is informed by the growing body of behavioral economics research on ?soft,? or asymmetric, paternalism, as well as by research in behavioral decision research and usability. Inspired by these streams of research, we design and study systems that ``nudge'' users towards certain privacy or security behaviors ? which the users themselves have stated to prefer, or which empirical evidence has demonstrated to be beneficial. Helping users avoid mistakes, decrease regret, and achieve more rapidly the desired balance between sharing and protecting personal information has clear, and significant, societal importance. However, our research will also inform the work of privacy (and security) technologists and policy makers by advancing our understanding of what makes privacy decision making difficult, and how to counter biases that adversely affect privacy- and security-sensitive behavior.

Stark	08/31/2012	$94,573.00		paupert@asu.edu	75 S 2000 E	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	841128930	8015816903	MPS	1267, 9150	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	The proposed research is a systematic investigation of (real and complex) reflection groups in PU(n,1). The main goal is to obtain new discrete subgroups and lattices in PU(2,1), more specifically many new non-arithmetic lattices. Hyperbolic reflection groups are an important class of groups in the realm of discrete subgroups and lattices in Lie groups, and more generally in geometry and topology. Such groups are accessible to a direct geometric description and understanding which are not always clear for groups defined algebraically or arithmetically. While these reflection groups are relatively well understood in the constant curvature setting (they are then Coxeter groups in Euclidean, spherical or real hyperbolic n-space), very little is known about their complex hyperbolic counterparts.<br/><br/>A tessellation or crystal structure is a way of filling space with non-overlapping tiles in a pattern that repeats infinitely often. A lattice is the symmetry group of a tessellation. Understanding these crystallographic structures in Euclidean 3-space is crucial in Chemistry. <br/>The PI studies the analogous structures in hyperbolic spaces. Real and complex hyperbolic spaces are spaces of negative curvature modelled on the real or complex numbers. Negative curvature means loosely that non-intersecting straight lines tend to diverge from each other in both directions. Real hyperbolic spaces of dimensions 2 and 3 appear in special relativity, in Lorentz and Minkowski space-time; understanding these spaces and their symmetry groups is important in theoretical Physics. Finally, the PI will continue his various outreach activities involving undergraduates and K-12 students.

This organization was established in 1992 to promote and coordinate marine scientific research in order to advance knowledge of living marine resources, land-ocean and atmosphere-ocean interactions, ecosystem components and processes, resource usage, ocean response to global weather and climate change, and human impacts in the North Pacific. Members presently include Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and the United States. Participation by U.S. scientists in Annual Meetings, scientific committee working groups and workshops, will also be funded through this award.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The availability of travel funds not only provides influence on the scientific planning for large scale international collaborations, but also provides the opportunity to entrain colleagues and graduate students into research collaborations, scientific sessions, and workshops. The scale of the North Pacific Ocean demands broad collaboration, and the intellectual merits of international collaboration leads to increased understanding of how diverse scientists address their research. Entrainment of young scientists from both the US and foreign countries into these collaborations represents one of the capacity building strategies of PICES, and one which has a broader impact on US science through appreciation of the diverse multicultural approaches to science. Funds have been add sufficient funds to this project to provide full travel support for young (<35 yr of age) academic scientists to the PICES annual meeting. With matching funds from PICES this will allow participation by 3 young academic scientists annually.

Results of this research may revolutionize recycling practices of asphalt shingles in pavement construction by validating a new approach to incorporate discarded asphalt shingles into asphalt pavement construction.  Current practices of dry blending Recycled Asphalt Shingles (RAS) with the aggregates before the asphalt binder is added to the batch are often criticized due to the large variability observed in the asphalt content of asphalt shingles.  The proposed wet process may offer the potential to increase the percentage of asphalt shingles used in the mixture and may allow for a better control of the chemical and physical reactions taking place in the blend.<br/><br/>The proposed approach has the potential to cope with the increase in construction waste while reducing the consumption of petroleum products in asphalt construction and increase resource efficiency.  Educational activities will seek to promote the understanding of sustainability concepts among undergraduate and high school students and to engage students from underrepresented groups into laboratory activities by offering two summer internships for a student from Southern University, a historically black institution, and for one female engineering student from LSU.  Proposed educational activities will also establish a partnership between LSU, the flagship institution for the state, and Southern University and high schools predominantly serving underrepresented groups.

Admin.	Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	MPS	1267		$0.00	This proposal addresses central problems in low dimensional topology and geometry. The PI plans to investigate the topology of ending laminations space as well as problems related to Dehn surgery on links and taut foliations.  In addition to study the topology of low volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds as well as those which are ultra large.  The latter have large volume, Cheeger constant bounded below and have strongly irreducible minimal genus Heegaard splittings.  The PI also plans to study smooth Schoenflies 4-balls. <br/><br/><br/>Three-manifold topology is the study of objects that locally look like the standard three-dimensional space in which we live.  Two-manifold topology is the study of surfaces such as the sphere, torus and the surface of higher genus.  While objects such as surfaces and standard 3-space are very simple, the class of objects that exist in them is incredibly rich and fascinating.  For example, there is knot theory in 3-space and the theory of curves and laminations in surfaces.  These theories in turn are fundamentally connected with many other mathematical structures such as non Euclidean geometry.  This proposal addresses basic mathematical questions in these areas.  A classical fundamental theorem in topology is that any smooth closed curve in the plane, such as the circle, bounds a smooth disc.  In fact such a theorem is true in dimension three and unknown in dimension four.  The PI plans to investigate this very mysterious question at the heart of smooth 4-dimensional topology.

This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project seeks to train such professionals through directed undergraduate research conducted in neo-tropical Ecuador, in a cooperative initiative between the University of Idaho (UI) and the Universidad TÈcnica Particular de Loja (UTPL). Participating students from Idaho will work in small, vertically integrated, interdisciplinary teams (2-3 students) within the Andean Region of southern Ecuador, addressing individual research questions focused around an umbrella theme of biodiversity conservation and sustainable community development.  Specific projects include the conservation genetics of endangered Andean species, biodiversity assessment and restoration of endangered orchids, international protected areas management and policy, and invertebrate taxa as bioindicators in regional watersheds.  UI graduate students will serve as team leaders, while UTPL faculty and staff, coordinated by research vice-rector Dr. Juan Pablo Su·rez, will serve as project leads. <br/><br/>Southern Ecuador is noteworthy for its geographic, ecological, and cultural richness, and yet baseline knowledge is lacking for much of the country's natural heritage. This project's multinational research team encompasses expertise in landscape and organismal ecology, conservation biology, molecular systematics, landscape genetics, watershed management, environmental sociology, policy, sustainable community development, and education. Through targeted application of this expertise, the project will contribute to strategic conservation planning in the United States and other countries.   Participating U.S. students will also gain experience with a rich array of cultures, thus building a sophisticated, externalized perspective on science and collaboration.

In predicting sediment transport, the interacting role between surface water and shallow ground water is not well understood. The importance of ground water seepage and piping is unknown with respect to other fundamental processes of river erosion, although seepage and piping features are observed on streambanks throughout the world that span a range of geomorphologic conditions. Specific seepage and piping mechanisms that cause bank failure may never manifest themselves as transparent features on unstable banks.<br/><br/>This research hypothesizes that multiple ground water flow mechanisms, combined with fluvial processes, affect the occurrence and timing of streambank erosion and failure. Ground water forces can act over extended periods to destabilize banks between flow events. Specific seepage mechanisms become prevalent under certain predictable streambank stratigraphy and hydrologic conditions. This research is currently conducting three-dimensional soil column experiments to accomplish the following objectives: (1) determine the occurrence and prevalence of different seepage erosion mechanisms (i.e., seepage gradient forces and undercutting); (2) derive a sediment transport equation for seepage erosion across a range of soil textures and cohesions; (3) identify typical undercut formations when seepage undercutting occurs; and (4) determine the sequence of erosion steps leading to failure by ground water flow through soil pipes.  Laboratory experiments combining three-dimensional soil columns and small-scale, recirculating, indoor flumes are quantifying the impact of seepage on a bank?s resistance to fluvial erosion and determining the role of vegetation in preventing bank weakening by subsurface/fluvial processes. The hypotheses affirmed/falsified by the laboratory experiments are being examined at the field scale through innovative field experiments. Two field sites in Oklahoma are being instrumented to monitor natural fluvial shear stresses, pore-water pressures, and gradient forces over several months prior to a controlled seepage induced failure experiment. <br/><br/>This research has implications for understanding and implementing successful riparian management programs and erosion mitigation policies in the United States and abroad. Issues such as streambank stability and sediment load to streams have been major concerns for decades and billions of dollars have been spent on streambank protection and restoration. This sediment loading must be addressed through riparian management.  However, the range of possible solutions remains limited until we better understand the surface/ground water interactions. This project aims to strengthen student research and mentoring skills as well as build faculty and student experience, publications, and networks in the United States and abroad. A primary strength of this proposal is the continuation of established partnerships between an academic institution (Oklahoma State University) and a federal government agency (USDA-ARS National Sedimentation Laboratory). This research is being disseminated to high school students across Oklahoma, including typically underrepresented students in engineering (i.e., rural, women, and Native American students), through a unique soil erosion contest associated with the Future Farmers of America (FFA) Career Development Events.<br/>

Equally crucial to society is an informed public that is able to respond to the societal challenges of climate change with sound scientific knowledge. This project is an integrated research and teaching program that will enhance understanding of the controls over the storage of carbon in dryland soils, and implement educational initiatives to enhance ecological and climate literacy in rural southern New Mexico.  Drylands are extremely important in the global carbon cycle: they account for a large proportion of global land area, and widespread changes in land cover and disturbances in these areas may strongly affect soil carbon pools.  Soil carbon dynamics are particularly poorly understood in drylands, where controls may be distinctly different from those in better-studied, less dry systems due to differences in plant inputs, vegetation cover, disturbance regimes, and climate.  A suite of new analytical techniques will be used to assess the sources and stability of soil carbon pools in drylands. These techniques will be used to address three questions: 1) How do changes in above- and belowground plant inputs affect dryland soil carbon content and stability?  2) How do differences in historical land management and vegetation affect soil carbon?  3) How do soil disturbances and vegetation change caused by desert rodents affect soil carbon content and stability?  Together, these studies will provide important information about current and future soil carbon dynamics and their feedback to the climate system.  <br/><br/>Educational outreach is a central focus of this project.  Early exposure to scientific ideas in children is vital for stimulating interest in science and laying the foundation for scientific literacy.  As such, educational initiatives in this project will focus on enhancing ecological and climate literacy in elementary-level students and teachers.  An inquiry based elementary curriculum focused on desert ecology and climate change will be developed, field-tested, and disseminated.  To further enhance elementary education, courses will be developed for teachers on the use of innovative technological tools to engage students in ecosystem science. Elementary curriculum development and field testing will provide support to an after-school program in a high-poverty school district with high minority enrollment. Climate change literacy in the local community will be enhanced through curriculum dissemination and teacher education courses and workshops.

Professor Lai's work will address the question of how ligand-induced folding in peptides can be utilized in the design of folding-based electrochemical biosensors. A proof-of-concept study will focus on the detection of anti-HIV antibodies using peptide epitopes from HIV-related antigens. The sensor constructs to be investigated include both stem-loop and linear designs.  In both sensor constructs, the distal end of the peptide is attached to an electrochemically active reporter, whereas the proximal end is selectively immobilized to an electrode surface. The analyte-induced change in the location of electrochemically active reporter will then determine the current observed in the system. <br/><br/>The proposed study has the potential to impact the field of biosensor development and facilitate the use of peptides as recognition components in a wide range of chemical and biological applications. Integrating concepts of electrochemistry and molecular biology, the project will provide training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. To support this training, an undergraduate course in general electrochemistry and a graduate course in advanced biosensing techniques will be developed. Professor Lai will also host an annual summer workshop on biosensor technology for Nebraska high school teachers, with the goal of preparing them with the knowledge of easy-to-demonstrate experiments for high school classes to spur students' interests in chemistry and biosensor technology.

Experimental tests of N vs. phosphorus (P) limitation in temperate forest systems are lacking.  This study will combine modeling and field studies to explore processes mediating nutrient colimitation in relation to successional change in managed hardwood forest ecosystems.  An improved understanding of ecosystem optimization of resource use, including the maintenance of co-limitation, is important to forest management, environmental protection, and basic scientific knowledge. Balanced nutrient cycling is essential to maintaining forest sustainability, and scientists and managers at the White Mountain National Forest will evaluate silvicultural practices in light of results from the proposed research.  For example, their forest management plans require justifying intensive harvest removals in terms of the ability of forests to acquire nutrients for regrowth.  Feedbacks such as the biological enhancement of mineral weathering when nutrients are limiting are clearly relevant to this appraisal.<br/>The Multi-Element Limitation (MEL) model represents co-limitation from the perspective of resource optimization theory and ecosystem biogeochemistry. We have extended the model to include P as well as N, carbon, light, and water, and applied it to simulate primary and secondary succession in northern hardwood forests. Using nutrient additions of N alone in some forest stands, P alone in some forest stands, N+P in some forest stands,  in replicated stands of three ages (~20, 30, and > 100 years) at the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, we will test the patterns of resource limitation predicted by the model and multiple mechanisms of allocation of effort to acquire N and P.  Specifically, the model predicts a greater response of aboveground productivity to N+P than N or P alone. In older stands, it predicts a greater response to N than to P addition, but in younger stands, the model suggests that the supply of N from detritus should be sufficient to create P limitation.

The experimental program's goal is to learn about and image the composition of protons and neutrons - generically called nucleons - which comprise nearly all  the currently visible matter in the universe. Nucleons are composed of very complicated arrays of quarks immersed in the  strong nuclear fields called gluons.<br/> <br/> The main instrument used is the CLAS spectrometer,  inside of which a beam of electrons from the Jefferson Lab accelerator impinges upon a target of protons. Most often the target is in the form of liquid hydrogen atoms.  The experiments in which the RPI group are focusing are those in which an electron in the beam strikes and scatters off a proton  and part of the energy imparted to the proton produces either a single photon (a quantum of electromagnetic radiation), or a single meson, which is a particle consisting of a quark and antimatter quark pair. By studying this reaction as the  imparted energy and  direction of the scattered electron is varied, the group  seeks to obtain a three dimensional image of the  distributions of the quarks in the proton, which has never yet been accomplished.<br/><br/> During this grant period the group will continue work on a new CLAS spectrometer, called CLAS12, which is part of the ongoing project at Jefferson Lab to double the energy of the electron beam. The component of the CLAS12 spectrometer on which the RPI is specifically contributing is called a high threshold Cherenkov counter (HTCC), which will be used to identify the scattered electrons. This is in addition to the more general role the Principal Investigator  plays in the upgrade as chairman of the CLAS12 steering committee.<br/><br/> RPI is a technology based  university whose primary goal is to prepare future scientists and engineers for the most advanced technological demands of society.  The complexity of the experiments in this research require the development and use of  the most  advanced scientific equipment and computational techniques.  RPI graduate and undergraduate students, as well as post-doctoral associates, participate one way or another in programs such as this, and in the present case directly carry out most of the direct work on the experimental program, enabling them to become the scientific and engineering leaders of a technologically competitive society.

The award supports work by Professor Ekaterina Pletneva at Dartmouth College to probe and then rationally modulate mechanisms of conformational switching in signaling proteins. The studies will determine how redox chemistry and ligand binding combine with the protein folding dynamics to afford function. Kinetic measurements of gated electron transfer and fluorescence resonance energy transfer will serve as analytical tools to quantitatively characterize structural changes in proteins and thus experimentally map energy landscapes of protein folding and function. Teaching efforts will bring elements of modern research into upper-level and introductory chemistry courses including opportunities for undergraduates to influence science through critical writing. Professor Pletneva and her students work on the Women in Science project at Dartmouth and reach out to local science teachers and their students, establishing connections with a young generation of prospective scientists. These studies advance understanding of many biological systems where conformational changes govern function and provide valuable insights for the design of protein-based switchable devices for use in electronic nanocircuits and artificial photosynthesis. Rational manipulation of protein folding and switchable behavior will be an important step toward these engineering applications.

Gillan of the Chemistry Department at the University of Iowa seeks support for research related to a recently discovered energetically favorable oxygen-free method to produce nanocrystalline phosphorus-rich metal phosphides (e.g., NiP2). This new method uses much lower temperatures and greater macrostructural flexibility than has previously been demonstrated in phosphide synthesis. The proposed research studies will manipulate experimental conditions, particularly with respect to Lewis base coordinating additives in solvothermal reactions, to develop rational and flexible synthetic methodologies for nanoparticle metal phosphide growth. Advances in understanding the molecular basis of precursor reactivity are critical to the tuning and control of composition, structure, and morphology of resulting metal phosphides, sulfides, and mixed anion/cation structures. Improved molecular synthetic understanding will lead to more sophisticated chemical syntheses of phosphide (and sulfide) materials with structural complexity and physical properties that are not accessible by current synthetic methodologies.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Gillan will perform research where the specific chemical reactivity investigated will encompass catalysis related to photochemical hydrogen evolution from aqueous and alcohol media and thermal catalytic removal of sulfur from organic molecules. Both catalytic processes have potential impacts in energy-relevant areas, particularly in hydrogen implementation in fuel cell technology and in sulfur removal from hydrocarbon fuels. Broader impacts also include training key research personnel to work on multifaceted research at the interface of molecular and materials chemistry and to provide the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students with the critical tools necessary for future success outside the academic laboratory. Specifically, they will be taught how to design and implement appropriate research safety protocols in the laboratory environment, to foster beneficial collaborative interactions with other researchers in allied fields, and to effectively mentor junior colleagues in design of research strategies. In addition to improvements in the teaching of materials chemistry to undergraduates, Professor Gillan has established new partnerships with the University of Iowa's Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Institute to aid in educating K-12 teachers and the community about real world applications of useful chemical reactions and inorganic and organic materials.

The roles of DMSP and DMSO within the organisms that produce them, as well as their intracellular concentrations, are poorly understood. DMSO has been speculated to play a role in intracellular osmoregulation, cryoprotection and scavenging of reactive oxygen species, but its intracellular concentration in plankton has only been inferred. Quantitative measurement of the concentration of biogenic sulfur compounds in vivo is necessary to more completely understand their biogeochemistry.  The principal investigator has developed methods for the quantitative analysis of biogenic sulfur compounds using Raman spectroscopy, which have resulted in the detection of DMSO with a sensitivity of <10 mM - far lower than the current estimates of its intracellular concentrations. The research will extend this technique to DMSP. The direct determination of the intracellular DMSP and DMSO, will allow the proposed roles of these compounds in phytoplankton to be investigated. Lastly, using field-collected cores, measurements will be made of the intracellular sulfur compounds as well as the concentration of molecular anions in the sea ice micro-environment. As an RUI project, successful completion of this work will have a substantial impact on undergraduate education in the Chemistry Department at the University of South Alabama, exposing undergraduates and, particularly, under-represented minorities in the sciences to cutting-edge research. It will provide financial support for their education and allow them to present research in journal articles and at technical meetings. Contacts with scientists in the field of Antarctic research at other institutions will give students the opportunity to interact with researchers in related fields, broadening their experience base.

This may be attributed to the near infinite complexities of natural systems, our inability to measure necessary variables adequately in space and time, and difficulties in quantifying non-linear watershed processes and threshold mediated runoff generation. We acknowledge the advances to date in catchment process understanding and modeling and are engaged in activities focused on both expanding the limits of our system behavior understanding and developing hybrid conceptual (mathematical) models internally validated and tested with synthesized process observations. We are conducting a suite of empirical and modeling studies performed iteratively at the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest (TCEF) in the Little Belt Mountains of central Montana, across seven adjacent diverse watersheds and more than five years of variable climatic forcings. <br/><br/>We specifically address the following challenges in catchment hydrology:<br/><br/>1) What is the role of landscape structure (shape) in headwater mountain catchment hydrologic response and source water contributions? Follow-on: Does the relative importance of structure change across variable forcing (climatic variability)?<br/>2) Can we develop new quantifications (models) of watershed behavior based on hypotheses about the role of landscape structure in watershed response? Follow-on: How do field observations help infer specific model structures and parameters, and constrain predictive uncertainty?<br/>3) Does the effectiveness of catchment models based on landscape structure vary across multiple watersheds or under different climatic forcing? Follow-on: How do we compare the transferability of new model conceptualizations to traditional models based on topographic controls, variable source area concepts, or simple water balance representations?<br/><br/>To address these challenges we are working to build tools and infrastructure for research and education. We focus on themes critical to watershed science to improve transferability of watershed understanding and predictability of watershed response via new process conceptualizations and model structures.

The investigators are designing several interventions that will enhance the students' interest and self-efficacy, two key factors that have been shown to be strongly predictive of academic choice goals in engineering and non-engineering students.  The components of the program include a first-year summer experience, peer mentoring for first-year students and new transfers, living and learning communities, a transfer student seminar, and research fellowships. Each component of the program provides critical support at key junctures in the students' academic careers and provides reinforcing experiences so that the students can begin to see themselves in an engineering career. These components are designed to: (1) facilitate the first-year students' and new transfer students' transition into the school of engineering; (2) increase students' commitment to engineering majors through career clarification and goal setting; (3) reduce the barriers to success that students may face, particularly those for women and underrepresented students; and (4) enhance the positive personal and environmental factors for students in engineering.  The evaluation effort is being led by a experienced evaluator and is analyzing institutional data, satisfaction and attitudinal surveys, annual student academic and career plans, and two career interest inventories (i. e., the Strong Interest Inventory and the Skills Confidence Inventory). Broader impacts include the focus on underrepresented groups.

The approach is to integrate vanadium dioxide thin films with silicon cantilevers and test arrays of such devices in an optical readout system to be assembled. <br/>Recent discoveries show that vanadium dioxide-coated silicon cantilevers show an abrupt and large bending during the coating?s phase transition. This phenomenon will be applied to infrared sensing technologies. The preliminary work shows that by utilizing this actuation mechanism, an approximately 6-fold increase in sensitivity over the theoretical sensitivity limits of current technologies ? based on thermal expansion coefficient of bimorph cantilevers ? is possible. The thin vanadium dioxide films did not cause bending of the coated cantilevers at room temperature, which eliminates issues related to the flatness of the bimorph cantilevers currently used. This transformative work unveils a new technology that could impact other areas such as micro-electro-mechanical actuators. <br/>The broader impacts of this work can be found in the development of a new technology for infrared sensing, that offers resolutions and sensitivities unachievable at the current state-of-the-art. The development of this technology at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez will impact participant undergraduate and graduate students in this institution, since it will give them the opportunity to be part of this technology development and have hands-on experience in cleanroom technologies for the first time.

The interdisciplinary research theme ?molecules to muscles? is used as a vehicle to increase relevancy of science coursework to high school students by relating research advances in areas important to them (i.e. sports, soldier protection), while fellows will gain the ability to communicate to non-scientific audiences and researchers outside their field through an interdisciplinary team approach. Research improving human performance transcends the boundaries of individual scientific disciplines and requires seamless communication between biologists, chemists, biochemists, materials scientists and engineers.  Eight fellows will be recruited each year from the College of Science and Technology to work with HS science teachers to develop and deliver classroom activities based on fellows? research, ranging from polymer composites for sporting equipment to biochemical processes of respiration.  Fellows, teachers and high school students will gain appreciation for the integrative nature of scientific advancements through a unique interdisciplinary approach. C2M2 will impact a diverse group of fellows, teachers and HS students with the goal of developing future scientific leaders. Mississippi ranks 49th in participation in the high-tech industry and has the highest percentage African American population, a segment particularly underrepresented in advanced STEM degrees and careers, and The University of Southern Mississippi hosts a one-third minority student population. Results will be disseminated through a web-site, publications and presentations at education and scientific conferences. Industry support will help sustain GK-12 activities.

Biopores created by burrowing animals and invertebrates could have a significant influence on hydrological processes.  Understanding the burrowing process evokes interest among other disciplines such as soil morphology and entomology. Among the burrowing invertebrates, a species that has garnered significant attention in the U.S is the mole cricket. The project would be the first multi-disciplinary project to study biopore development by mole crickets and their effects on storage, transport, infiltration and runoff processes.  The project will synergistically study biopore development from both hydrologic and entomological perspectives. The influence of biopores on infiltration, contaminant transport and runoff processes will be studied as a function <br/>of their age, as the pores are developed by mole crickets. We will also study the effects of biological coatings of the biopores on soil hydraulics using micro-morphological techniques. The project includes laboratory/ field-scale experiments as well as modeling work, which will shed new light on the evolution of biopores due to burrowing mole crickets at different scales. The biopores created by mole crickets will also be compared with similar-sized artificial macropores for their effects on infiltration and contaminant transport. The results from the project will be characterized using appropriate mathematical models to simulate effects of biopores on hydrologic processes. Specifically, we will develop modeling methods to describe how and why the biopores are different from artificial macropores, in terms of anisotropy in their flow characteristics.<br/><br/>The project will have broader impacts on our knowledge of macropores from both hydrologic as well as entomological perspectives.  The project will improve our basic understanding of the biopore development and their effects on infiltration and runoff processes. New information will be available on the differences between biopores encountered in soils and the artificial macropores typically used in laboratory studies.  From an entomological perspective, the study will shed light on the burrowing behavior of mole crickets, the most important pest of recreational and pasture turfgrass in the southeastern U.S.  This project will provide new insights into the behavior of this pest and for developing more efficient pesticide delivery strategies for controlling mole crickets.

Biofuels produced from plant sources are one of the most promising renewable fuel options.  Development of necessary technologies for efficient production of biofuels requires a substantial expansion of infrastructure and vigorous research in related areas of science.<br/> <br/>This project develops teaching materials for a biochemistry laboratory course that incorporates current topics in biofuel research.  The new laboratory modules are designed to promote students' independent thinking, critical thinking and reasoning, and learning important concepts in biochemistry through guided inquiry and open inquiry experiments.  Such modules are able to encourage active student engagement in their learning by maintaining a focus throughout the entire course on important issues in science and society, specifically the energy crisis and environmental protection.  <br/> <br/>The main intellectual merit of this project is that it integrates a socio-economically relevant topic, biofuel synthesis, with research-based laboratory activities to enhance learning of important concepts in biochemistry.  This project has several broader impacts: its goals are to generate interest among minority undergraduate STEM students in energy-related careers that are in increasingly high demand, to train undergraduate STEM students to be competent in various modern laboratory techniques, and to prepare these students for careers in research.  A further goal is to promote the development of the next generation of scientists and educators who are going to face the challenge of solving environmental and energy problems.

For example, acidic and basic amino acids constitute about 25% of the residues in an average protein and almost 50% of the residues in the active site of proteins where reactions are carried out. Key processes in biology involve electron and proton transfer reactions and binding or transport of charged ligands.  This project focuses on the analysis of the change in free energy when charged groups associate with proteins, showing how these reaction equilibria are modified in biology. MCCE (Multi Conformation Continuum Electrostatics), developed at CCNY, which combines continuum electrostatics and molecular mechanics, will be the primary method used. The novel aspect of this work is that the protonation states of protein amino acids are allowed to remain at equilibrium with the bound and free states of a charged ligand. The affinities will be calculated with MCCE, with assists from Gaussian and GROMACS. In MCCE side chain positions and protonation states, ligand positions and site occupancy and where appropriate ligand redox and protonation states are all sampled together in one Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.  This project will carry out calculations of: (A) the pKas of buried charged groups, comparing the behavior of wild-type and introduced residues. pKas will be calculated for a new dataset of 100 buried charge mutations in Staphylococcal nuclease that have been determined by Garcia-Moreno (Johns Hopkins). The calculated dielectric relaxation in the mutants and wild type residues will be compared. In addition, this aspect of the project will be used to optimize methodology for calculating the changes caused by mutations. (B) The chloride affinity at different binding sites will be calculated in halorhodopsin (HR). There are structures of the homologous, proton-pumping bacteriorhodopsin (BR) trapped in different intermediate pumping states. These structures will be used as a basis to model the conformational changes that move chloride through HR. The comparison of HR and BR will focus on the nature of the gate allowing ions or protons to be pumped against a concentration gradient. (C) Kds, Ems and pKas will be calculated for quinones in the two quinone binding sites (QA and QB) of photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs). The relationship of the changes in binding affinity (Kd) and shifts in reaction free energy (ƒG∞) for protonation (ƒpKa) or redox reactions (ƒEm) for bound substrates or cofactors will be investigated. The thermodynamic relationship ƒG∞(reaction in protein) - ƒG∞(reaction in solution) = RTln(Kd(product) -Kd(reactant)) will be used to understand previously measured Em and pKa shifts for different quinones in RCs. The affinity of a series of neutral quinones in the QA and QB sites will be calculated and compared with measured values. The aspects of the structure that favor binding different quinones to each site will be identified. The affinity of quinone and semiquinone (SQ) will be compared to find the basis of Em shifts for different quinones in the QA site or for the same quinone in the QA and QB sites.<br/><br/>This project will be carried out at CCNY, a public, city university, with an extremely diverse, multi-ethnic student body. The students to be mentored reflect this diversity. The MCCE program, which is publicly available, will be developed, distributed and maintained. Methods of calculating ligand binding and best practices for calculating pKas of mutated residues developed to carry out the work in this project will be incorporated into the distributed program. A web-based pKa databank that currently has 35,000 predicted pKas will be revamped. The physics based analysis of proteins pKas and Ems will be incorporated into an advanced, interdisciplinary biophysics class.

It employs electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to probe the optical sensitivity and chemical reactivity of the Mg impurity in GaN. Specifically, changes in the thermal annealing behavior between films grown with the typical Mg concentration used in the present day devices and those grown by methods intended to achieve high hole densities are monitored. Further, the research involves a new method to probe the Mg impurity: time-dependent photo-EPR. Analysis of such data could provide information about charge exchange between Mg and other defects, which will likely change as Mg concentration is increased. Additional experiments include high frequency EPR available at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The high frequency experiments may reveal the local symmetry of the impurity and the role of strain. Overall, the project is designed to investigate factors that limit effective p-type doping and may provide direction to maximize hole density and conductivity of GaN.<br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. A success of the research project could contribute to development of better light emitting diodes and electronic devices.

Annotating ncRNAs in different organisms is thus highly important to modern biology. Among numerous efforts made for ncRNA detection, a few programs can be practically applied to whole genomes or large-scale databases. However, these genome-scale tools rely on conventional comparative sequence analysis, which cannot not effectively account for structural conservation in homologous ncRNAs and thus jeopardizes the sensitivity and accuracy of structured ncRNA search. In order to address the need of sensitive and fast large-scale ncRNA search, this project focuses on the development of novel and improved ncRNA detection algorithms that combine the efficiency of conventional sequence comparison tools and the structural features of ncRNAs. The specific objectives are: (1) fast known ncRNA identification algorithms and tools that can efficiently classify a large number of putative ncRNAs into corresponding ncRNA families, (2) highly efficient genome-scale sequence comparison algorithms for ncRNA homology search, and (3) a novel ncRNA structure modeling and comparison method.<br/><br/>The research goals of this project and the training needs of computational biology are integrated with the following educational objectives and plans. 1) Improve the awareness of computational biology as an important research area among students in biology and engineering. A new computational biology course for both senior undergraduates and graduates has been designed and is offered every fall.  2) Improve cross-disciplinary research training experiences for graduate and undergraduate students through MSU's Quantitative Biology Initiative (QBI) dual-major degree program. 3) Encourage retention and recruitment of underrepresented groups in computational biology related majors. The PI will continue to attend the K-12 women students outreach through Women in Engineering Summer Program every year, and help undergraduate women students through Women In Computing organization at MSU.

The use of digital media to introduce fundamental computer science concepts shows promise to rejuvenate the interest of millennial students.  This project builds on previous success to introduce the creation and sharing of artistic works into Computer Science II.  It centers on the activity of converting raw data (text) into useful information (art).  This requires students to think at multiple levels of abstraction.  The project combines active, problem-based and service learning activities.  One example of service learning is that college students volunteer as mentors at a local elementary after-school program.  Elementary school students are introduced to simple and engaging computer programs to create art.  Curricular materials are designed to be reused and easily adapted by other instructors.  The approach draws upon the literature for recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups through its emphases on the creation of artistic works, collaboration, social context and reflection.

This project will examine the influence of visual information on muscle and joint coordination related to the control of the body's center of mass and head position. The generality of sensory influences on multijoint coordination will be assessed by modifying tactile information from the support surface. Finally, the work will examine how postural stability is maintained when some of the body's segments are prevented from moving, analogous to what may occur as a result of injury and some disease processes.<br/><br/>Poor standing balance is a leading contributor to falls and subsequent hospitalization of the elderly and this project may provide important insights to guide the development of new treatments. The project will also provide laboratory experiences for undergraduate students (through the University of Delaware's Undergraduate Research Program) and  for  high school students (through the STEM program of Cecil County, Maryland). The work fosters an international collaboration between investigators at the University of Maryland and the University of Delaware and those at the University of Bochum in Germany, including international research experience for a graduate student from each of the two participating U.S. universities.<br/><br/>This work is co-funded by SBE/BCS, EPSCoR, and the Office of International Science and Engineering.
0943742	Collaborative Research: Present and future contribution of glacial runoff to freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska	EAR	HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES, EPSCoR Co-Funding	06/15/2010	05/18/2012	Regine Hock	AK	University of Alaska Fairbanks Campus	Continuing grant	Thomas Torgersen	05/31/2014	$350,000.00	Jing Zhang	rehock@alaska.edu	West Ridge Research Bldg 008	Fairbanks	AK	997757880	9074747301	GEO	1579, 9150	9150	$0.00	Freshwater influx to the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) is strongly influenced by glacier runoff as roughly one fifth of its drainage basin is covered by glacier ice. During the last decades GOA glaciers have generally thinned and retreated and hence precipitation stored in the glaciers as snow and ice has been released augmenting streamflow and freshwater influx to the Gulf of Alaska. Glaciers draining to the GOA are highly sensitive to climate warming and mass loss rates are expected to increase. It is hypothesized that runoff from glaciers will initially increase by more than 50% as wastage accelerates, but then will reach a turning point upon which runoff will decrease as the glaciers shrink and partly disappear. Hence, the changes in the hydrological cycles due to glacier wastage are substantially larger than expected changes in any other component of the water budget in this region.<br/><br/>The research will quantify these changes in runoff. A glacier runoff model is used to simulate the current magnitude and timing of runoff from glaciers that drain to the Gulf of Alaska and project how glacial runoff along the Gulf of Alaska will change by 2100 in response to future climate scenarios in Alaska downscaled by a high resolution regional climate model. Further, potential changes to the biogeochemical fluxes into freshwater and marine ecosystems associated with the projected changes in glacier runoff are assessed. Results provide regional scale estimates of glacier runoff changes and associated impacts on biogeochemical fluxes for the GOA. A modeling strategy is developed that can be used to evaluate glacier runoff changes and hydrologic ?tipping points? in other heavily glacierized regions. Moreover, the downscaled climate scenarios we develop will be available for other impact studies. Visualization products of the results are made available to the Mendenhall Glacier visitor center, which is visited by approximately 350,000 people each year.

The diversity (number and identity) of coinfecting pathogens can modulate both pathogen transmission among hosts and pathogen impacts on hosts. Nonetheless, little is known about the processes that govern pathogen diversity. This research will integrate field experiments and mathematical models to study the causes and consequences of pathogen diversity. The study consists of a model system of five viral pathogens of grasses (the cereal and barley yellow dwarf viruses). This approach will allow the investigation of the interacting roles of the pathogen species themselves, the insect vectors that transmit them, their plant hosts, climate conditions, and spatial processes in controlling the dynamics of systems that include multiple pathogen species. Further, it will elucidate the mechanisms by which pathogens interact, and evaluate the consequences of these interactions for pathogen transmission and host fitness.   <br/><br/>This study will be of both scientific and societal significance. The work will advance the understanding multi-pathogen dynamics - a key step towards developing a comprehensive understanding of the ecology of infectious disease. It will include participation of under-represented groups, community outreach, and dissemination of results through both public talks and peer-reviewed journals. The investigators will integrate this research with education at both K-12 and university levels. The pathogens are among the most economically important viruses of crops, so this study may have benefits for agriculture. Moreover, these pathogens provide an experimentally tractable model for vector-transmitted generalist pathogens, the dominant type of emerging pathogen of humans, crops, and other species.

This reactor helps to defeat the equilibrium limitation of the standard Claus Reaction and in addition allows one to capture hydrogen which is otherwise expended as a waste.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to focus attention on the production of sulfur from petroleum refinery waste streams of H2S instead of treating the  hydrogen as a waste exhaust gas (as the Claus process does). This process allows for the use of hydrogen both as a fuel and also to drive turbines and thereby save energy.  Furthermore, hydrogen is a carbonless fuel.

The mass spectrometer will be optimized for operation aboard an AUV glider and will be capable of identifying and quantifying atmospheric, geologic, and biologically derived gases (methane, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, sulfides, etc.) as well as many anthropogenic pollutants at levels down to parts-per-billion. It will fit within a glider payload volume and operate at low. <br/><br/>In-situ operation of these mass spectrometers onboard multiple AUV gliders will enable synoptic assessment of transient chemical phenomena such as deep-water upwelling, greenhouse gas cycling, red tides, and pulsed releases of chemicals caused by seismic events, storms, or human activity. As proof-of-concept the PI will integrate this mass spectrometer aboard a Slocum electric glider to characterize and persistently monitor water column chemistry in Massachusetts coastal waters and near the New England Shelf Break. This work will leverage the PI?s ongoing research in instrumentation development, autonomous robotics, and real-time environmental monitoring.  <br/><br/>The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop a cost-effective MS-glider technology for measuring dissolved gas variability relating to biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon in the subsurface marine water column; 2) Demonstrate this technology via deployments in coastal New England environments, then in long-range transects off the Atlantic shelf break, thereby validating a new means of observation for NSF?s OOI and other ocean observation programs; and 3) Integrate this research program into broad-based student curricula to promote engineering and science literacy.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:   <br/><br/>The proposed education program will provide exciting learning experiences for students from Middle school ages to graduate school. Today's students are often turned on by hands-on engineering projects and opportunities to analyze near-realtime data streams. This project offers both, plus avenues to introduce students to field work and sea expeditions. The PI is well situated to integrate his research into broad-based educational programs. The PI intends to provide broad-based exposure to STEM curricula and active learning experiences for students ranging from 8th graders, to high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. One of the most notable aspects of the proposal, in terms of the broader impacts, is Camilli's plan to work closely with schools that serve economically disadvantaged and underrepresented students at the middle or high school level. By supporting the 'teach the teacher' approach for the high school program, the PI will extend his reach to bring high quality STEM education to more students more consistently than he can do on his own. The PI will also provide education and training activities for undergraduate and graduate students.

Using sonar-equipped Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV), students will develop (1) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms to construct 3D maps, and (2) new 3D visualization techniques for underwater robotics applications.  In parallel with the research activities, students will participate in a Global Engineering course that explores the historical, archaeological and cultural aspects of research, education and collaboration through multiple national contexts.<br/><br/>The research activities bring together an international team of archaeologists, robotics and visualization experts and has a range of broader impacts.  For example, by systematically surveying cisterns, investigators are better able to understand the development of Malta's ancient water storage systems and subsequently inform current water management strategy and policy. The robotics and visualization technology developed will also be relevant to applications in oceanography, biology, homeland security and defense.  Throughout the project, student investigators will communicate their results to multiple audiences, including bilingual English and Spanish students at Pacheco Elementary School in San Luis Obispo, CA.

As the Universe expanded and cooled, the quarks and gluons condensed into the protons and neutrons which now make up the cores of all atoms.   This phase transition from a hot, dense plasma to a gas of normal matter is similar to that of steam condensing into liquid water.  Using large particle accelerators, scientists are recreating this subatomic soup in the laboratory by colliding gold or lead atoms at very high energies and studying the intriguing properties of this unusual state of matter.   One of the most important discoveries to come from experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is that the dense matter is opaque to very high energy quarks and gluons produced in the collisions.  These `partons' suffer tremendous energy loss as they make their way out of the collision zone, depositing a large fraction of their initial energy in the medium.  The strength of this energy loss is directly related to the density of the quark gluon plasma and varies according to the type of parton.  From observations at RHIC, the heavier quarks appear to be more strongly coupled to the quark gluon plasma than was previously expected.   High energy electrons are produced by the decays of particles made from heavy quarks, so their presence within the cluster of particles that comprise an observed jet is strong evidence for the jet to have originated from a heavy quark.  The energy loss of these electron-jets can be used to investigate the properties of the quark gluon plasma.<br/><br/>The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland will collide nuclei at energies 30 times higher than at RHIC, producing an even hotter, denser, longer-lived medium.  This RUI project will utilize the ALICE experiment to explore the properties of this matter using the energy loss of heavy quark jets as a probe.  Undergraduate students working on this experiment will be trained in the most advanced data collection, reduction and analysis techniques at the cutting edge of high energy nuclear physics.  They will be able to apply these skills in a wide variety of careers, whether they choose to pursue an advanced degree in basic science or not.  Their contributions will also help us develop new insights into the fundamental interactions among the basic building blocks of the universe, leading to a deeper understanding of the world around us.

Experimental tests of N vs. phosphorus (P) limitation in temperate forest systems are lacking.  This study will combine modeling and field studies to explore processes mediating nutrient colimitation in relation to successional change in managed hardwood forest ecosystems.  An improved understanding of ecosystem optimization of resource use, including the maintenance of co-limitation, is important to forest management, environmental protection, and basic scientific knowledge. Balanced nutrient cycling is essential to maintaining forest sustainability, and scientists and managers at the White Mountain National Forest will evaluate silvicultural practices in light of results from the proposed research.  For example, their forest management plans require justifying intensive harvest removals in terms of the ability of forests to acquire nutrients for regrowth.  Feedbacks such as the biological enhancement of mineral weathering when nutrients are limiting are clearly relevant to this appraisal.<br/>The Multi-Element Limitation (MEL) model represents co-limitation from the perspective of resource optimization theory and ecosystem biogeochemistry. We have extended the model to include P as well as N, carbon, light, and water, and applied it to simulate primary and secondary succession in northern hardwood forests. Using nutrient additions of N alone in some forest stands, P alone in some forest stands, N+P in some forest stands,  in replicated stands of three ages (~20, 30, and > 100 years) at the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, we will test the patterns of resource limitation predicted by the model and multiple mechanisms of allocation of effort to acquire N and P.  Specifically, the model predicts a greater response of aboveground productivity to N+P than N or P alone. In older stands, it predicts a greater response to N than to P addition, but in younger stands, the model suggests that the supply of N from detritus should be sufficient to create P limitation.

Several lines of research have shown that children's number estimation acuity at the age of 3 years and their understanding of cardinal numbers when they enter kindergarten both predict performance on standardized mathematics tests many years thereafter.<br/><br/>The observation component will assess 260 children at ages 3 and 4 years and will be the first comprehensive, baseline description of the number knowledge of low-income English Language Learner (ELL) preschoolers. By assessing children in both Spanish and English, this study will separately describe (a) the children's knowledge of number concepts, and (b) the degree to which this knowledge can be expressed in English. Three comparison groups will also be tested: low-income English monolinguals, middle-income English monolinguals, and middle income Spanish/English simultaneous bilinguals. The children will be tested in 2 sessions, 6 months apart, on 10 measures that include such variables as receptive vocabulary in English and the home language, approximate number system (ANS) acuity, knowledge of the linguistic number systems of English and the home language, family demographic information, and attentional control. The intervention component will focus on 160 children from low-income households where Spanish is spoken. Three-year-olds will be randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. <br/><br/>The intervention has previously been shown to improve English monolingual children's knowledge of the linguistic number system and may also help children map preverbal approximate number representations to number words. It is hoped that the observation and intervention studies can lead to similar gains in this vulnerable and understudied ELL population.

Friction and lubrication play an important role in everyday experience. Many biological surfaces such as such as cartilage, airway surface layers in the lungs, mucin layers in the eyes, are covered with a brush-like polyelectrolyte layer consisting of glycoproteins. These brush layers have remarkably low friction coefficient in the range 0.001-0.03 and can withstand pressures of the order of ten atmospheres.<br/><br/>The PI will use a combination of the molecular dynamics simulations, self-consistent field calculations, and scaling analysis to develop a model of lubrication of glycoprotein layers.  This approach is based on a coarse-grained model of glycoprotein in which it is represented as a strongly charged molecular bottlebrush consisting of side chains grafted to the main chain backbone. The research will focus on the interaction between two bottlebrush layers. Theory and simulation will be used to calculate the brush layer thickness, the layer compressibility, and the chain relaxation dynamics as a function of salt concentration, solution pH, fraction of charged groups, the molecular architecture, and the sliding velocity. Molecular dynamics simulations will be performed with explicit solvent to elucidate the effect of the hydrodynamic coupling on the energy dissipation in sliding polyelectrolyte layers. The developed model will be applied to describe lubrication in multilayered polyelectrolyte coatings. <br/><br/>The simulation and theoretical results will be compared with experimental data for friction coefficient between synthetic bottlebrush layers and between two multilayer coatings. This study may help to discover new routes for developing polymeric coatings with excellent lubricating properties for biomedical applications.      <br/><br/>This research project will train graduate students in modern analytical and computational techniques. High school students will also be exposed to the research through the UConn Mentor Connection Program.

Friction and lubrication are a part of our everyday experience ranging from machinery to biological organisms. Many connective tissues, such as cartilage, demonstrate excellent lubrication and wear characteristics. Cartilage in the joints of mammals can withstand pressures ten times atmospheric pressure and move with remarkably little friction. The surface of the cartilage is covered with a brush-like layer of large chain-like molecules that have electrical charges. This brush layer, which faces a similar layer on the opposing cartilage, is sheared as two surfaces slide passing each other during joint motion. The PI will use computer simulations and theoretical methods to understand the complex interaction between brush layers and how it leads to the lubricating properties of biological and chain-like molecular systems. This knowledge will enable the explanation of the low friction between sliding surfaces of the cartilage. This research will help advance understanding of lubrication properties of other biological surfaces, such as airways surface layer in lungs and the mucin layer in gastrointestinal tract, where brush-like molecules form protective interfacial layers.<br/><br/>This research project will train graduate students in modern analytical and computational techniques. High school students will also be exposed to the research through the UConn Mentor Connection Program.  This will broaden students intellectually and provide each with a unique insight into the problems and technology of the future. <br/>Mentoring of students is integrated into every aspect of the proposed research.  Graduate students will work with undergraduate physics, chemistry or chemical engineering students and with talented high school students. This experience will prepare them for future academic careers. <br/>Underrepresented groups in education and scientific research will be involved through the Honors Program and existing infrastructure of the REU sites.<br/><br/>The results of the proposed research will be incorporated into the course sequences on ?Polymer Physics?, and ?Polymer Physical Chemistry? as well as into a new special topics course ?Ion-containing polymers?.

The answer to this question will fundamentally shape the future direction of neutrino physics regarding the neutrino mass scale and possible CP violations in the lepton sector. Neutrino-less double beta decay experiments can have broad scientific impact: they are sensitive to the absolute scale of the electron neutrino mass and shed light on the nature of the extension to the Standard Model; furthermore, neutrinos, if they are Majorana and with CP violation, may provide a viable physical process contributing to the matter and anti-matter asymmetry of the Universe. The UCLA group is a member of the CUORE neutrino-less double beta decay experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Assergi, Italy. <br/><br/>The research effort will focus on understanding background sources and detector energy resolutions. They will participate in setting up a tower of CUORE TeO2 crystals and will be involved in the Monte Carlo simulations of the CUORE background and data analysis. In addition, the UCLA group is responsible for testing, installation and commissioning of the CUORE electronics system in collaboration with the University of South Carolina and Milan groups as a part of the CUORE construction project. The electronics performance will be a key aspect contributing to the overall detector capability to advance our experimental determination of the neutrino properties. The corresponding sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass ranges from 50-70 meV, if latest nuclear structure calculations are used.<br/><br/>Among the Broader Impacts: it is an international collaboration between Italy and US scientists; the bolometer and electronics technology will have applications such as nuclear radiation measurements for physics or homeland security or applied sciences; and neutrino physics and the new technology are particularly exciting for undergraduate students.
1013982	SBIR Phase I:  Three-axis Vector Magnetometer with Novel Z-axis Sensor	IIP	SMALL BUSINESS PHASE I	07/01/2010	06/01/2010	Joseph Davies	MN	NVE CORPORATION	Standard Grant	Muralidharan S. Nair	03/31/2011	$149,808.00		jdavies@nve.com	11409 VALLEY VIEW RD	EDEN PRAIRIE	MN	553443617		ENG	5371	1185, 5371, 7331, 9139, HPCC	$0.00	This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of combining novel nanostructured cobalt-transition metal (Co/TM, TM= Ni, Pd, Pt, Au) multilayer films with magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) to produce a z-axis magnetic field sensor with application to a 3-axis vector magnetometer.  Nanostructured Co/TM multilayers are unique in that their magnetization direction can be tailored to be normal to the film plane.   Thus an increased sensitivity to magnetic fields applied along the film normal direction can be established.  These materials have readily tunable growth parameters making them ideal for a range of applications, however much of the research has focused on magnetic media with large amount of magnetic hysteresis.  Here novel Co/TM-based MTJ?s will be developed and produced with the hysteresis minimized by tailoring the perpendicular anisotropy as well as sensor geometry in order to demonstrate a viable z-axis field sensor.  The expected result is that sensors with sensitivity comparable to conventional ?in-plane? magnetoresistive sensors will be demonstrated and presented in connection with this technology?s incorporation into a 3-axis vector magnetometer.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project would be significant in that many areas from navigation, biomedical, security to consumer electronics would benefit from the proposed z-axis sensor and resulting single-chip 3-axis magnetometer.  Current technology typically uses multi-chip or coil configurations, greatly increasing the device footprint.  Otherwise, less sensitive Hall sensors are used.  The novel z-axis sensor proposed here would allow for placement of a more sensitive z-axis sensor in the same package as the in-plane sensors and greatly reduce the footprint and improve performance.  This is particularly critical in portable biomedical, security and consumer electronics applications that continually look to increase functionality while reducing device size.  This device configuration would also reduce the required power compared to conventional AMR sensors, making a more efficient use of battery life for portable devices.  The development of the magnetically soft Co/TM multilayer films required for this application could also have applications beyond vector magnetometry as the required properties are also sought after for applications such as power generation and current tunable oscillators.  The technology from this project will have high commercialization potential with the obtained scientific knowledge being applicable to other areas that look to utilize nanostructured magnetic materials.

The team is examining the properties of nanometer scale clusters (from as small as 6 atoms up to 1000 atoms) in the gas-phase by a combined experimental and computational approach. Specifically, the dissociation of metal clusters, Mn --> Mn-1 + M (where M is a metal and n is the number of atoms in a metal cluster) is monitored experimentally using tandem differential mobility analysis. These experiments are the first ever measurements of single atom evaporation from gas phase neutral, cationic, and anionic metal clusters at atmospheric pressure. Simultaneously, the dissociation rates of metal clusters are inferred from molecular dynamics trajectory simulations allowing for direct comparison of  experimental measurements and computational predictions. Of particular interest in measurements and computations is the identification of anomalous magic number and anti-magic number clusters, which are either anomalously stable or unstable, respectively. The existence of these magic number clusters vastly alters the rate of nucleation for gas phase metal clusters. The team of researchers infers the rate of cluster formation and growth from the measured and computed rates of dissociation for metal clusters, enabling comparison of cluster growth rate predictions to experimental measurements in a newly designed turbulent mixing metal cluster growth reactor.<br/> <br/>These experiments and simulations elucidate the behavior of metallic clusters, thus providing the basis for the design of future synthesis systems for multi component metallic materials with nanoscale features. This area of research has technological applications in environmental and materials sciences, e. g., waste incineration and coal burning exhausts. This project is interdisciplinary in nature, bridging the disciplines of physical chemistry and mechanical engineering. It is unique in that it incorporates both newly developed experimental techniques and cutting-edge molecular simulations, where overlap has thus far been sparse. Moreover, these studies are part of a vital effort to link the properties of materials at the molecular scale to properties of bulk materials. Additional broader impacts of these studies include the interdisciplinary education of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers involved in the project, including the development of new interdisciplinary courses focusing on the properties of nanometer scale clusters from both the  chemist's and engineer's perspective.

The workshops will be held in Braza, Italy-April 2010, San Francisco, CA July 2010, and Seville, Spain September 2010. These meetings are held adjacent to international conference so that other attendees with the background in Emerging Research Devices (ERD) and Emerging Research Materials (ERM) can participate in the meetings. The University faculty invited to attend these meetings contribute valuable input to the four mini-workshops. This set of mini-workshops is in continuation of the series of workshops that have been held in 2004, 2006 and 2008 <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: <br/><br/>These mini-workshops provide highly interactive forums where key research leaders in the Semiconductor Industry and the related academic communities seek to evaluate the status of nanoelectronics research, discuss potential applications, and define promising future research directions. This will enable the 2011 version of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) to reflect an informed view on key scientific and technical challenges related to post-CMOS information processing technologies proposed for post-CMOS devices, based on new quantitative analyses and projections. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/>The educational value and planning impact of these workshops on the international research community are quite substantial. Several universities (e.g., Stanford, U. Minnesota, U. Tokyo, ) use the ITRS chapters on Emerging Research Devices and Emerging Research Materials resulting from these workshops as texts in their Nanoelectronics courses. Also several international research funding agencies (e.g., the SRC, NSF, and NIST Nanoelectronics Research Initiative, the EU Framework Program 8, ) use the material in these chapters as inputs to their decisions on research directions in their Nanoelectronics research programs.

The project approach seeks to correlate investigations of exciton diffusion carried out using steady-state and ultrafast spectroscopies as well as device based results. These studies are expected to be able to identify the most promising and accurate means of characterizing exciton diffusion, and to also elucidate the role of molecular structure and singlet-triplet exciton intersystem crossing on the diffusing species and mechanism. The latter will assist in clarification of the potential role phosphorescent materials can play in OPVs. <br/><br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics--the basic scientific findings of the project are expected to assist significantly with the development of alternative energy sources. Additionally, the PIs have made a priority of the education of elementary, high school, undergraduate and graduate students on issues relating to energy, and the role materials can play in renewable energy systems. Multiple programs will be undertaken including educational outreach for school children in the 3rd through 12th grades, summer research experience for high school students, research opportunities for undergraduate students through programs including the University of Minnesota (UMN) Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) and MRSEC REU programs, as well as the integration of research results into undergraduate and graduate classes in Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Chemistry will be undertaken. The PIs will also disseminate results of the proposed work to industry through the UMN Industrial Partnership for Research in Interfacial and Materials Engineering (IPrime), which provides opportunities for professionals in industry to collaborate with researchers at the UMN. The PIs typically help co-organize and participate in the IPrime annual meeting, which offers students the opportunity to present their research to member companies. The project research and education activities represent an important contribution to the education of students and the wider community both at and beyond the UMN.

This area is of interest to insure sustained and increased reliability in health-related, transportation, high performance computing, and self-sustainable energy systems.     One cause of reduced reliability is the increasing probability of device failure as feature sizes of integrated circuits are reduced.  However, with the increased presence of analog circuits and components as parts of systems as well as the increased 3-D integration density, other reliability concerns arise.  Besides the problem of reduced device reliability and increased parameter uncertainty, the complicated coupling between densely integrated components, circuits, packaging and sub-systems is often too complex to be fully considered in the design.  Failure of such systems is not of the traditional pass/fail nature and might be caused by either design errors (or poor designs) or operational conditions.  Instead, for mixed-signal components as well as for systems at the application level, there is more concern with graceful degradation, recovery from transient and permanent errors, and robust behavior at the system level. This suggests that an integrated approach incorporating all levels of the design hierarchy is necessary to provide reliability to the system user. This workshop will bring together a select group of experts in the relevant fields of mixed-signal circuit and system design, simulation, and testing. The workshop will assess research needs for ensuring resistance to failure in safety-critical areas including medical, transportation, and aerospace applications.
1009959	Multiscale PDE Asymptotics for Tropical Atmospheric Waves	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	07/01/2010	06/22/2010	Joseph Biello	CA	University of California-Davis	Standard Grant	Michael H. Steuerwalt	06/30/2015	$191,572.00		BIELLO@MATH.UCDAVIS.EDU	OR/Sponsored Programs	Davis	CA	956186134	5307547700	MPS	1266		$0.00	Biello<br/>DMS-1009959<br/><br/>     Our understanding of tropical meteorology and its ability to<br/>influence the middle latitudes is the major stumbling block to<br/>increasing medium term (two week) weather prediction over the<br/>United States (midlatitudes).  The investigator studies<br/>multiscale asymptotics for the partial differential equations<br/>that govern tropical atmosphere atmospheric waves and their<br/>connection to midlatitude waves, extending his previous work in<br/>the field.  The three aspects of this project are: (1) The effect<br/>of the climatological flow (the Hadley circulation) on the<br/>Intraseasonal Multiscale Moist Dynamics models of the<br/>Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO); (2) The effect of mean shear on<br/>the non-linear interaction of equatorial Rossby or Kelvin waves<br/>with midlatitude Rossby waves; (3) The coupling of tropical waves<br/>to a stochastic model of moist convection and the derivation of a<br/>closed, single scale, stochastic model of the Madden-Julian<br/>Oscillation.  This last project could yield a transformative<br/>development because it would be the first MJO model whose<br/>structure is systematically derived from multiscale asymptotics<br/>(Biello and Majda) and whose convective forcing arises from a<br/>tested model of cloud dynamics (Khouider, Biello and Majda). <br/><br/>     The effect of small and fast phenomena on large and slower<br/>phenomena is a ubiquitous question in modern science and<br/>policy-making.  In economics, for example, the question may be<br/>phrased, How do individual actions organize to yield steady<br/>economic conditions or unstable economic conditions?  In<br/>atmospheric science, this question is manifested as How do small<br/>scale events such as storms and storm systems organize themselves<br/>to affect the mean climate in which they sit?  While large<br/>modern computational simulations have yielded many insights into<br/>this multi-scale organization, they are limited in that the<br/>smallest structures they can resolve are still large; for<br/>example, most climate computations cannot see structures smaller<br/>than 60 miles across.  So, the equations that these computers<br/>solve must resort to a model (whether empirically determined, or<br/>ad hoc) in order to describe these unresolved structures.  A more<br/>systematic approach is to use techniques of modern applied<br/>mathematics in order to isolate the phenomena at each scale that<br/>are the essential elements of this multi-scale coupling.  The<br/>investigator's work focuses on using these modern applied math<br/>techniques to understand the multi-scale coupling of the tropical<br/>atmosphere.  Specifically, he seeks to understand how storm<br/>systems, which live for several days, organize to affect<br/>planetary scale wind patterns, which modulate over the course of<br/>several months.  Furthermore, these wind patterns generate<br/>weather waves that propagate away from the tropics over the<br/>continental U.S.  The investigator uses similar mathematical<br/>techniques to understand this wave generation.  Improving our<br/>understanding of these phenomena will increase the accuracy of US<br/>weather forecasts.

A defining feature of the mathematics of quantum theory is non-commutativity, the idea the A times B does not always equal B times A.  This is reflected in experiments in quantum mechanics that the outcomes of measurements depends on the order in which they are measured; moreover, measurements in quantum mechanics are inherently statistical.  The phenomenon of non-commutativity leads to surprising new algorithms that could run on quantum computers if they are one day constructed.  In mathematics itself, quantum-style non-commutativity has led to many new ideas in geometry, such as new notions of symmetry, and in topology, such as new methods to describe and distinguish knots and similar topological objects.  The PI plans to investigate connections and new constructions among all of these types of quantum mathematics.
1011811	CIF: Large: Collaborative Research:  Cooperation and Learning Over Cognitive Networks	CCF	NETWORK SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, COMM & INFORMATION FOUNDATIONS, SENSOR NETWORKS	09/01/2010	07/10/2012	Anna Scaglione	CA	University of California-Davis	Continuing grant	John Cozzens	07/31/2015	$494,845.00		Anna.Scaglione@asu.edu	OR/Sponsored Programs	Davis	CA	956186134	5307547700	CSE	7794, 7797, 7938	7925, 7936, 9218, HPCC	$0.00	Cooperation and Learning over Cognitive Networks<br/>Studies on herding and self-organization in economics and the social and biological sciences have observed that coordination among multiple agents leads to regular patterns of behavior and swarm intelligence, even when each group member shows limited behavioral complexity. In ant colonies, for example, individual ants cannot capture rich spatial information from their environment because of their limited sensing ability. Nevertheless, when the ants coordinate their activities within a colony, the group ends up exhibiting better sensing abilities. Using signal processing and communications techniques, the research studies how and why such manifestations of rational and organized behavior arise at the group level from local interactions among agents with limited abilities, what communication topologies enable such behavior, and what type of signal processing enables such formations.  <br/><br/>This research seeks to understand and reverse-engineer the distributed intelligence encountered in socio-economic-biological networks, by investigating relations with learning and rationality over cognitive networks. The latter are adaptive networks that avoid centralized information processing and perform in-network inference and control decisions. Cognitive networks contrast with networks that rely on centralized and parallel information fusion, which are not scalable, are hard to adapt to changing topologies, and suffer from points of vulnerability and information bottlenecks.  The research considers large scale networks of agents and studies how global (rational or irrational) patterns of behavior emerge, including herds, contagions and bubbles in economics. An understanding of how the biotic environment influences collective behavior in animal societies provides a real world guide to good cognitive networks, which can be used in turn to design engineered systems. Cognitive networks have applications in areas ranging from precision agriculture, to environmental monitoring, disaster relief management, and smart spaces.
1009538	Nonlinear hyperbolic waves and interfaces	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	07/01/2010	06/22/2010	John Hunter	CA	University of California-Davis	Standard Grant	Pedro Embid	06/30/2013	$263,960.00		jkhunter@ucdavis.edu	OR/Sponsored Programs	Davis	CA	956186134	5307547700	MPS	1266		$0.00	The project addresses the mathematical modeling and analysis of nonlinear, nondispersive wave propagation in continuum mechanics. It focuses on waves modeled by nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, and related equations, that propagate along boundaries or interfaces (such as discontinuities in vorticity, vortex sheets, material boundaries, and shock waves). These surface waves often display a complex nonlocal, nonlinear behavior which is not well-understood. The principal investigator will derive and study reduced asymptotic equations that describe these waves in a range of physical applications. A typical feature of the resulting nonlocal quasilinear equations is that they are Hamiltonian, and they may be expressed in both spectral and spatial forms, leading to connections with multilinear harmonic analysis. Fundamental questions concerning these equations include the life-span of smooth solutions, the formation and physical interpretation of singularities, and the global existence of weak solutions.<br/><br/>Surface waves are waves that propagate along a boundary or interface. Since they are guided along an interface, they decay more slowly than bulk waves, which explains why the surface seismic waves generated by an earthquake are the most destructive far from their source. Surface waves are widely used in technological applications, such as ultrasonic surface acoustic wave devices in cell phones or nanophotonic surface plasmon devices, because they are directly accessible to detection and manipulation. Small-amplitude waves are well-described by linear equations, but nonlinear effects become important at larger amplitudes and lead to qualitatively new phenomena such as the formation of singularities (for example, shock waves in a compressible fluid). Nonlinearity makes the mathematical analysis of these problems very challenging. An additional feature of surface waves is that the effects of nonlinearity may be nonlocal because what happens at one point on the surface can influence what happens elsewhere on the surface through the bulk medium. The principal investigator plans to study the fundamental qualitative properties of such nonlinear, nonlocal surface waves in the context of a wide variety of physical problems. The results will have potential applications in fluid dynamics, including transonic flow, elasticity, magnetohydrodynamics, geophysics, and condensed matter physics.

Profs. Balch and Olmstead and their students will synthesize new fullerene derivatives that contain metal atoms in their backbone. These new fullerenes will be assembled to create unique metal organic frameworks and networks with unconventional chemical reactivity properties. These new and innovative materials are potentially transformative since they could be used as components of greatly improved catalysts and gas storage devices.

1007739	Mixing Times of Markov Chains with Applications to Cryptography	DMS	PROBABILITY	07/01/2010	06/15/2010	Benjamin Morris	CA	University of California-Davis	Standard Grant	Tomek Bartoszynski	06/30/2014	$244,223.00		morris@math.ucdavis.edu	OR/Sponsored Programs	Davis	CA	956186134	5307547700	MPS	1263		$0.00	The investigator will study problems in discrete probability, most of which concern mixing times for Markov chains. The Thorp shuffle, which is a method of card shuffling based on local swaps has found applications to applied cryptography. It is the basis of a new algorithm to encipher small messages such as social security numbers. Recently, algorithms based on variants of the Thorp shuffle that use both local and global swaps have been proposed. It is planned to obtain good mixing time bounds for these shuffles. These shuffles appear to have a very strong mixing property that relates to the cryptographic notion of indifferentiability. It is planned to prove this rigorously. It is also planned to study a number of problems concerning random walks on graphs, including Aldous and Fill's conjecture that for coalescing random walks, the expected time for all particles to coalesce is at most a constant times the maximum expected hitting time of any vertex.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to find improved methods to analyze Markov chains. Markov chains have been used widely in statistics, statistical physics, simulation and optimization. This project focuses on Markov chains used in small space encryption algorithms. With rising concerns about identity theft, methods to encrypt small messages such as social security numbers are of great practical interest.

The main emphasis of the research is on statistical properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large random matrices. <br/>In particular, the P.I. intends to study the distribution of the largest eigenvalues in Wigner, sample covariance, and related ensembles of random matrices. The P.I. proposes to establish local universality results for a sufficiently wide class of such random matrices.  In addition to employing the method of moments, the P.I. has been recently developing the resolvent method that allows one to establish the system of recursive relations for local linear statistics of the eigenvalues.  Also, the P.I. will work with his Ph.D. students Sean O'Rourke, Pierre Dueck, and David Renfrew on the Gaussian fluctuation of the eigenvalues in the bulk of the spectrum and on the spectral properties of the deformed Wigner ensembles of random matrices.<br/><br/><br/>Over the last few decades, Random Matrix Theory has become one of the most exciting areas of mathematics and theoretical physics with applications ranging from Quantum Mechanics (statistical properties of highly excited energy levels of heavy nuclei), Theoretical Computer Science (computational complexity, statistical analysis of errors, linear numerical algorithms), Mathematical Finance, and Biology. To indicate the breadth of applications of Random Matrix Theory techniques, it can be commented that recent works of the P.I. have been cited by such diverse groups of researchers as faculty members of Harvard Medical School working in Population Biology and experts from the Capital Fund Management group (France) working in Financial Mathematics.  In addition, Random Matrix Theory has deep connections to many areas of modern Mathematics, including the famous Riemann hypothesis about the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function.

In this collaborative effort involving the University of California at Davis and Harvard University, the PIs will focus on the design and implementation of parallel hash tables, one of the most fundamental of data structures, on the new platforms.  Real-time parallel hashing would enable a variety of graphics applications on dynamically changing data, including spatial hashing, surface and image matching, and hashed octrees which in turn enable a host of other applications including Boolean surface operations, point-cloud nearest neighbors, ray-tracing acceleration and photon mapping.  In prior work, the PIs built a baseline implementation that shows effective parallel hashing can be done on the GPU; they can construct the table as quickly as the fastest available radix sort, and can execute parallel random access on the elements much more quickly than binary search.  In the current research, the PIs plan to improve upon their baseline implementation significantly, while also focusing on related structures such as multi-maps and Bloom filters.  New designs and construction algorithms will be developed, implemented, and analyzed with respect to performance, and then applied to a variety of computer graphics applications. The PIs expect this work to lead to interesting theoretical results; modern hash table constructions have never been considered in the parallel context, so finding the right model for analysis is one goal of the research.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This project will contribute to the computing infrastructure, not only for computer graphics but also for general-purpose computation.  The PIs will distribute their implementations freely, in part by extending and building upon their existing (and popular) library of general-purpose data structures (the CUDA Data Parallel Primitives).  The PIs note that making the most of the  emerging parallel GPU resources requires training the next generation of programmers to think in parallel; therefore, they plan to exploit this project as an opportunity to revive a long-untaught undergraduate parallel programming course, in addition to studying parallel algorithms with their graduate students.

The approaches are being optimized on existing FT-IR and Raman imaging systems, and applied to study structure evolution in complex human tissues during malignant transformation. <br/><br/>Imaging has traditionally focused on visualizing structure. This project broadly focuses on effectively visualizing the chemistry of materials by enhancing theory and computation in the emerging area of CI. The data enhancement approaches developed in this project will be broadly applicable to multiple analytical techniques and to all fields of application. Hence, the project is expected to widely accelerate scientific discovery and technological progress in, for example, materials science (e.g. in polymer composites), biological sciences (e.g. in lethal cancer transformation), and forensics (e.g. detecting prints). The developed tools and educational activities will enhance infrastructure and help build the national and international CI community. Tools and dissemination proposed here will help build partnerships between CI, computational, and biomedical scientists - allowing for rapid dissemination of results to industry and other practitioners. The project will train a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in cross-disciplinary science, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, and computing. Underrepresented groups will be involved and nurtured into this emerging area by sustained mentoring. Finally, the developed techniques are expected to be translated to commercial instruments, contributing to widespread use.

The PI will focus on a particular class of polymers, polyelectrolytes, that acquire an electric charge in solution. Because of the electric charges, there are additional interactions among the long molecular chains and also between the chains and the particles or proteins also present in the solution.<br/>The PI will advance conceptual understanding of these mixtures and develop new ways to use computers to simulate them. A better understanding of these mixtures has potential impact on understanding important biological processes, the food industry, particularly on the texture, stability, and taste of engineered food, and methods for synthesizing materials to achieve desired properties. <br/><br/>The simulation approaches developed in the course of the research will be used to develop simulation modules that will be used in graduate and undergraduate courses. They will also be integrated into different outreach activities and web-based module repositories to be used in classrooms throughout the country.

Eavey	05/31/2015	$266,863.00		jennifer.miller@austin.utexas.edu	3925 W Braker Lane, Ste 3.11072	Austin	TX	787595316	5124716424	SBE	1333, 1352	0000, 1333, 1352, OTHR	$0.00	The use of species distribution models (SDM) to map and monitor animal and plant distributions has become increasingly important in the context of awareness of environmental change and its ecological consequences.  Although increasingly sophisticated statistical methods are being used in SDM, the vast majority has been developed without considering spatial autocorrelation in the data.  When spatial autocorrelation is ignored and nonspatial statistical methods are used, coefficient estimates are less precise and overall the models can be poorly specified.  Explicitly spatial statistical methods not only can improve upon these model calibration issues, but they also can incorporate information on spatial processes such as competition, dispersal, and disturbance.  Although there has been a recent increase in SDM studies that address explicitly spatial statistical methods, results have been incongruous and difficult to synthesize.  The location- , data-, or scale-specific nature of these studies has impeded efforts to disentangle the effects of spatial structure in the data, sampling strategy, the scale of the study, and statistical methods used.  This project addresses each of these issues specifically with the general research question: how does spatial autocorrelation affect species distribution models?  The research focuses on using multi-resolution simulated distribution maps and novel assessment measures in order to analyze how differences in each of the four issues- spatial structure, sampling strategy, scale, and statistical methods- impact SDM both separately and in concert. <br/><br/>The main outcome of this project will be a framework that can be used to guide all aspects of model conceptualization and development (sampling strategy, statistical method(s) used, and appropriate spatial scale) when using binary data with spatial autocorrelation.  The research will make an important contribution to a greater understanding of how spatial autocorrelation affects inductive models used with binary response data.  Beyond predicting species distributions, these models have become an important and widely used decision-making tool for a variety of biogeographical applications, such as studying the effects of climate change, identifying potential protected areas, determining locations potentially susceptible to invasion, and mapping vector-borne disease spread and risk.  Outside of biogeography, similar binary response models are used in medical/health applications (e.g., diagnostic tests) and to address economic and social science questions (e.g. labor market status, credit scoring, and voting behavior).
0952862	Collaborative Research: Semantics and Pragmatics of Projective Meaning across Languages	BCS	LINGUISTICS	06/15/2010	06/22/2010	David Beaver	TX	University of Texas at Austin	Standard Grant	William J. Badecker	02/28/2013	$104,558.00		dib@mail.utexas.edu	3925 W Braker Lane, Ste 3.11072	Austin	TX	787595316	5124716424	SBE	1311	1311	$0.00	The term projection describes cases where some element of meaning unexpectedly escapes from the scope of another expression, such as a negation or conditional. For example, John didn't see his sister is typically understood as denying that there was an event of John seeing his sister, but not as denying that John has a sister -- even though syntactically the expression his sister is under the scope of the negation. An enormous range of expressions yield projection, including presupposition triggers, conventional implicature triggers, approximatives, and some inferences associated with Gricean implicatures. This project will carry out the first systematic empirical and theoretical analysis of the full range of projective meanings, to establish why projection occurs, and how subclasses of projective meaning differ. To this end, it will develop templates for diagnostic tests that can be used to study properties of projective meanings cross-linguistically, with theoretically naive consultants. The researchers will conduct detailed investigations of projective meanings in English and Paraguayan Guarani, and disseminate the techniques to fieldworkers studying other languages, through publications and workshops. <br/><br/>Modern linguistic semantics centers around Fregean compositionality, the way in which the meanings of parts are combined to give the meanings of larger expressions. While there has been great progress in compositional semantics, projective meaning does not obey ordinary compositional rules. Until now, there has been no uniform account of why projective meanings behave differently from ordinary content. This project seeks to explain projection, based on the working hypothesis that aspects of meaning project if and only if they are not at-issue. The notion of at-issueness is a pragmatic one, based on what questions are under discussion in a discourse. Thus the project will place a relatively little-studied pragmatic notion at the heart of work on linguistic meaning. A first area where the innovations in the project are of broad significance is in its cross-linguistic focus: a theory of human language cannot be based on one language alone, and the project will apply its empirical techniques cross-linguistically. Beyond linguistic semantics, the issues studied are fundamental to Philosophy of Language, since the work subtly redraws the boundary between Semantics and Pragmatics. Further the project is of practical significance in the field of Natural Language Processing (specifically, the subfield of Computational Semantics). Text processing systems, e.g. computer systems for automatically answering a user's questions, must take account of inferences which arise independently of standard composition. A question answering system which does not take account of what is projected will not be able to identify what the user already knows, and will not be able to identify what question needs to be answered.

The design of embedded systems is complicated by their numerous conflicting objectives, e.g., short design time, low price, low power consumption, high performance, and reliability.  Manually designing embedded systems that meet all these goals is an arduous task.  This project targets the automatic analysis, design, and control of embedded systems.<br/><br/>This project is developing optimization algorithms and software that automatically designs low-power, low-price, high-performance embedded systems and integrated circuits.  A fast and accurate profiling and memory access tracing based infrastructure for detailed power and performance analysis of embedded applications and operating systems will be implemented.  The theory for power-aware operating system scheduling and device control will be further developed and the results embodied and made public in a new version of a widely used embedded operating system.<br/><br/>Embedded systems (special-purpose computers) make it easier to communicate, improve the speed and safety of travel, manage information, and assist people with hundreds of other tasks.  This project is making it possible to build better and less expensive embedded systems.  In addition, software developed in this project is publicly released as a reference implementation to improve the battery lifespan of embedded systems that run open-source operating systems.  This project is integrated with Northwestern University courses on embedded system design and real-time systems.  Through it, undergraduate students are benefiting from, and actively participating in, academic research.<br/>

In a first part of the project, we study properties of a single electron in a random medium (weakly disordered Anderson model) in the framework of nonrelativistic Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). In a second part, we address the dynamics of a gas of electrons in a weak random potential (describing materials such as semiconductors), where the interactions between the electrons are modeled in dynamical Hartree-Fock theory.  In a third part of the project, we investigate the Cauchy problem for the Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy, which is a many body mean-field theory describing a gas of interacting Bose particles. We study dynamical properties of solutions of general form, and compare them to dynamical properties as predicted by the nonlinear Schrodinger equation obtained for solutions of factorized type.<br/><br/>Non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics describes electrons, atoms, and molecules moving at ordinary speeds and interacting with the energy quanta of light (photons).  It is the fundamental theory for the description of processes in molecular physics and quantum chemistry.  In this research project, we use the framework of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics to study the motion of an electron in a random medium (e.g., materials including impurities) when exposed to light or lattice vibrations.  Moreover, we study the effect of the interaction between electrons on the dynamics of an electron gas in a random medium.  The analysis of these questions is crucial for the understanding of electric properties of semiconductors.  Another main part of this project investigates the dynamics of systems of many Bose particles, which play a role in the phenomenon of superfluidity.  In this work, we investigate the question of how well the non-relativistic quantum electrodynamic description of a Bose gas matches predictions of other models.

In the proposed funding period, this novel pattern of reactivity will be applied to enyne-mediated propargylation of carbonyl compounds from the alcohol oxidation level.  A feature of these transformations is the ability to achieve carbonyl addition directly from the alcohol oxidation state by exploiting alcohols and conjugated enynes as redox-pairs.  Here, alcohol dehydrogenation drives reductive generation of allenylmetal species and aldehyde electrophiles, which combine to furnish homo-propargyl alcohols.  Unlike classical approaches to carbonyl propargylation, which require carbonyl electrophiles in combination with pre-metallated nucleophiles (e.g. organo-tin or organo-magnesium reagents), the C-C coupling processes employ pi-unsaturated compounds as surrogates to pre-metallated nucleophiles, thus avoiding generation of stoichiometric metallic waste.  Further, through the direct C-C coupling of alcohols, one circumvents discrete redox manipulations otherwise required for pre-generation of aldehyde electrophiles. <br/><br/>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Professor Michael J. Krische of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin.  Professor Krische, who leads the Center for Green Chemistry and Catalysis, is engaged in the development of catalytic C-C bond forming processes that enable sustainable, byproduct-free manufacture of chemical products from abundant, renewable resources.  Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on any area of activity in which the synthesis of organic molecules is needed, such as the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industry, and the biological and chemical research activities.  In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.

These have long been considered the most likely counterexamples to the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare Conjecture. Recent work by Akbulut, and a simpler, more general approach by the PI, have shown that infinitely many of these are standard. The PI plans to extend his method further, trying to show that all CS-spheres are standard. He will also study other homotopy 4-spheres containing fibered 2-knots, accumulating evidence suggesting that the conjecture is true. The project includes various other avenues of research related to the PI's expertise. He will search for compact domains of holomorphy in complex surfaces, using one of his recent theorems. It now suffices to locate smoothly embedded compact 4-manifolds admitting suitable handle decompositions. He hopes to find (or rule out) examples such as pseudoconvex embeddings of preassigned homology spheres, and a compact domain of holomorphy in C^2 homotopy equivalent to the 2-sphere (violating a conjecture of Forstneric). A related theorem of the PI allows one to construct topological embeddings of 3-manifolds with a generalized pseudoconvexity property; he will investigate these in more detail. Another project is to study what manifolds of dimension 4 and higher can be realized as orbit spaces of vector fields in Euclidean space. Preliminary research shows that such manifolds must be simply connected, but many 4-manifolds with nontrivial 2-homology can arise.<br/>Various other investigations, concerning compact 4-manifolds, symplectic structures and Lefschetz pencils will also be pursued.<br/><br/>The Poincare Conjecture for 3-manifolds has now been proved by Perelman, a full century after it was first proposed. Its generalization to higher dimensions was proved in the 1960's except in dimension 4. That last version was proved around 1981 by Freedman. However, the original conjecture was made for topological manifolds, so that one is allowed to crinkle the manifold in complicated ways. When manifolds are used in practice, in geometry, analysis, physics, economics and so on, one normally wants to be able to apply calculus, so one must disallow crinkling and work entirely with smooth manifolds. The smooth analog of the Poincare Conjecture has been understood in dimensions >4 since the 1960's, and is equivalent to the topological version (hence solved) in dimensions <4. However, the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare Conjecture is still mysterious, and is the last fundamental open question remaining from the initial heyday of manifold topology a half-century ago. There have been many potential counterexamples constructed, homotopy 4-spheres that might not be the standard 4-sphere, but none has been shown to actually be nonstandard. It has also been quite difficult to show that any of these examples are standard, but the PI has been in the forefront of research in this direction. His new methods have dispensed with a large family of potential counterexamples that were constructed in the 1970's. He intends to further investigate this problem, adding evidence that the conjecture may be true after all, in spite of the prevailing belief to the contrary in recent decades. He will also study other problems involving 4-manifolds and other classical mathematical objects.

The data obtained from this documentation effort will then be used to produce processed texts and a comprehensive grammar of the language, with an emphasis on community interests of strengthening and revitalization.  The initial stage of the project will focus on collecting already-recorded, but unpublished, texts and making new audio and video recordings of Kuna speech. The purpose is to enrich and complement the existing collection of recordings by adding genres that are not represented currently in the language archives.  Just as importantly, the project will produce several hours of processed texts for community use, through careful transcription, translation and morpheme-by-morpheme glossing of selected recordings.<br/><br/>The project also seeks to train native Kuna speakers in basic linguistic descriptive terminology and documentation methods. The participation of Kuna speakers in the process of documentation, through workshops and seminars, is important because it places value on community input and ensures continual support of the community in strengthening and revitalization efforts. The objectives of the project are lined up with the growing awareness of language and cultural loss among Panamanian-educated Kuna. This has resulted in an interest in rescuing the use of Kuna language and the exercise of cultural practices of dancing and chanting in urban centers. The project can have a lasting impact within the community of Kuna speakers if its members are encouraged to carry out their own documentation projects and share new materials with the community.  The work presented here, therefore, serves as a complement to work already started within the community.

Aiming at generating in-depth knowledge for developing future-generation information technologies using nanoscale phase-change systems, the project is composed of two major parts: (i) exploitation of multi-level phase transition behavior in one-dimensional chalcogenide nanowires, discovering mechanism and technology pathway towards ultra-high-density information processing in future electronic systems, and (ii) investigation of ultimate materials scalability and energy efficiency in binary/ternary chalcogenides with deeply-scaled physical dimensions. Combining multiple Co-PI's different technical expertise, the team plans to build up comprehensive understandings of phase-change phenomena in aggressively scaled materials systems using both experimental and computational approaches with strong support from industry partner. The concept of information technology based of phase-change behavior in materials is recognized as one of the most successful innovations in microelectronics industry in this decade, leading to a prospective main-stream post-silicon technology. If successful, the proposed research would bring in substantial impact in this important technology by generating largely demanded knowledge to break through the well recognized technical barriers: power-efficiency and scalability.<br/>Non-technical: The research opens opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to acquire interdisciplinary research experience in nanoscale sciences, material engineering, nanofabrication, and computational nanotechnology. The efforts broaden participation of under-represented groups in research programs at the two universities. Outreach activities comprise on-site demonstration of nanoscale scientific and engineering techniques for K-12 students in the Tech Valley of upstate New York and the greater Seattle Area. The dissemination of research results by journal publications and presentations at international conferences, and its inclusion in new curriculum development at both universities will ensure broad impacts to scientific, educational, and general public communities.

Relying exclusively<br/>on application designers and developers for such assurances is<br/>unrealistic.  There is a need for methods and tools that can identify<br/>errors in the handing of personal data and provide formal assurances<br/>that personal information is handled appropriately.<br/><br/>This project is developing a software development framework that uses<br/>novel language-based techniques to ensure that software enforces<br/>privacy policies.  Privacy policies (based on legal and regulatory<br/>requirements) are formally specified in temporal logic, and identify<br/>circumstances under which information can be shared (based on criteria<br/>such as the roles of individuals involved, prior events, and whether<br/>the data has been aggregated) and future obligations that are incurred<br/>as a result of the information sharing.  The framework consists of<br/>policy analysis tools, a programming language, program analysis tools<br/>that verify both privacy and declassification policies are enforced,<br/>and a runtime environment.  Used in concert, these components produce<br/>distributed information systems that verifiably handle personal<br/>information appropriately.<br/><br/>The framework being developed by this project will address problems<br/>faced by many information systems.  However, the project will focus<br/>especially on the needs of the medical industry, both with respect to<br/>patient records and clinical trials.  As medical practice transitions<br/>to electronic medical records, the need for high-assurance systems<br/>becomes increasingly acute.  This project will develop the<br/>capabilities needed to verify that electronic medical records<br/>systems comply with applicable privacy policies.

The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.<br/><br/>This award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Jennifer Alexander to work with Dr. Yue Wang at Simon Fraser University in Canada.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this study is to increase our understanding of cognitive processing of speech sounds. Lexical-tone systems use pitch to signal word meaning; they exist in 70% of languages but are under-studied compared to segment (consonant/vowel) systems. The PI and host extend a well-studied model of second-language sound-structure perception (the Perceptual Assimilation Model, cf. Best and Tyler, 2007), which has traditionally focused on segments, to lexical tones. In doing so, they aim to determine the effect of native-language tone experience on perception of novel tone. Their first aim to evaluate whether and how experience with a tone language affects the organization of non-native tones in acoustic-perceptual space. In experiments 1 and 2, listeners use a free classification paradigm (Clopper, 2008) to classify native- and non-native lexical tones. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analyses are used to map and compare native- and non-native tone perceptual spaces. Second, they utilize the non-native tone perceptual spaces to examine how perceptual proximity affects identification of non-native tone categories; experiment 3 tests listeners? abilities to identify non-native tones that differ in perceptual proximity. Listeners are expected to more quickly and accurately identify tones belonging to contrastive categories present in their native inventories. Finally, they investigate how perceptual proximity affects discrimination of non-native tones. Using behavioral and EEG methods, experiments 4 and 5 test our prediction that listeners more quickly and accurately discriminate ? and are more sensitive to differences between ? tones judged to be highly dissimilar, relative to tones judged to be highly similar.<br/><br/>Complete understanding of the organization of linguistic systems, and of how these systems interact, is possible only through thorough investigation of all aspects of language. This study is among the first to extend cross-language speech processing theories to tones. Notably, this study involves listeners from a variety of L1s, toward a thorough view of non-native tone perception. In addition, it is one of the first studies to compare level vs. contour tone processing, and is the first to use EEG to investigate the effect of tonal L1 on the rapidity with which the auditory system detects acoustic differences between tones. A complete understanding of tone systems would aid our ability to expand, test, and modify theories of the world?s linguistic sound systems in general.  Their data will be widely disseminated via scientific conference presentations and publications; the stimuli will be disseminated via a web-based speech archive. Thus, this study will inform and motivate future studies on tone systems. In turn, the knowledge gained from these academic pursuits should benefit various practical pursuits. It should inform approaches for teaching, learning, and communicating in a variety of tone languages, which might then lead to stronger ties with those whose primary language(s) are tonal. For instance, as the global marketplace grows stronger, corporations competing for international business may increase their demand for domestic employees who can easily communicate with tone speakers. Finally, this study will involve comparatively underrepresented subject populations (speakers of Igbo and Yoruba, from Nigeria).

The topics to be investigated are: small viscosity regime of second grade fluids; uniqueness of weak solutions for certain linear perturbations of the two-dimensional Euler equations; the vanishing viscosity limit of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with helical symmetry; the search for hypotheses on the structure of invariant measures or stationary statistical solutions of the two and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with anomalous dissipation; the search for energy cascade for flows in domains with physical boundaries; two-dimensional cascades with large gap bimodal forcing. Turbulence is a common phenomenon in fluid motion, in which macroscopic quantities (velocity, pressure, temperatures, etc.)  no longer have a deterministic relation with global parameters of the flow. Direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows at large Reynolds numbers, that occur in practical applications, such as in geophysical modeling and mixing in industrial processes, are out of reach even for the state-of-the-art computer power. Therefore, there is an urgent need to pursue this challenging problem analytically, by developing rigorous mathematical and statistical tools to investigate it, and to test these tools computationally. <br/><br/>While turbulence is an everyday occurrence, our understanding is still lacking in many aspects. Quantifying the effect of small scales on the dynamics of large scales is fundamental in modern multiscale science. The goal of the project is to enable a predictive analytical study of turbulent flows. This study will impact wide-ranging applications, from geophysical modeling, such as dispersion of pollutants in the ocean, to biological and industrial modeling, such as design of polymeric materials. The project will consolidate the well-established collaborative efforts of the principal investigators with their Brazilian counterparts, and may lead to new collaboration, especially among the junior research personnel. International collaboration among scientists is a key to economic competitiveness in global markets. Four US and three Brazilian academic institutions are involved in the project. The international dimension of the project is further emphasized through two planned workshops. Training and supervision of at least six Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows is also achieved through planned summer schools and scientific workshops. Students and postdoctoral fellows from the US will travel to Brazil to participate in the workshops and the summer schools and interact with the US and Brazilian researchers.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded with the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering.

Using a large skeletal collection from Early Bronze Age (EBA) Bab edh-Dhra' in Jordan as the cornerstone for study, archaeological and geographic information are synthesized in a biocultural reconstruction of ancient life in the early stages of urbanization. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The Bab edh-Dhra' remains are the only sizeable, systematically excavated skeletal collection for the EBA II-III in all of the southern Levant. Over the past eight years of REU funding, researchers have built a dedicated team for studying current questions in anthropology, particularly equipped for training exceptional undergraduates. This program will utilize cutting edge techniques to expand a growing database on topics such as: burned bone, subadult isotope patterns, and 3D nondestructive dental morphology. The three large skeletal collections at Notre Dame, collaboration with other museums, and access to analytical equipment makes this work possible. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: This program will actively seek female and underrepresented minority participation, as well as students at institutions with limited research opportunities. The education of a female graduate student (GTA) and a female post-doc (SRPOC) are enhanced by this program. Exploration of ethical issues related to the politics of archaeology, treatment of artifacts, and repatriation focus attention on scientific ethics, providing an important foundation for future research endeavors. Students engage in original research to develop a suite of methodological skills in the sciences and enhance their capability for collaborative research. They share in a field trip program to laboratories and museums to experience various aspects of interdisciplinary study. Participants receive technical training for data analysis and presentation, and contribute to the project website to enhance the on-line information available to a broad audience. Finally, a dynamic lecture series crystallizes the importance of an holistic approach for studying the past. Previous summer groups have presented their findings at professional meetings and coauthored papers for publication in refereed journals. The proposed biocultural summer program thus provides an intellectually energizing learning experience, which equips participants with a suite of talents for viewing their surroundings. Through the integration of practical research skills, ethical inquiry, and the synthesis of disciplinary paradigms for viewing human interaction, students gain the necessary tools for graduate study where they can contribute in a meaningful fashion to the field of anthropology.

The research will be focused on the analyses of the degradation mechanisms and stability of high temperature electrodes.  The technology can be used to sequestrate carbon dioxide, convert cheap electricity into chemical energy for storage, and provide a flexible device for the conversion between electricity and chemical energy.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be that the technology to be developed can be used to sequester carbon dioxide from power plants and meanwhile convert carbon dioxide and water into carbon monoxide and hydrogen for the production of hydrocarbon fuel.  The technology will also provide a method to store chemical energy using cheap electricity.  The solid oxide electrochemical cell has the potential to be a flexible device operated as either an electrolyzer or fuel cell for the conversion between electricity and chemical fuels.  Compared to existing low-temperature water electrolysis, the high-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cell can achieve high energy conversion efficiency.

The proposed project will build recyclable software blueprints that will be incorporated into a broader platform for learning content, test those blueprints with educators and students, and iterate to generate additional and improved blueprints. The research will significantly enhance a platform that has the potential to disrupt the current paper-based learning content market.  The platform will bring together existing hardware and software approaches in targeting a class of forthcoming tablet-style hardware device that will provide rich tactile interactivity. Educational material will be represented textually, audibly, visually, and kinesthetically, redefining the meaning of interactivity for educational content.  The result will engage students pedagogically using specialized but affordable computer hardware, unlike todays solutions.  Development of the platform has begun with a pilot iPhone application exploring the utility of  rich interactivity for teaching the process of mitosis, with success assessed with higher education partners. The team is uniquely suited to this task, combining experience in high-technology at Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, with business and teaching experience in higher education.<br/><br/>The proposed technology platform will address the markets need for rich educational content having cost-effective scalablility and offers a superior experience to the traditional textbook. It will achieve economic scalability by building using cross- platform technologies like the widely supported HTML5 standard.  It will offer a superior experience to the textbook by deeply incorporating interactivity into the reading experience and by introducing social functions like note sharing.  There is currently no direct competitor to our approach.  Retailers such as Amazon and Barnes & Noble have content distribution platforms, namely Kindle and Nook, targeted to specialized hardware without education-specific functionality. Educational technology players are either too narrowly focused, or do not address customer needs. Existing Creative Commons-licensed learning content can be easily integrated into the proposed platform, which can be enhanced and distributed at very low cost to a socioeconomically broad audience.

Such linkages may operate differently across biogeographic scales because factors known to affect local predator mechanisms also vary with latitude. The mismatch between knowledge of how predators locally affect ecosystem functions and the biogeographic range at which predator-prey interactions occur inhibits understanding of linkages between ecological communities and ecosystems, and thus our ability to manage valuable ecosystem services. Intertidal oyster reefs provide a model system to address this knowledge gap: they occur throughout the mid-Atlantic and Gulf coasts; they contain a similar food-web assemblage across latitudinal gradients in predation, resource supplies, and environmental conditions; they are strongly influenced by predator effects; and they influence sediment and nutrient cycles by enhancing benthic-pelagic coupling. This research involves a series of standardized sampling and experimental studies to: (1) investigate biogeographic patterns in oyster food web structure, resource supplies, environmental conditions, and sediment properties associated with reef function (2) determine how the vital rates of oysters, which can influence benthic-pelagic coupling, vary geographically; and (3) examine experimentally the relative importance of consumptive and non-consumptive predator effects on oyster reef communities and the ecosystem processes they provide and how these effects vary latitudinally. It will provide a mechanistic understanding of the basis for biogeographical shifts in valuable ecosystem services performed by an important marine foundation species, and it will also advance understanding of the interactions between predator effects in food webs and the ecosystem processes that depend on them.<br/><br/>By linking predator effects and benthic-pelagic coupling on oyster reefs in a biogeographic context, this research will provide valuable information to resource managers charged with restoring oyster reefs and recovering ecosystem services. By promoting the exchange of conceptual and methodological ideas among research groups at four major research universities, this project has already and will continue to foster interdisciplinary expertise among its investigators as well as their future graduate and undergraduate students. In addition to mentoring a post-doc, this research will prepare at least three graduate and three undergraduate students for scientific careers by having them independently develop projects related to the project. The investigators are committed to mentoring a diverse group of students across multiple educational levels, and they will continue to disseminate results to the public through lectures, open house events at their respective institutions, as well as radio, newspaper, and television interviews.

Analogous to far-field situations, it is expected that engineered nanostructures can interact with thermally-emitted waves, allowing one to tailor near-field radiation heat transfer rates. This research seeks to identify ways to achieve desirable near-field thermal radiation properties by modifying surfaces using nanostructures. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Experimental and theoretical approaches will be taken to investigate the fundamental physical mechanisms of near-field thermal radiation heat transfer between nanostructured surfaces. Quantitative measurement of the near-field transfer between two parallel plates with or without engineered nanostructures, will be made. A theoretical model will be developed, based on fluctuational electrodynamics, to predict the near-field thermal radiation transfer between such surfaces. The theoretical aspect of the research will improve the fundamental understanding of near-field interactions between thermally emitted electromagnetic waves and nanostructures due to surface plasmon resonance, scattering, diffraction, and photon localization. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Controlling the near-field thermal radiation between nanostructured surfaces may provide a unique opportunity to realize a near-field thermophotovoltaic energy conversion system with high power output. Outcomes of the proposed research will be incorporated into a new graduate course designed to expose engineering students to recent developments in heat transfer research related to nanotechnology and renewable energy. The PI will also conduct K-12 outreach through established programs at the University of Pittsburgh.

Biological systems, including the cell division process which plays a major role in development and cancer, immune response and circadian rhythm (which governs our behavior over the course of a day) are similarly activated across many different species. Indeed, much of the progress in understanding these systems was achieved by studying their behavior in model organisms. When using expression experiments, which measure the level of genes at different time points and in different conditions, to study these systems, researchers often identify hundreds, or even thousands, of genes as being expressed in each of the species. This makes it hard to analyze the resulting sets and to accurately identify genes that control key aspects of the system. In addition, our ability to correctly detect interactions among these genes is greatly reduced since many potential interactions can be used to explain the observed expression values. This joint computational-experimental project will allow us to identify a core set of genes; genes which are conserved in both sequence and expression across multiple species. <br/><br/>These genes represent key components of the biological system, are essential to its proper maintenance and function and would be used for further studies and for initial modeling. Predictions made by our method for these systems will be validated by new biological experiments which will in turn be used to further refine the computational model leading to a computational-experimental loop. As part of the proposal we will also develop an open source software package for cross species expression analysis. We will also develop and offer a new class on the analysis and use of cross species genomics data.

The approach is to study the principles governing the polarization and lattice phonon coupled phenomena at resonance, both by finite element analysis modeling and by conducting a series of carefully designed electrooptic and microwave-photonic experiments on piezoelectric resonators. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merits of the Project: The combined numerical and experimental investigations will reveal the defining parameters of the resonance process that combines contributions of the strain gradient, the local polarization, and the displacement current in a non-centre-symmetrical piezoelectric crystal-resonator. The project will lead to an essential understanding of the nonlinear multi-physics coupling process at resonance and to the development of engineering strategies that capture the substantial potential of the piezoelectric resonance defined electromagnetic interconnecting devices.<br/><br/>Boarder Impacts of the Project: The project is interdisciplinary requiring a broad range of knowledge including solid state physics, material science, and electrical engineering. It thus provides excellent research and education/training opportunities for graduate students. The PIs have been, and will continue to be, active in attracting and mentoring undergraduate students in research. The project will help the development of new graduate courses and strengthens the new PhD program in electronic devices at UTSA that is a Hispanic serving-institute with a fast growing engineering research program and a rich pool of underrepresented minority students.

Bensman	08/31/2015	$665,707.00		chthomas@coas.oregonstate.edu	OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY	Corvallis	OR	973318507	5417374933	GEO	1525	0000, 1045, OTHR	$0.00	Air exchange between forests and the lower atmosphere plays an important role in the transport of heat, moisture, momentum and trace gases between the ground surface and the atmosphere, thereby directly impacting human life and the environment.  Much remains to be learned about the mechanisms of air exchange within the forest canopy layer, and its interaction with the overlying deeper atmospheric boundary layer.  The generally weak nature of subcanopy winds and mechanical barrier presented by the network of tree branches forming the canopy render conceptual frameworks for turbulent transfer (such as commonly applied similarity theories) inadequate.  The common generation of turbulence by shear on a variety of time scales, poor exchange between the subcanopy and above-canopy air, and short-circuiting of the energy cascade are not included in similarity theory that forms the basis for turbulent fluxes in models.  Moreover, ubiquitous background submesoscale motions with spatial scales from tens of meters to several kilometers become important and can lead to unpredictable sudden wind direction changes, intermittent mixing, and non-equilibrium turbulence.  No current physical concept describes the nature of these motions.  Cases of weak airflow in concert with limited vertical mixing can result in high concentrations of contaminants near the surface.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: New field observations will be collected and analyzed at various contrasting sites to generalize findings with the objective to:<br/><br/>i) identify forcing mechanisms of submesoscale motions, <br/>ii) evaluate the impact of plant canopies of different overstory density on the wind, temperature, and humidity fields, and <br/>iii) improve predictors for mixing in plant canopies that incorporate the important physical mechanisms. <br/><br/>These investigations are key steps toward the long-term goal to develop a novel improved framework to describe the flow and resulting transport under weak-wind conditions for a range of overstory density and stratification.  Observations will be made with a unique combination of new and standard techniques, including optical fiber measurement of temperature structure, acoustic remote sensing, ultrasonic anemometers, and laser-illuminated flow visualizations.  The research will be integrated with educational activities in the classroom.  A new graduate-level field course will be developed and taught for students from several disciplines.  Both classroom and field activities will help spark the students' curiosity and interest to better understand interactions between the lower atmosphere and the land surface.  The curricula will be enriched by connecting theoretical concepts with hands-on research experience based on access to state-of-the-art instrumentation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The novel framework and new analysis techniques will lead to improved  formulations of turbulent fluxes applicable in non-ideal boundary layer conditions.  These generalized formulations will be designed for use in regional and large-scale models, as well as dispersion and diffusion models.  A set of practical recommendations will be developed for the applied flux community to reduce uncertainties in scalar budgets and predictions of water availability.  Two graduate students will be trained in theoretical and observational boundary layer meteorology.  This skill set is in high demand and demand likely will grow if/when monitoring of greenhouse gases becomes mandatory.  The hands-on field education will foster critical thinking, improve retention of concepts, and help many students to reach technical proficiency.  One Oregon K-12 high school teacher will be actively involved in field research and data analysis by partnering with the Oregon Natural Resources Education program at Oregon State University.  This teacher's involvement will be leveraged to reach large numbers of K-12 students in addition to the hundreds of students directly connected to the participating teacher.  Shared interests in air movement across the forested landscape will stimulate an exchange of information with the Willamette National Forest personnel.

The social cost of poor or inadequate sanitation is significant.  Disease related to poor water, sanitation, and hygiene is the leading cause of death in children in the developing world and reduces the quality of life and economic opportunities for millions of adults.  Health concerns do not strongly motivate people in poor countries to build latrines at home, however.  Even when latrines are subsidized and built, people do not use them.  There is a critical need to identify and understand the reasons people decide not to build or use latrines, and by contrast, the factors that lead to latrine use and maintenance.  This CAREER award will support research that aims to identify the international policies, socioeconomic factors, and environmental conditions that influence the building and use of latrines in rural India, where an estimated 360 million people live without access to toilets.  Sanitation projects directly depend on land and water resources.  The investigator will collect data on environmental conditions (e.g., access to open land or running water) that support existing practices and their locations.  The research project will explore latrine use and non-use as complicated by social and spatial norms.  The investigator will use an iterative, mixed-method approach, including the use of quantitative methods to link socioeconomic and geographic factors with latrine building at the national scale.  These analyses will inform the selection of four separate sites in rural Indian villages where interviews will be conducted with residents and community leaders.  Systematic analysis of extensive ethnographic data will seek to explain the complex factors influencing the uneven distribution and use of latrines at village and household scales. <br/><br/>This research will generate fundamental insights regarding the factors that influence the use of different forms of sanitation by residents in developing regions.  Through a multi-scalar exploration of the everyday practices of people, this project will advance knowledge about household-scale adoption or rejection of sanitation interventions.  As such, the project may help provide practical solutions to the global sanitation crisis by determining the socio-economic, environmental, and geographic factors that influence the willingness and ability of communities to use latrines.  The project also will provide valuable education and training opportunities for students in the U.S. and India, and it will provide information for public health educational activities in the study areas and elsewhere.

ACE will deploy several 10Gbps waves between Europe and the US, starting with 40 Gbps and growing over the lifetime of the award.<br/><br/>Indiana University (IU), as the lead institution, will function as a cooperative partnership with Delivery of Advanced Network Technology to Europe (DANTE), Trans-European Research and Education Networking Association (TERENA), New York State Education and Research Network (NYSERNet ), and Internet2. DANTE is the operator of the pan-European network G…ANT, which interconnects all of the national R&E networks in Europe, acts as the operating partner in several intercontinental research networking projects across Europe and Asia, and has long provisioned and operated multiple 10Gbps links across the Atlantic to interconnect its European partners with North American networks. NYSERNet is a partner in Manhattan Landing Exchange Point (MAN LAN) and is the optical terminus for many US telecommunications carriers and transatlantic cables. MAN LAN is owned and operated by Internet2 in partnership with NYSERNet and with NOC and engineering services from the IU Global NOC. Internet2 is the leading US research and education networking organization, representing 300 member institutions and connecting thousands of US educational, research, cultural, and related institutions, with partnership agreements with nearly 60 R&E networks around the world. Through cooperative partnership with NYSERNet and the DANET/G…ANT community of more than 34 national R&E networks that will be reachable through these connections, the ACE award will provide the best economies of scale in transatlantic connectivity, supporting a very broad community of users.<br/><br/>One explicit goal of the ACE project is to develop tools and mechanisms to facilitate close operational integration among these network operators. IU and Internet2 have extensive experience in joint software development and deployment centered on the perfSONAR and dynamic circuit networking activities.  As a part of DICE, the ACE project will immediately deploy, expand, and enhance services in security, measurement, identity management, and operational integration in coordination with ongoing DICE activities.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit<br/>As part of the DICE collaboration, the ACE partners will expand and enhance services in security, measurement, identity management, and operational integration. Close cooperation among the DICE participants? efforts will maximize US-EU connectivity, increase collaborations (particularly with respect to security), ensure deployment of accurate and useful measurement technology, deploy dynamic circuit services to meet the needs of high-bandwidth applications, and decrease costs by eliminating duplication of effort.<br/><br/>Broader impact<br/>This project will procure significant additional bandwidth between the US and EU to support a wide range of collaboration between scientists and engineers. In addition, it will support collaboration on technical, operational, and planning exercises that are critical in supporting science and engineering research. Through cooperative partnership with DANTE and the G…ANT community of more than 34 national research and education networks, the ACE project will provide the best economies of scale in transatlantic connectivity, supporting a very broad community of users.<br/><br/>Integrating diversity with research and education is a strong component of the proposal. IU will partner with the existing Gerald L. Bepko Internship Program at IU, which has as its goal of identifying, connecting and working with students in populations under-represented in information technology, to extend educational reach and integrate diversity into the ACE program.

The project promises to reduce the uncertainty in climate prediction associated with the smallest scale physical processes that cannot be explicitly solved by climate models. The project will address three aspects of ocean mixing: near field mixing at internal wave generation sites, mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy transported in the wave field, and far field mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy away from sources. Parameterizations will be based on data-based relations for wave physics, radiation balance theory, and results from process models. In addition to be being based on sound theoretical ideas, the parameterizations will also be based on observational results from the growing data set of microstructure observations.

In ant colonies, for example, individual ants cannot capture rich spatial information from their environment because of their limited sensing ability. Nevertheless, when the ants coordinate their activities within a colony, the group ends up exhibiting better sensing abilities. Using signal processing and communications techniques, the research studies how and why such manifestations of rational and organized behavior arise at the group level from local interactions among agents with limited abilities, what communication topologies enable such behavior, and what type of signal processing enables such formations.  <br/><br/>This research seeks to understand and reverse-engineer the distributed intelligence encountered in socio-economic-biological networks, by investigating relations with learning and rationality over cognitive networks. The latter are adaptive networks that avoid centralized information processing and perform in-network inference and control decisions. Cognitive networks contrast with networks that rely on centralized and parallel information fusion, which are not scalable, are hard to adapt to changing topologies, and suffer from points of vulnerability and information bottlenecks.  The research considers large scale networks of agents and studies how global (rational or irrational) patterns of behavior emerge, including herds, contagions and bubbles in economics. An understanding of how the biotic environment influences collective behavior in animal societies provides a real world guide to good cognitive networks, which can be used in turn to design engineered systems. Cognitive networks have applications in areas ranging from precision agriculture, to environmental monitoring, disaster relief management, and smart spaces.

However, estimates of the composition of Earth's mantle, which comprises more than three-quarters of the Earth's volume and nearly two-thirds of its mass, remain controversial and elusive.  The compositional makeup of this region is especially important for understanding chemical heterogeneity, which constrains deep structure and mixing and is crucial for inferring the thermo-chemical evolution of the Earth, from planet building and the magma ocean, to continental growth and the formation of the oceans and atmosphere.  Investigations of natural rock assemblages that have compositions that include aluminum and calcium in addition to oxygen, silicon, magnesium and iron, have suggested that the upper and lower mantle are chemically distinct and that the transition zone may not only involve a change in mineral structure but may also mark a quasi-compositional boundary.  There are several candidates for the 'natural' bulk Earth composition, and in this CAREER award she seeks to investigate the properties and signatures of these under extreme conditions.  For example, two plausible lower-mantle compositions include one derived from the building blocks of the planet and another derived from parent bodies of ocean island basalts. Investigating the behavior of these compositions at high pressures and temperatures will test hypotheses on Earth's formation, elucidate the geochemistry of the deep mantle, and determine if mantle reservoirs of varying composition are seismologically identifiable. <br/><br/>The proposed mineral physics research uses extreme experimental conditions designed to reproduce and 'probe' the Earth's deep interior, and the exploration of such inaccessible regions is readily disseminated to the public through multimedia and graphical approaches. In particular, the PI proposes a novel way of teaching Earth science through the use of comics, in both printed and digital form.  In doing so, the PI will be able to make topics such as Earth formation and evolution more accessible to students in the New Haven Public Schools System, as well as to the general public through online publication.  Another integral part of this proposal is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in high-pressure mineral physics research through laser-heated diamond-anvil cell experiments at national synchrotron facilities.  This training will contribute to the education of the next generation of independent researchers who will possess a thorough knowledge of high-pressure experiments that impact our understanding of the transfer of mass and energy within our planet.  The proposed research will be carried out at facilities of all scales (PI's laboratory, departmental, national and international laboratories) and results will be disseminated broadly through teaching, community outreach, seminars, conferences and peer-reviewed publications.

Although this membrane forms an important protective barrier, it also comprises a significant barrier to essential cellular components. To overcome this problem, cell membranes contain a broad assortment of proteins that are each specialized to transport specific cargo. These membrane proteins are dynamic molecular machines that undergo conformational change (change in shape and structure) to pick up and release cargo on either side of the membrane. A major challenge to understanding how membrane proteins work is to define these conformational changes. <br/><br/>The CLC proteins are a class of membrane proteins that specifically transport chloride and protons (two small and oppositely-charged ions) in opposite directions. The goal of this project is to understand how the CLC proteins accomplish this feat: specifically, to define the conformational changes by which the protein pick up and drops off each substrate ion with such exquisite specificity. This will be accomplished by positioning small (19F) probes throughout the CLC protein and detecting their motion using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). By combining this information with the static molecular-resolution structure that is known from X-ray crystallography, a dynamic model of CLC protein function will be created.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The experiments described in this research project will involve training a graduate student and a postdoctoral scientist in biochemical and biophysical methods and analysis that will provide excellent preparation for a career in academia or in the biotechnology sector. This research will also involve the training of undergraduate summer students (with continued inclusion of women and minorities), which will serve a twofold purpose of (1) providing research experiences to young, potential future scientists and (2) providing mentoring experience to the graduate student and post-doc who are leading the experiments. <br/><br/>The PI of this project will continue to recruit and mentor women and minorities, to participate in the Biophysical Society's Committee for Professional Opportunities for Women, and to develop mentoring programs for students at Stanford. In addition, she will broaden her role to include outreach to the local schools.

The proposal divides into two main parts: the large scale geometry of groups and the actions of groups on compact manifolds.  Both of these can be viewed as broad generalizations of the celebrated rigidity results of Mostow and Margulis for lattices in Lie groups.  A significant amount of research in geometric group theory is devoted to understanding the large scale geometry of lattices in Lie groups.   In this vein, recent results of Eskin, Fisher, and the PI establish rigidity for certain solvable Lie groups.    The techniques involved are only beginning to be understood, and the PI proposes to develop them further.   In particular the PI hopes to apply these techniques to show the invariance of the solvable radical in more general Lie groups and to the quasi-isometric classification of nilpotent Lie groups.   The second focal point of the proposal is the study of  groups can appear as topological symmetries of compact manifolds.  There has been much work on this problem, but the results almost all apply to specific low dimensional manifolds.  Even for the homeomorphisms of the circle there are many unresolved questions.   The PI proposes studying some classes of higher dimensional manifolds which do have large groups of symmetries on the level of homotopy and to determine whether these symmetries can be realized as groups of homeomorphism.<br/><br/><br/>Roughly speaking, large scale (or coarse) geometry is the study of geometric properties of objects seen from far away. From this perspective, any bounded object is indistinguishable from a point, and a line of dots is indistinguishable from a solid line. This sort of geometry has been influential recently in many areas of mathematics, notably group theory, topology, and geometric analysis. This research will extend previous work of the PI exploring the large scale geometry of several classes of mathematical objects, both classical geometric spaces and objects only now being viewed in a geometric manner.  A particular focus of the proposal is the study of the possible coarse geometries of groups of topological symmetries of relative simple objects built out of familiar spaces, like spheres or other surfaces.

Recent work shows that sexual selection is a ubiquitous process creating new species, yet almost nothing is known about how it creates reproductive isolation at the genomic level. The proposed work focuses on mate choice in species of stickleback fishes. Measures of sexual selection and sexual isolation from field behavioral experiments will be combined with genetic mapping to identify the parts of the genome that underlie male reproductive success and generate isolation between species. Laboratory experiments will evaluate the role of sensory bias for particular colors in generating sexual selection and speciation. <br/><br/>Several of these fish species are endangered due to hybridization following species introductions; this research addresses urgent priorities for the stickleback recovery team and has broad implications for understanding how environmental change threatens endangered species. The educational plan addresses increasing public understanding of evolution through public outreach and training for K-12 teachers. The researchers will develop formal and informal educational materials based on real-world examples of Evolution in Action to enhance public insight into how evolution generates new species. The research will also train graduate and undergraduate students and a postdoc in evolutionary genetics and behavioral research, and in public outreach.

At present, the origin and nature of such defects are poorly understood, as is their impact on device performance. This project will analyze defects in existing and new materials for OPV devices through a variety of experimental techniques, including impedance spectroscopy, carrier transport measurements, and OPV device fabrication and testing. The experimental results will be closely coupled with Monte Carlo computational simulations of charge transport and recombination processes and finite element calculations of OPV device performance. Attempts at mitigating or removing defects from the devices will be carried out through techniques such as pulsed electrical biasing to induce either subtle changes in the local-scale morphology or removal of macroscopic short-circuit defects.<br/><br/>Non-technical:  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. Successful outcome of the project will result in more efficient and robust organic photovoltaic devices that provide an avenue to low cost solar energy utilizing a technology that is easily scaled to large area and high throughput manufacturing. Fundamental progress in the science and engineering of organic photovoltaics can be readily transitioned to application via existing start-up OPV companies that are striving to bring the technology to the point of cost-efficient, large area solar power conversion. Integration of research and education will be emphasized providing students with opportunities and challenges across the fields of physics, chemistry, and engineering, and through the collaborative nature of the project. A female undergraduate student will be working on the project, and it is expected that this experience will accelerate her learning process and help launch her graduate career in applied physics or engineering. Outside the University, the project will reach out to the local Denver community via interaction with the Wings over the Rockies Air & Space Museum. Through an existing close relationship with the museum, the PI and students will build new exhibits at the museum that expose the general population to the science and engineering of solar energy and organic and other photovoltaic technologies. He will also provide curriculum for  summer camps and programs at the museum that reach out to Boy and Girl Scout troops, minorities, and children in at-risk populations.
1033591	Flow Prediction and Fluctuation-sensitivity Investigations for Quasi-steady Shear Driven Condensing Flows in Milli-meter to Micro-meter Scale Two-Phase Systems	CBET	THERMAL TRANSPORT PROCESSES	07/01/2010	09/10/2013	Amitabh Narain	MI	Michigan Technological University	Standard Grant	Ruey-Hung Chen	06/30/2014	$354,947.00		narain@mtu.edu	1400 Townsend Drive	Houghton	MI	499311295	9064871885	ENG	1406	064E, 9251	$0.00	1033591<br/>Narain<br/><br/>This research will aid the development of microscale thermal systems that involve liquid-vapor phase change. To achieve desired system performance, it is often the case that shear-driven quasi-steady condensing flows must be made to behave in a predictable and maintainable fashion. Reliable flow prediction capability is therefore needed for millimeter-to-micrometer scale condensers. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This research seeks to quantify the fluctuation energy transfer mechanisms to and from a condensing flow that might cause significant transient behavior within and outside of a microscale condenser. Experiments involving three different test sections (horizontal gaps or tubes with characteristic dimensions of 200 micrometers to 2 millimeters) in an instrumented flow-loop facility will lead to measured quantitative information on how a small-scale condenser responds - dynamically and thermally - to fluctuation energy transferred through its inlet and outlet. Quantities to be measured include heat transfer coefficients, pressure drops, and other important criteria that are crucial for successful design and operation. The experimental study will be augmented with simulations to generate a predictive capability applicable to a wide array of geometries and various condensing surface temperature conditions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Flow boiling and condensation has promising potential to meet high heat flux needs in many applications. This research will enable a more quantitative prediction of flow and heat transfer in small scale condensers. The research will involve graduate students and undergraduate students recruited from underrepresented groups.
0961163	Collaborative Research: Developing A Prototype Drifter to Measure the Oceanic Geomagnetic Field	OCE	OCEAN TECH & INTERDISC COORDIN	07/01/2010	06/22/2010	Maurice Tivey	MA	Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution	Standard Grant	Kandace S.

They envision a mode of data collection where investigators release a flotilla of inexpensive surface drifters upstream of an area they wish to study with magnetic field data. The drifters pass over the study site, collecting the desired data. These relatively, small, low power and inexpensive magnetic sensors can be obtained and combined or integrated with the circuitry within the drifter. Because the drifter moves slowly, the magnetometer can be set up to read the geomagnetic field infrequently keeping the data rate low.<br/><br/>Magnetic field data from the oceans have been critical for understanding the origin, evolution and structure of the ocean basins. The marine magnetic stripe anomalies not only document Earth?s magnetic field polarity reversals but also form the basis for the Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale and are used to reconstruct the history of the ocean basins. These anomalies are best resolved by sea surface magnetic measurements. Satellite magnetic measurements, while global in extent, lack the lateral resolution to resolve these magnetic stripe anomalies in detail. While we have a working knowledge of most of the ocean basins there are areas, such as the southern ocean, that have only sparse shiptrack coverage. In a recent global compilation for the World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map (WDMAM, Purucker, 2007) the available data was so sparse that a model of magnetic anomalies was used to help interpolate data. Shiptime is expensive and global coverage in remote areas is simply not feasible in the near future. The solution we believe is to use the proven technology of ocean drifters and floats used by the physical oceanographic community and mount small, low power, inexpensive magnetometer sensors to these drifters to cover areas of the ocean that are undersampled at present.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:     <br/><br/>The main broader impact emphasized in the proposal seems mainly the advanced training of a post-doc; and potentially involving a summer undergraduate student. Clearly the ability to collect much-needed geomagnetic data at a fraction of the cost of ship time would have broad impacts in the geosciences community. The proposal will support a female postdoctoral fellow. Data obtained will be used by many other researchers and have a broad impact throughout the tectonics community.

This project will document the effects of the extremely cold winter on Drosophila americana, a fly species native to North America and distributed over a broad latitudinal range. Previous studies of this species reveal polymorphisms in genes and traits that allow persistence in time of extreme temperatures, and these genotypes and phenotypes differentiate the extreme northern and southern populations. This study will assess genotypic and phenotypic variation in southern populations to test whether polymorphisms characteristic of northern populations have a higher prevalence immediately following an extremely cold winter.<br/><br/>Many features of the environment vary predictably in space and time, such as seasonal climate gradients in temperate regions. Organisms adapt to local conditions, yet day-to-day and year-to-year fluctuations occur as a consequence of weather systems. Genetic variation within species may play an important role in buffering populations against these fluctuations. This project will measure the immediate changes in the genetic and adaptive trait composition of populations following an extreme climatic event. The project will contribute to improved understanding of the capacity for genetic variation to buffer against climatic extremes, which is an important aspect of adaptation and persistence of species persistence as global climate and weather change.

Semken, University of Iowa<br/><br/>Abstract. <br/>Excavation of an extraordinary find, a relatively complete adult ice-age giant ground sloth (Megalonyx jeffersonii) associated with two juveniles from the Tarkio Valley in southwest Iowa, is now complete. The recent discovery of a Harlan?s ground sloth (Paramylodon harlani)  metacarpal on a gravel bar immediately downstream from the Tarkio locality added a new dimension to the project: there are two entirely different forms of ground sloth in close stratigraphic proximity of one another. The PI requests funds to undertake an AMS C14 dating of these two distinctly different species (and genera) of ground sloth to verify their ages relative to one another.  Determining the ages of these two different genera of Pleistocene ground sloths is crucial for understanding their paleobiology and paleoecology.  The AMS C14 date is a high risk ? high reward activity in that it is uncertain that its application to long bone medullary cavity materials will be successful; if successful, the new methodology will be transformative for this method.  The University of Iowa Plesitocene research program is extraordinary from the standpoint of its outreach to the lay public, undergraduate and graduate students and will continue as a component of this EAGER proposal.

The researchers have two primary science aims.  First, they propose to explore the forcing mechanisms of the climate change over the past 21,000 years with particular emphasis on abrupt events during the last deglaciation.  Second, they propose to test the fidelity of the CCSM and proxy records against each other for transient climate responses and abrupt climate events. <br/><br/>The project has two guiding science questions: 1) How does the climate system respond to transient climate forcings, and what is the contribution from individual forcing functions such as insolation, atmospheric greenhouse gases, continental ice sheets and meltwater? and 2) What are the mechanisms of the abrupt changes in the Atlantic thermohaline-climate system and the tropical monsoon-ecosystem?<br/><br/>The primary broader impacts involve providing the wider science community with a potentially new perspective on climate reconstructions and providing a strong professional and educational expereince for a post doctoral scholar and a graduate student.

Over the years, the PIs have established a number of fundamental affine isoperimetric inequalities and their analytic counterparts. Newly developed methods (by the PIs and others) will be exploited to attack long-conjectured inequalities. One of the PIs showed how an old notion of p-sum of convex bodies leads to an embryonic p-Brunn-Minkowski theory. The p-inequalities which arise in the new theory turn out to be almost invariably stronger than their classical counterparts.  Recent advances have demonstrated the need to move to the next evolutionary step in the development of the Brunn-Minkowski theory: An Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski theory. Very recently, the PIs have succeeded in discovering the Orlicz analogue of two fundamental operators from the Brunn-Minkowski theory and have established the fundamental affine isoperimetric inequalities for them. The development of an Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski theory will be a main focus of the PIs efforts. Just as the classical Minkowski problem is a central focus of the classical Brunn-Minkowski theory, its p-analogue is central to the p-Brunn-Minkowski theory. The Orlicz versions of this elliptic partial differential equation are a central focus of the Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski theory and a sustained attack on this partial differential equation will be undertaken. The study of projections and intersections of convex bodies is fundamental and of significant practical value. The Brunn-Minkowski theory together with the cosine transform from harmonic analysis are ideal tools for the study of projections. There is a fascinating duality in convex geometry. One of the PIs initiated the study of the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory, which together with Radon transforms are the necessary tools for the study of intersections and to solve long-standing open problems as shown by previous work of one of the PIs and others. Continued development of the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory is proposed. Work of the PIs and others, indicates that there are interesting connections between Information Theory (a subject usually associated with Electrical Engineering) and convex geometric analysis. The PIs will continue their exploration of the interactions between these subjects.<br/><br/>The Brunn-Minkowski theory is the core of convex geometric analysis and is the foundation of subjects such as geometric tomography and stereology. These subjects investigate mathematical problems with strong practical backgrounds such as measuring the diffusion capacity of the lung, determining the volume of minerals in rocks, and detecting tumors in the human body. Numerous applications of the Brunn-Minkowski theory have been discovered in mathematics, science and engineering. For example, the reconstruction of hidden objects from information regarding sections (think CAT scan machines) involves a tomographic analysis.  The proposed work should result in the development of new theories and techniques in convex geometric analysis which are potential new mathematical tools with applications to science and engineering.

Scott	06/30/2014	$270,000.00		cora.lind@utoledo.edu	2801 W Bancroft St., MS 218	TOLEDO	OH	436063390	4195302844	MPS	1762	9161, AMPP	$0.00	TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Non-oxide materials have increasingly attracted the interest of researchers, as many advanced applications in optoelectronics, catalysis, energy and other fields require properties that are difficult or impossible to achieve with oxides. While these materials can be air-sensitive, the improvement in performance offsets the difficulties in handling and protecting the compounds. Metal sulfides have received attention because of their catalytic, electronic and optical properties. Many applications depend on the quality of the sulfide materials. Homogeneity, low oxidation state, glassy structure, or high surface area are often desirable. Traditional solid-state methods require high temperatures to overcome diffusion-related kinetic barriers, restricting products to thermodynamically stable phases, and prohibiting control over grain size or surface area. The growing demand for advanced materials has led to the exploration of a variety of alternative low temperature methods. This proposal introduces a novel low temperature route by extending non-hydrolytic sol-gel (NHSG) chemistry to the synthesis of metal sulfides. The specific objectives of the proposed research are: 1) To gain a thorough understanding of synthetic variable space of non-hydrolytic sol-gel processes for selected binary metal sulfide systems, 2) to explore phase space by NHSG chemistry to discover new binary metal sulfides, and 3) to explore NHSG routes for the synthesis of ternary or quarternary sulfides. Students will be trained in novel low temperature routes, synthesis of air-sensitive materials, and a number of solid-state characterization methods applied to air-sensitive materials. Naturally occurring sulfide mineral crystals will be used in outreach projects to expose the public to basic crystallography, as well as to the importance of sulfides. Solar cell materials or geomarkers like troilite will be used as examples to connect with non-scientists. This research is supported by the NSF Solid-State and Materials Chemistry/Division of Materials Research program.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/> Most metals readily form oxides when heated in air. This has made them the most widely explored class of solids, and resulted in many applications. However, some applications require properties that are difficult or impossible to achieve with oxides, which has spurred interest in the synthesis and characterization of non-oxide materials like metal sulfides. Metal sulfides have found use as catalysts in oil cracking, solid lubricants, solar cells, electrodes in battery materials, light emitting diodes, and many other technologically important fields. Some of these applications require materials with very high purity, controlled oxidation state, crystal structure, and morphology. This proposal will explore a novel synthetic method, which will allow the preparation of metal sulfides at low temperatures, and can offer control over oxidation state, crystal structure, surface area, and the resulting properties of the materials. In addition, it is likely that new metal sulfides with unexplored properties will be obtained by this approach. These materials will be characterized in detail, and their properties may lead to novel applications. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in synthesis and characterization of solid-state materials, with particular emphasis on handling air-sensitive materials. Women and minority students will be actively recruited. Exchange students will work on the project on six month internships, adding to the diversity of the research group. In addition, outreach programs related to naturally occurring sulfide minerals and technologically important sulfides will be designed to give the general public an appreciation for crystallography and materials chemistry, with particular emphasis on the less well known non-oxide materials. This research is supported by the NSF Solid-State and Materials Chemistry/Division of Materials Research program.

SuperMAG is a data collection, processing, and distribution service for ground-based magnetic field perturbation measurements.  It was established by the PI and his team under an existing 3-year NSF grant, AGS-0646323, which expires at the end of April 2010.  Through a worldwide collaboration of organizations and national agencies the facility currently includes data from more than 250 ground-based magnetometers and covers the time span from 1997 through 2001. Via a user friendly website it provides measurements of magnetic field perturbations from all available stations in the same coordinate system, with identical time resolution and a common baseline removal approach.  The service has been publicly available since January 2009. The worldwide distribution of ground-based magnetic field variation measurements has been a backbone of magnetospheric and ionospheric research since the very beginning of the field. It continues to be a valuable resource for a wide range of science investigations, providing one of the few available means of assessing the global dynamics of the Magnetosphere-Ionosphere system and addressing questions of cross-scale coupling. The goal of this project is to further develop the SuperMAG service for the benefits of the science community as well as students, teachers and the general public.  Specifically, the facility will be enhanced in the following ways:  1) Expand the data-holdings to include the years 2002-2010 and 1996; 2) Expand the spatial coverage by including data from a list of new SuperMAG collaborators; 3) Develop additional user-friendly tools for analysis and education and public outreach (EPO).    The proposed effort will build on the existing comprehensive infrastructure to include an additional 10 years of 1-min data from ~250 stations for a total of ~2500 years of validated, rotated and base-lined magnetometer data.<br/><br/>This project being for the operation and further development of a public science data service facility, by design, has strong broader impacts.   Having only been operational for a short time (less than a year on line) it has already attracted a good number of users (more than 100 individual registered users) and shows a steadily increasing trend in usage.  The planned enhancements in data holdings and flexible user specified data products are certain to increase usage even further.   The facility undertakes several initiatives specifically aimed at involving students and teachers at all levels both as users and developers of the service.   The Collaboration with a large and diverse international group of data providers is at the heart of the facility. This collaboration will be further expanded and strengthened through this next installment of the project.

This project uses Mirror Symmetry for K3 surfaces to shed new light on the classification of Fano varieties and on the Kuga-Satake Hodge conjecture. Mirror symmetry, a surprising mathematical duality first predicted by string theorists, often relates complicated algebraic geometry of one space to a much simpler construction involving the K‰hler geometry of the ?mirror? space.  Recent work in progress by the PI with collaborators suggests that most of the known cases of the Kuga-Satake Hodge conjecture admit a re-interpretation in terms of mirror symmetry.  As part of this project, in addition to reinterpreting the known cases of the conjecture, new examples are being developed, with the ultimate goal of providing a general framework for the problem. This work requires deep knowledge of homological mirror symmetry, in which Dr. Katzarkov and members of his research group are experts. It also requires facility with toric varieties, mirror maps, and hypergeometric functions, which are objects of study in the PI's research.  The project also deals with other questions related to mirror symmetry for K3 surfaces, including the use of certain families of K3 surfaces in the classification of Fano threefolds with Picard number one.<br/><br/>The Hodge conjecture is one of the great open problems in algebraic geometry, and indeed in all of mathematics. While the Kuga-Satake Hodge conjecture is a strict sub-problem of the full Hodge conjecture, it is nevertheless of great interest. Similarly, mirror symmetry is developing importance in algebraic geometry; it needs further study but is already leading to fascinating discoveries. Finding a role for mirror symmetry within the Hodge conjecture and classification problems provides a fresh perspective to these imposing areas of research.

The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program.  The research projects focus on research in the chemical and materials sciences with an emphasis on structure determination.  Sample projects include:  (1)  the study of oxidative nucleic acid damage; (2)  the study of ionic liquid and polysaccharide interactions; (3) the powder diffraction studies of negative thermal expansion materials; (4)  the x-ray crystallographic study of persistence factors in Mycobacterium tuberculosis; (5)  the x-ray crystallographic study of the molecular clocks involved in maintaining circadian rhythms ; (6)  the low-resolution scattering studies of protein-DNA complexes; (7) the x-ray and neutron diffraction studies of lipoxygenase complexes; (8) the study of interesting colloidal nanostructures; (9) the x-ray and neutron scattering studies of macromolecules and macromolecular complexes; and (10) the mass spectrometric study of proteins to investigate the evolution of protein structure, conformational dynamics and post-translational modification.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in site visits (e.g. the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory), and a variety of professional development activities. Students will be recruited regionally, and four student positions are being reserved from partner institutions with large populations of students from underrepresented groups.  <br/><br/>Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide practical, hands-on research training in structure determination methods to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity.  The possible projects span a wide range of topics in current chemical and materials research, from investigations of new kinds of materials with technologically-useful properties to studies of the molecular mechanisms of biological processes.  The REU students participating in University of Toledo's REU site will receive excellent training on state-of-the-art equipment in Toledo as well as at some of the country's premier national laboratories.  Students participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.  Many of the student participants will come from groups traditionally underrepresented in the chemical sciences.

In ant colonies, for example, individual ants cannot capture rich spatial information from their environment because of their limited sensing ability. Nevertheless, when the ants coordinate their activities within a colony, the group ends up exhibiting better sensing abilities. Using signal processing and communications techniques, the research studies how and why such manifestations of rational and organized behavior arise at the group level from local interactions among agents with limited abilities, what communication topologies enable such behavior, and what type of signal processing enables such formations.  <br/><br/>This research seeks to understand and reverse-engineer the distributed intelligence encountered in socio-economic-biological networks, by investigating relations with learning and rationality over cognitive networks. The latter are adaptive networks that avoid centralized information processing and perform in-network inference and control decisions. Cognitive networks contrast with networks that rely on centralized and parallel information fusion, which are not scalable, are hard to adapt to changing topologies, and suffer from points of vulnerability and information bottlenecks.  The research considers large scale networks of agents and studies how global (rational or irrational) patterns of behavior emerge, including herds, contagions and bubbles in economics. An understanding of how the biotic environment influences collective behavior in animal societies provides a real world guide to good cognitive networks, which can be used in turn to design engineered systems. Cognitive networks have applications in areas ranging from precision agriculture, to environmental monitoring, disaster relief management, and smart spaces.

The humanitarian challenge following the January 12, 2010 Haiti earthquake provides important lessons that may end up serving as a watershed moment for the field of humanitarian logistics. Quite notably, while some prominent efforts experienced major delays in the distribution of supplies to the people in need, other unheralded operations did so with great efficiency. Understanding the factors that explain degree of success, and assessing the scalability of the successful ones, could open the doors to new paradigms of humanitarian logistics that overcome the kind of challenges that hampered efforts in Haiti. The project seeks answers to such important questions. In doing so, the team would build upon data collected in the first two weeks after the disaster, validate initial findings with additional data, and create the foundation for the integration of findings into models to support relief flows and operations.  The main objectives are to: (1) to identify a preliminary topology, and the basic features of the alternative humanitarian logistic structures that have emerged in Haiti and in areas supporting the effort; (2) to gather insight into their level of effectiveness, positive and negative traits, manpower provided, coverage and extent of their operations, among others; (3) to gather data about the actual flows of critical and non-critical supplies, and their dynamic patterns over time; and (4) to document lessons learned, both positive and negative.<br/><br/>This project would provide the first systemic characterization of the alternative humanitarian logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event. The findings produced by such characterization would: (1) enhance theoretical understandings of organizations and organizing in extreme event environments; and (2) set the stage for advanced modeling of these various approaches. Since improving humanitarian relief operations can reduce human suffering and loss of life in disasters, solving these problems is of national and international import.  Specifically, the project will: (1) promote multidisciplinary collaboration on the humanitarian logistics problem; (2) integrate students to a multidisciplinary and international research process, with a particular emphasis on recruiting underrepresented students; (3) generate findings that will be integrated into disaster and logistics courses; (4) generate findings with applied benefits that will be broadly disseminated to organizations engaged in the practice of humanitarian logistics, including those stakeholders in Haiti.

Lovinger	06/30/2014	$364,000.00	Jayne Garno	een@lsu.edu	202 Himes Hall	Baton Rouge	LA	708032701	2255782760	MPS	1773	7237, 7644, 7969, 9161	$0.00	TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Effective control of nanoscale morphology of organic semiconducting polymer thin films is an important prerequisite for designing more efficient thin-film devices including organic light-emitting and photovoltaic devices.  The current top-down paradigm to such devices is based on utilizing solution-based processing of soluble semiconducting polymers.  This approach generally provides only modest control over nanoscale molecular organization and phase separations.  A potentially transformative alternative to using solutions of pre-synthesized conjugated polymers would be a bottom-up approach to prepare surface-grafted thin films of conjugated polymers by surface-initiated polymerization of small-molecule monomers.  The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a modular, bottom-up strategy to surface-immobilized nanostructured semiconducting polymer thin-film materials with hierarchically controlled molecular organization.  This strategy includes a combination of nanosphere lithographic patterning with surface-initiated in situ polymerization through simple and efficient chemistries.  The project focuses on the following specific aims: (1) studies on nanosphere lithography as a method to prepare nanopatterned immobilized monolayers of semiconducting polymer precursors; (2) development of methods to convert the precursor monolayers into surface-immobilized nanostructured films of semiconducting polymers by using chemical (such as metal-catalyzed living polymerization and/or click chemistry) or electrochemical approaches; (3) applying the outcomes of (1) and (2) to design a bottom-up modular strategy to preparation of bulk heterojunction thin-film solar cells.  Realization of these goals is being done through broad-range fundamental studies on mechanisms and conditions of the surface-initiated polymerization aimed at improving both the molecular parameters of the conjugated polymers and bulk molecular organization in the thin films.  The outcome of these studies may create a new paradigm for design of polymer thin-film materials for organic electronics through the efficient and precise control over molecular structure and nanoscale organization in the polymer films.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Despite the recent advances in the field of organic semiconducting polymers, it is still far from offering a real economically viable alternative to inorganic materials.  This interdisciplinary project will directly impact the national energy security by developing new potentially promising approaches to preparing thin-film organic polymer materials for photovoltaic applications.  This can potentially lead to efficient and reliable organic polymer solar cells.  While this should be seen as a major practical outcome of this project, it is also aimed to contribute to development and fundamental understanding of surface-initiated polymerization, as well as processes of nanoscale organization in complex organic materials.  The students will be trained in organic synthesis, device fabrication techniques, materials and device characterization, and will learn modern theoretical and computational methods.  They will acquire and develop strong multidisciplinary skills and expertise required to be competitive in the current high-tech job market.  Beyond that, students working on this project will be involved in a variety of ongoing broader activities with the goal to improve public awareness and appreciation of modern science and technology and its impact on people's lives, and create interest in science, especially to younger generations.  This will be done through various community outreach programs such as lectures and demonstrations in public schools, with a particular emphasis on underperforming schools.

The newly synthetic field of modern Evolutionary and Ecological Developmental Biology, or Evo-Devo-Eco, is the result. Advances in Evo-Devo-Eco rely heavily on transferring and adapting technologies originally developed for use with traditional laboratory model organisms, in order to apply them to new and emerging model organisms. Presently, insufficient networking often leads laboratories working on non-traditional, yet promising, model organisms, to inefficiently and inadvertently duplicate effort when developing new protocols for use in their systems. Moreover, there is enormous untapped potential for the exchange of techniques, ideas, and knowledge to flow not just from established models to lesser-known systems, but also from the unique biology exposed by lesser-known systems to traditional models. This project will create a new research coordination network called EDEN (Evo-Devo-Eco Network). EDEN will facilitate new support networks and collaborations among laboratories that do not currently enjoy the large community resources of traditional model species. The four major activities of EDEN will be: (1) fostering active interchange of tools and techniques among labs working on emerging model systems; (2) training undergraduates in the field of Evo-Devo-Eco with a focus on emerging model systems; (3) documenting the tools and techniques used and developed in these organisms, and making them publicly available online for future users; and (4) promoting interactions across the Evo-Devo-Eco community through conference funding and the sponsoring of workshops. The advertising strategies and funding priorities of the network are designed to maximize accessibility by participants of underrepresented groups. The gender, ethnic, and career stage diversity of the EDEN core network group will serve as a visibly positive starting point for further increasing the diversity of the next generation of researchers.

0943774	The Organization of Middle Sedentary Period Hohokam Ceramic Production in the Gila River Valley, Arizona	BCS	ARCHAEOLOGY	06/01/2010	06/02/2010	Sunday Eiselt	TX	Southern Methodist University	Standard Grant	John E. Yellen	05/31/2015	$134,636.00	Andrew Darling	seiselt@smu.edu	6425 BOAZ	Dallas	TX	752750302	2147682030	SBE	1391	0000, OTHR	$0.00	With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Sunday Eiselt and Dr. Andrew Darling will undertake a three year study of Hohokam ceramic production along the middle Gila River Valley just south of metropolitan Phoenix in central Arizona. Hundreds of years before the establishment of this city Native Americans had already mastered the art of water management, irrigating the desert with thousands of miles of hand-dug canals.  These inhabitants are known by archaeologists as the Hohokam and their descendants are the O'odham (Pima) who occupy the region today.  <br/>The Hohokam regional system reached its apogee during the middle Sedentary Period from A.D. 1000-1070 when it spanned some 80,000 sq. km of the Sonoran Desert.   Pottery specialists along the middle Gila River supplied this large system with thousands of vessels in return for agricultural products from surrounding groups.   Such large-scale craft production is typically associated with complex societies, with guilds and mass production techniques.   Yet, the Hohokam were relatively egalitarian, with neither cities, nor an extensive division of labor, nor marked social stratification. How, then, in the absence of more complex social systems, was production among the Sedentary Period Hohokam organized to create greater economies of scale?  <br/>The goal of the current study is to test two competing hypotheses related to this question.  The first proposes that multiple communities acted independently to produce ceramics.  More communities were brought into the system, but pottery manufacture was dispersed among multiple villages that traded their products directly to outside consumers.  The second proposes that ceramic manufacturing was highly concentrated in one or a few villages that were supplied with raw materials by other villages.  Both hypotheses may account for high levels of ceramic yield, but the latter implies a greater level of inter-village coordination to create greater economies of scale at the expense of emerging settlement hierarchies.   The competing hypotheses will be tested through geochemical and petrographic examination of raw materials and ceramic artifacts in order to determine how the Hohokam achieved such great economic and production success.  <br/>The intellectual merit of this research rests on the opportunity to explore the relationships of craft production and economic intensification in middle range societies like the Hohokam.   The study will provide critical information on whether enhanced production efficiency precedes (rather than follows from) more complex political developments.  Work will take place on the Gila River Indian Community Reservation under the oversight of their Cultural Resource Management Program.  Collaboration between the Gila River Indian Community and Southern Methodist University broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in archaeology while enhancing the infrastructure for research and education.

Building on our prior research on four occupations, the research proposed here focuses on three of the same occupations -- nurses, nursing assistants, and EMTs (emergency medical technicians)-- with minor attention to the fourth, doctors, who are much less likely to be unionized.  Union contracts and the negotiations surrounding them are a valuable but untapped data source.  Not only are unions players in the process of shaping hours and schedules but more importantly their contracts and negotiations provide a site where we can examine the expression of employer and employee preferences, the arguments and power each deploys, the compromises each makes and the characteristics of each that shape their preferences, arguments, conflicts and compromises.  We hypothesize, first, that these contracts, negotiations, and the conflict they address will often center on issues of time, and, second that both the specific concerns and the resolutions they develop will vary by gender and class. The proposed research will analyze 183 union contracts. We will first examine clauses on hours and schedules in the union contracts.  Standard codes will be developed that apply across all occupations, and cover both broad categories (for example, time off) and detailed sub-categories (for example, holidays, vacations, sick leave, personal time, family leaves).  Using descriptive statistics and multivariate techniques, the study will examine the extent to which these vary across occupations and from one union to another within each occupation.  Next the investigators will conduct interviews with employers and employees about the negotiations surrounding the union contracts, selecting ten sites each for nurses, nursing assistants, and EMTs, and two sites for physicians, in order to understand the concerns and issues that each side identified as most important, which members participate, and the reasons for the compromises they make.  At each site we will interview two union-side contract negotiators and one employer-side negotiator.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The research will have a broad impact both because it advances scientific knowledge and has practical implications for the daily lives of employees and employers.  The research will contribute to social science understanding of organizations and families by rigorously and systematically examining the processes that underlie a set of much-debated outcomes; it does so by examining the points of stress that lead people to collective action.  It makes innovative use of a data source -- union contracts and the negotiations over them -- rarely if ever used to systematically and rigorously examine points of stress.  In practical terms, the proposed research addresses key concerns in employees' daily lives and key challenges faced by employers.  Elucidating the aspects that employers and employees focus on, and finding ways to help reduce the strains they face, could reduce costs, improve organizational outcomes, and give employees more control over their lives at and away from the workplace.

The research project links gene expression, genome methylation, and metabolic rates to assess the mechanisms of environmental adaptation (temperature) across multiple generations in a polar, and closely related temperate, polychaete.   By comparing these two species, the research will assess how a polar environment shapes responses to environmental stress.  This work will produce: 1) a database of full transcriptome (gene specific) profiling data for the polar polychaete cultured at two temperatures; 2) the contribution of genome methylation to the suppression of gene transcription activities; 3) the linkage between shifts in mRNA pools and total cellular activities (as ATP consumption via respiration); 4) an assessment of the inheritance of patterns of gene expression and metabolic activities across three generations; and 5) a simple demographic model of the polar polychaete population dynamics under normal and 'global-warming' temperature scenarios. Broader impacts include two outreach activities.  The first is a mentoring program, where African-American undergraduate students spend 1.5 years working on a research project with a UD faculty member (2 summers plus their senior academic year). The second is a children's display activity at UD?s School of Marine Science Coast Day.

This project involves a collaboration between scientists at the Berkeley Geochronology Center, University of California, University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, and Southern Methodist University. The project?s overarching goal is to determine environmental conditions in terrestrial environments preserved in sedimentary strata of northwestern Texas and southeastern New Mexico, over a brief time interval including the transition between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras, when the greatest mass extinctions known in Earth?s history occurred. A detailed program of paleomagnetism integrated with geochronology (using the 40Ar/39Ar and U/Pb methods) are used to provide a high resolution, regional chronostratigraphic framework. Supported by the chronostratigraphy, a regional model of depositional conditions and environments for the Quartermaster Formation will be developed. Analysis of fossil pollen, where present, will elucidate ecological conditions (and changes) across the time interval spanning the extinction horizon. Isotopes of oxygen and carbon are used to quantify atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and surface air temperatures. The results will help clarify the environmental tolerances of the Earth system, and aid understanding of the causes of the most profound biotic catastrophe known in our planet?s history. As participants in field and laboratory components of the research, undergraduate and graduate students at the participating institutions will receive hands-on training in the diverse scientific disciplines employed in the project. <br/> <br/> <br/>
1011476	DOCTORAL DISSERTATION: Evolution of neural circuits underlying species-specific swimming behaviors in opisthobranch molluscs	IOS	ANIMAL BEHAVIOR	07/01/2010	06/23/2010	Paul Katz	GA	Georgia State University Research Foundation, Inc.

This project, which is part of a doctoral dissertation, uses the nervous systems of sea slugs (opithobranch molluscs) to address this issue by comparing neural circuits underlying swimming behavior.  Sea slugs have large neurons and simple nervous systems, allowing researchers to map out neural circuitry underlying equally simple behaviors.  Some sea slug species swim by flexing their bodies up and down. Other species either do not swim or swim by other means. The neural circuitry underlying up and down swimming has been determined in two species: Tritonia diomedea and Pleurobranchaea californica.  The neural circuits and interactions underlying swimming in these two species are remarkably similar even though these animals are not closely related.  There is evidence to suggest the ability to swim evolved independently using the same (or homologous) neurons.  This leads to the prediction that other species that swim in this manner would also use the same neurons and neural interactions to produce the behavior.  To test this intriguing prediction, a third species of sea slug that swims with up and down movements will be be studied.  The only readily available species are found in Australia.  Electrophysiological, pharmacological, and histological approaches will be employed by the student to study the Australian species to determine if it also uses the same neurons and neural mechanisms.  The results of this project will contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms that allowed behavior to evolve.  A positive result would show that behavior could predict neural circuitry in animals that independently evolved the behavior.  A negative result would still be interesting because it would show that similar behaviors can be produced by different mechanisms.<br/><br/>There are several broader impacts of this project.  The first is that it will be a training opportunity for the student that will greatly enhance his dissertation project.  The work will also establish a new partnership with colleagues internationally.  The results of this project will be disseminated broadly both in the form of research papers, but also as contributions to NeuronBank.org, a project that tracks identified neurons and synaptic connections.
1033256	Noninvasive Ultrasonic Pressure Estimation using subharmonic response of Contrast Microbubbles	CBET	PARTICULATE &MULTIPHASE PROCES	07/01/2010	09/24/2012	Anette Karlsson	DE	University of Delaware	Continuing grant	William Olbricht	06/30/2013	$299,986.00	Kausik Sarkar	a.karlsson@csuohio.edu	210 Hullihen Hall	Newark	DE	197162553	3028312136	ENG	1415	058E	$0.00	Encapsulated microbubbles are used as a contrast enhancing agent for diagnostic ultrasound. This proposal is predicated on the use of subharmonic signal (signal at frequency lower than that of the exciting ultrasound pulse) from these microbubbles to noninvasively quantify and monitor the ambient blood pressure in an organ. Local ambient blood pressure provides important information regarding the functional integrity of many organs, and it can be used to diagnose and monitor many diseases such as defective heart valves, malignant tumors and portal hypertension. We propose to use in vitro experiments, modeling, perturbative analysis and numerical simulation to investigate the dynamics of contrast microbubbles with a view to understand and optimize such applications.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/><br/>Even though contrast microbubbles have been widely studied by clinicians, and two of them (Definity and Optison) are currently approved for echocardiography by FDA, we lack a fundamental understanding of their behavior. Specifically, their nonlinear oscillations at higher acoustic pressures resulting in significant emissions in sub and super harmonic frequencies need to be understood before optimized nonlinear imaging modalities can be designed. Our collaborators at Thomas Jefferson have proposed a Subharmonic Aided Pressure Estimation (SHAPE) technique which relies on sensitive dependence of subharmonic signals on ambient pressure. However, currently there are conflicting experimental observations as to whether subharmonic response increases or decreases with ambient pressure. There is a need to understand the nonlinear dynamics why we see subharmonics, how they are affected by the encapsulation, do they increase or decrease with different parameters and why? We propose to answer these questions. We will collaborate with Professor Flemming Forsberg of Thomas Jefferson Medical College and Hospital for the clinical realization of the pressure estimation. Our experimental investigation will involve commercial contrast agents, as well as experimental agents prepared by Professor Margaret Wheatley at Drexel University.<br/><br/>The specific aims of this proposal are:<br/><br/>1. Characterize encapsulation with nonlinear interfacial rheological model: Develop nonlinear rheological models for the encapsulation of contrast microbubbles, and use acoustic experiments to determine characteristic parameters for commercial and experimental contrast microbubbles.<br/><br/>2. Investigate nonlinear response from contrast microbubbles. Develop an experimental setup to measure scattered response from microbubbles under varying overpressure. Measure scattered response from different microbubbles varying operating parameters (dilution, amplitude, frequency, pulse repetition frequency and over pressure). Compare experiments with models. Investigate effects of shape oscillation on scattered signal. Develop a theory of subharmonic response of encapsulated microbubbles.<br/><br/>3. Optimum operation: Determine optimum material properties of contrast microbubbles and optimum excitation for subharmonic estimation of pressure, in clinical collaboration with Thomas Jefferson.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/><br/>Although ultrasound remains the safest means of imaging, its utility is limited by poor contrast 20% of the 20 million echocardiographies performed each year in the United States do not provide definitive diagnosis for coronary heart disease. A good contrast agent can measurably improve ultrasound imaging. Understanding nonlinear response of a contrast microbubble is crucial to accurate nonlinear contrast imaging modalities. Educationally, the proposed research will train ME students at the cross-disciplinary interface of mechanics, biology and medicine. The PI is committed to graduate and undergraduate education. This proposal will support two PhD students (Katiyar and Paul: see PI?s Bio). PI is actively involved in UD?s outreach activities giving twice a year lecture demonstration of his lab to the general public visiting the university. He regularly employs undergraduate (recently three female) interns in his lab. PI has established a link with a collaborator in Morgan State University (an HBCU) to give yearly research presentation to recruit undergraduate research interns who will be trained to subsequently pursue graduate study at UD.

One class of these receptors (the Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor-like kinases or LRR RLKs) is present in a large family of 223 members in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These receptors have a structural organization similar to that of animal receptor kinases, and several that have been studied in detail are known to be critical elements that regulate the plant's growth, morphogenesis, disease resistance, and responses to stress. However, the functions of the vast majority of this large family of signal transduction molecules remain unknown. With previous support from the NSF Arabidopsis 2010 Program, the investigators have generated a set of genetic and biochemical resources that will allow the in-depth study of the function of LRR RLKs in plant growth and stress responses. Using proteomic and mass spectrometry approaches, this project is designed to define the proteins that interact with these LRR RLKs. These proteins form an interactive network whose function ultimately determines a range of physiological responses, and this project will define the components and properties of this network. In addition to this broad study of protein network interactions, a selected group of LRR-RLKs will be characterized at a detailed biochemical level, including functional analyses that will permit an understanding of how these proteins influence plant growth.<br/><br/>Broader Impact of the Research: <br/>Given the known importance of the LRR RLK family to plant development, the results of this project are likely to have practical agricultural impact. In addition this project will provide extensive resources to the Arabidopsis research community including a database (http://www4.ncsu.edu/~sclouse/Clouse2010.htm) that creates a unique resource for the comparative study of LRR RLK protein networks and phosphorylation sites. The highly successful NSF-supported Plant Phosphorylation Workshop will be reinitiated and will serve as a forum for researchers from as many as 45 laboratories to interact and share research ideas and results. The project will also provide training in protein biochemistry, mass spectrometry, and Arabidopsis molecular genetics at all levels from high school student interns through postdoctoral scientists. Recruitment of these individuals will be integrated with established programs at North Carolina State University and the University of Illinois that encourage the participation of under-represented minorities in scientific research.

The two campaigns will image with unprecedented resolution the New Madrid Seismic Zone active fault system and a series of inferred faults suspected to be responsible for earthquake induced liquefaction features predating the seismic activity of the New Madrid Seismic Zone. Exploiting the advantages of marine acquisition (time effective, low cost), the new data will identify the location and timing of deformation within the active fault system (which generates more than 200 magnitude 1.5-4.0 earthquakes a year), and outside the New Madrid Seismic Zone, and contribute to the understanding of how long-term deformation is partitioned in time and space among faults within the Mississippi Embayment. This information is critical to solve the apparent paradox raised by the contrasting evidence of small geodetic vectors, a puzzling lack of substantial deformation, and the high level of instrumental and historical seismicity. <br/><br/>One of the pillars of plate tectonics is the assumption of the rigidity of major plates. Indeed GPS studies show that most plate interiors behave rigidly and, as a result, the majority of earthquakes occur along narrow or diffuse belts at plate boundaries. Located in the heart of the North American continent and 2,000 km away from the nearest plate boundary, the New Madrid Seismic Zone is one of the most active intraplate seismic areas in the world, and one of the most notorious deviations from plate rigidity. Paleoseismological observations show that the area experienced a series of catastrophic earthquakes in historic and prehistoric time and evidence is mounting that the long-term seismicity is not limited to the presently active fault system, but that large earthquakes have occurred in other areas within the Mississippi Embayment, for which the responsible fault (or system of faults) are yet to be identified. This study will provide observational constraints on theoretical models proposed to explain the timing, magnitude and location of intraplate seismicity in the Central United States. The results of this project will also have a crucial impact for earthquake hazard assessments by localizing and characterizing seismogenic faults, and improving the quality and usefulness of seismic hazard maps.

Recent work on global competition suggests that successful organizations foster collaboration across departmental, firm, and national boundaries.  Research in organization theory, strategy, and sociology recognizes the importance of social combinations to innovation, entrepreneurship, and firm competitiveness, but we know little about the social processes and interpersonal skills underlying the creation of such combinations and how they are fostered on the ground.  <br/><br/>Three key questions will be explored: 1) How do social networks, individual knowledge, and resources combine and lead to organizational innovation?  2) To what extent does participation in innovation also lead to promotion within a firm? 3) How do these relations vary within and across different firms?   Ethnography, comparative case studies, and a two-stage social network study will be used in multiple organizations differing in size and product/service offering to answer these questions.  Research findings will advance organization theory.  They will also practices which managers can use to foster innovation and that professionals and scientists can apply to enhance their own performance.<br/><br/> <br/>

This research project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program of the Division of Materials Research (DMR), is to study how organic molecules interact in the solid state so as to learn and build up the fundamental understanding that will lead to viable solutions for crystal structure prediction.  In particular, the locality of intermolecular interactions, both strength and directionality, in organic crystals will be investigated within the framework of conceptual density functional theory by utilizing such concepts as softness, Fukui function, and crystallization force.  Through calculation and analysis of electronic structures of molecules and their respective crystal structures, the project will seek and establish the underlying, inherent linkage between a molecule's structure and its interacting characteristics with other molecules in crystals.  The influence of a molecule's conformation on its intermolecular spatial arrangement is further studied by electronic calculations and crystallization experiments.  Upon successful completion of this research project, a methodological framework will be built for advancing into practical tools to understand crystallization and to predict crystal structures of organic compounds.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Fascination of organic crystals lies in the infinite periodicity and intriguing complexity in the three-dimensional structure that is interweaved by weak forces.  Despite years of vigorous studies, the scientific efforts to predict crystal structures have proved to be primitive, powerless in most cases, and in the end, futile.  This research project aims at bringing advanced computational methods into the field and developing novel approaches for predicting crystal structures that are built upon ingenious ways of analyzing electronic structures of molecules and crystals.  Moreover, the research will shed light on fundamental mechanisms of crystal growth and offer insights for designing new materials including pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and nonlinear optical materials.  The project will serve as an excellent educational platform for undergraduate and graduate students to master their problem-solving skills and become future leaders in the area of organic materials.

Interpreting the observations and advancing this new field will require accurate theoretical predictions for the wave signal from a given source. This project will make use of a method known as Direct Integration of the Relaxed Einstein Equations (DIRE), that has been developed by the PI and his students at Washington University, which solves Einstein's equations systematically in a procedure known as the post-Newtonian approximation (appropriate for systems where the velocities are small compared to the speed of light). Using this method, it will be possible to study the detailed motion and radiation from the inspiral of compact binary systems (double star systems containing neutron stars or black holes) to a high degree of accuracy. Post-Newtonian methods will also be used to study unusual aspects of the curved spacetime surrounding rotating black holes, related to the existence of the so-called Carter constant of the motion, and to calculate the recoil velocity experienced by black holes formed from compact binary merger.  Ways to use gravitational-wave data to test alternative theories of gravity in new regimes and to measure astrophysical and cosmological parameters will also be studied.   In particular, a detailed analysis of gravitational radiation from compact binary inspiral in a class of scalar-tensor alternatives to general relativity will be carried out, together with a study of data analysis strategies for placing the best possible bound on this class of theories.  The possibility of testing general relativity in the strong-field vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of our galaxy using future adaptive optics infrared interferometry will be analyzed by studying orbital perturbations of stars in close orbits near the hole caused by other stars in the central region, by a possible distribution of dark matter, and by tidal distortions of the stars.  This will involve a mixture of analytical post-Newtonian calculations and numerical N- body simulations.<br/><br/>The work on equations of motion, gravitational waveforms and analysis of gravitational-wave data will impact the emerging field of gravitational-wave astronomy.  The work on recoil velocities may contribute important insights that could impact astrophysical modeling of the growth of massive black holes in galaxies, as well as the interface between post-Newtonian theory and numerical relativity.  The work on testing general relativity near the galactic center black hole could impact the development of advanced instrumentation for observational infrared astronomy.  Education and training of students will be integrated into the research program.

They envision a mode of data collection where investigators release a flotilla of inexpensive surface drifters upstream of an area they wish to study with magnetic field data. The drifters pass over the study site, collecting the desired data. These relatively, small, low power and inexpensive magnetic sensors can be obtained and combined or integrated with the circuitry within the drifter. Because the drifter moves slowly, the magnetometer can be set up to read the geomagnetic field infrequently keeping the data rate low.<br/><br/>Magnetic field data from the oceans have been critical for understanding the origin, evolution and structure of the ocean basins. The marine magnetic stripe anomalies not only document Earth?s magnetic field polarity reversals but also form the basis for the Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale and are used to reconstruct the history of the ocean basins. These anomalies are best resolved by sea surface magnetic measurements. Satellite magnetic measurements, while global in extent, lack the lateral resolution to resolve these magnetic stripe anomalies in detail. While we have a working knowledge of most of the ocean basins there are areas, such as the southern ocean, that have only sparse shiptrack coverage. In a recent global compilation for the World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map (WDMAM, Purucker, 2007) the available data was so sparse that a model of magnetic anomalies was used to help interpolate data. Shiptime is expensive and global coverage in remote areas is simply not feasible in the near future. The solution we believe is to use the proven technology of ocean drifters and floats used by the physical oceanographic community and mount small, low power, inexpensive magnetometer sensors to these drifters to cover areas of the ocean that are undersampled at present.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:     <br/><br/>The main broader impact emphasized in the proposal seems mainly the advanced training of a post-doc; and potentially involving a summer undergraduate student. Clearly the ability to collect much-needed geomagnetic data at a fraction of the cost of ship time would have broad impacts in the geosciences community. The proposal will support a female postdoctoral fellow. Data obtained will be used by many other researchers and have a broad impact throughout the tectonics community.
0952816	CAREER: Political Economy and Policy with Imperfect Information	SES	ECONOMICS	06/01/2010	08/20/2012	Manuel Amador	CA	Stanford University	Continuing grant	Georgia Kosmopoulou	08/31/2014	$321,670.00		amador.manuel@gmail.com	3160 Porter Drive	Palo Alto	CA	943041212	6507232300	SBE	1320	1045, 1187, 9178, SMET	$0.00	This research has three projects. The first studies a novel model of political economy for a small open economy. The model incorporates a main political friction (disagreement about the timing of expenditures) together with lack of commitment to tax policy or debt repayment. It is a parsimonious modification to the standard small open economy model and delivers rich dynamics driven mainly by the political economy friction. The model is thus capable of generating new and interesting predictions regarding the behavior of debt, growth and political institutions. Several important theoretical extensions and an analysis of the role of policies such as debt relief and aid are planned for future work. The second project relates to the design of optimal policy under private information. This project will extend previous economic techniques to be able to solve policy design questions when the policy maker has biased preferences but posses valuable private information. I will analyze two particular cases: (i) the optimality of budget-balance rules for fiscal authorities, and (ii) the optimality of tariff caps in trade agreements. Finally, the third project will use a recently developed macroeconomic model of information and monetary policy, to study the question of optimal public communication by a Central Bank.  <br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/><br/>The research project contributes to the economic growth literature by introducing political economy considerations into the basic toolkit of macroeconomists. It also deals with more specific policy questions that have been at the top of the agenda of several international organizations. For example, there is a large discussion regarding the role of debt relief to emerging markets, as well as an ongoing debate on the benefits (if any) of foreign aid to poor nations. The research will provide a modern framework to analyze the role of such policies. The project on balanced budget rules has important implications for policy, not only for emerging markets but also in the developed world. The project on optimal tariff rules has implications for how negotiations in GATT/WTO can be improved to benefit all parties involved.

Microorganisms have been a potentially important part of sulfur cycling for billions of years (Johnston et al., 2005; Mojzsis et al, 2007), yet many of the fundamental interactions between microorganisms and elemental sulfur are not understood. Advancing our understanding of how these systems behave requires delving into the detailed interactions between cells (bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic), minerals (especially nanoparticles), and water chemistry (especially redox speciation).<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Elemental sulfur occurs as bulk and nanoparticulate phases and can be utilized by microorganisms for all 3 major catabolic paths through use as an electron acceptor, donor, or essentially both in the case of disproportionation. Dissolved sulfur species also interact with elemental sulfur, and those species can additionally react with metals, most importantly iron. Microorganisms must solubilize elemental sulfur in order to metabolize it, but this mineral is fundamentally different from other minerals where microbe-mineral interactions have been well studied, such as iron oxide minerals (for example Hernandez and Newman, 2001; Childers et al., 2002; Burgon et al., 2003; Lovley, 2008; Newman, 2008). Solubilizing elemental sulfur can be accomplished through interaction with organic ligands or through interactions with other sulfur species to form new soluble intermediates such as polysulfides. Investigator proposes to develop a combined in situ analytical capability to investigate sulfur speciation and elemental sulfur mineralogy in field and laboratory tests to address the following hypothesis: The size and surface character of elemental sulfur is a key component controlling sulfur cycling in biotic and abiotic reactions in many environments.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Advances in fundamental cell-mineral-redox interactions in the sulfur system provide an opportunity to integrate some exciting educational experiences to engage stakeholders and professionals in health, policy, and legal fields with research goals that will yield transformative insights of value to the broad study of sulfur-based microorganisms and element cycling through time and in environmentally relevant systems. Sulfur species and minerals are importantly affected by a number of known organisms, but the level of detail proposed for elemental sulfur particle size/character and redox speciation has never been applied. When comparing the wealth of information that has come from years of investigating detailed iron oxide-microbe interactions (Newman, 2008), a detailed investigation of fundamental microbe-mineral-redox interactions involving sulfur may yield critical new insights. The application of the knowledge gained through these investigations of the sulfur system can be applied to broader thinking about similar cell-mineral-redox interactions that affect problems of human health. This opens an opportunity to advance the training of scientists to communicate results with the non-scientific public, and provide training to the medical professionals, policymakers, and legal professionals that utilize mineralogical, geochemical, and microbial information in addressing problems such as asbestos mineral exposure, groundwater arsenic contamination, and selenium toxicity. A series of classes and professional workshops will be developed, alongside a series of learning modules illustrating fundamental cell-mineral-redox interactions, to engage students and professionals in hands-on experiences of how geochemical, mineralogical, and microbial data is gathered, assessed, evaluated, and debated to arrive at reliable information. The participation of stakeholders in the practice of scientific data collection, evaluation, and debate integrated with the training of scientists with better communication skills represents not only an advance in the preparation of scientists, but an advance also in preparing professionals who will work with those scientists.

The project involves extensive collaboration between Dr. Haiyan Wang from Texas A & M University (TAMU) and Dr. Judith Driscoll from the University of Cambridge (UCAM). Funding for the latter is provided by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in the UK.  The broader impact of the research is: 1) junior researchers are involved in international multidisciplinary training and are gaining complementary research experience at both universities and at Los Alamos National Laboratory; 2) the materials science and engineering curricula at both universities is being enhanced; and 3) the results are being disseminated to a much broader audience through the summer research program for high school teachers at TAMU, the Woman Engineer Forum and the Woman Mentor Program at TAMU, the Summer School Program at the University of New Mexico (a Hispanic-Serving Institution), Annual Girls School Association events and the Cambridge Science Festival at UCAM.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project is concerned with studying VSCN films that can give better physical properties compared to single layer or multilayer films. Basic scientific research is focused on understanding the limitations to strain, interface compatibilities, and lateral ordering. New systems are being grown and explored to demonstrate the power of the VSCN method, and finally demonstrations of the functional applicability of the strongly enhanced VSCN systems are being carried out. Various characterization techniques, such as high resolution XRD and TEM (combined with STEM and EELS), as well as physical property measurements are being utilized to investigate the structure-property relationships of VSCN films.

They also represent a significant natural hazard. This project is concerned with fundamental questions regarding eruptive systems: Why do some silicic magmas erupt while others stall in the subsurface? Why do some magmas erupt effusively (i.e. as lava flows) while others do so explosively? Are these different magmas that are predestined to different eruptive potential and style, or are they similar magmas subject to different contingencies? Much attention has been given to the importance of external triggers (e.g. earthquakes) in initiating eruptions. Many lines of evidence suggest, however, that eruption triggers are only effective to the extent that a magma body is already primed to the point where eruption is already very likely or inevitable. The fundamental question that this project aims to address is what is the path for priming of a magmatic body? The project will explore the importance of the internal evolution (i.e. crystallization, bubble formation, and magma evolution) of silicic magmas to eruptive potential, and in particular, to explosive potential. A combination of thermodynamic and fluid dynamics modeling will be employed, using selected natural systems as inspiration and guides to exploring the parameter space of the models. While the research being conducted is academic in nature, it will help further the understanding of the eruptive potential of magmatic systems, and may eventually help volcanologists concerned with systems that directly affect society.<br/><br/>As part of this project, a thermodynamic model that can appropriately describe the evolution of high-silica systems will be developed, and it will be coupled with new and existing models of the dynamics of the chamber itself and of its walls. Modeling tools developed under this project will be made available to the scientific community as standalone software, web services, and browser-based web clients that will permit users to apply these tools to their own scientific questions and teaching needs. Natural systems to be studied include the Bishop Tuff (CA), Peach Spring Tuff (AZ-NV-CA), and the Highland Range Volcanics (NV), taking advantage of their unique magmatic and eruptive histories to assess some of the first order controls on the eruptive potential of silicic magmas.

Castellano for the investigation of both heterogeneous and homogeneous approaches to photocatalytic hydrogen production from water.  The effort targets the photochemical preparation, characterization, and photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide (TiO2) materials decorated with highly dispersed metallic platinum and palladium nanoparticles.  Photocatalysis is evaluated in aqueous solutions using bandgap excitation in the presence of hole scavengers and in the analogous visible-light sensitized materials using select surface bound ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) complexes in the presence of appropriate sacrificial electron donors.  Various cobalt compounds are tested for their hydrogen-producing ability in concert with charged TiO2 in aqueous solutions.  Homogeneous photocatalysis schemes exploit reductive quenching pathways that have recently led to significant enhancements in catalytic turnovers.  The use of alternative sacrificial electron donors in these homogeneous schemes has led to unprecedented catalytic turnovers while greatly expanding the inventory of potentially useful sensitizers. <br/><br/>This project addresses interdisciplinary research that contributes to the fundamental knowledge base of converting solar light to an environmentally-friendly, non-carbon based, combustible chemical fuel.  The photocatalytic systems considered in this research project offer better atom economies and the potential for much higher efficiencies than other systems.  The project fosters the scientific and professional education of undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral associates and visiting scientists.  Professor Castellano participates in various K-12 STEM education efforts including the Imagination Station of Toledo and the annual High School Science Days that take place on the Bowling Green campus.

The approach toward more in-depth understanding and control of exciton dynamics is through their interactions with activating impurities and lattice defects. Lattice defects in the YAG structure will be characterized using positron lifetime spectrometry through a comprehensive study of their types, sizes and concentrations. Positron parameters will be correlated with optical measurements of exciton behavior, photon emission, and scintillation properties. The correlation between positron parameters and optical properties will be monitored as a function of growth conditions, choice of rare-earth dopant, doping levels, deviations from stoichiometry and postgrowth treatments. The correlation will further be examined following processing steps that include thermal annealing under different atmospheres. Results of the characterizations will be used to modify synthesis and growth conditions in order to improve optical properties. <br/><br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. Through greater understanding of the interactions of excitons with defects this research is expected to lead to significant improvements in scintillator performance. Scintillator materials convert various types of radiation into photons, which can then be collected and analyzed. Two important application areas are medical diagnostics, and gamma and neutron radiation detection. The relationship between crystalline defects and scintillator performance is an important topic and at the present time not well understood. The results of these studies will help to understand how to improve scintillator efficiency by leading to the design of improved scintillator compositions and structure. The research will enhance understanding of defect formation in ionic crystals and selection of improved methods of synthesis/processing for superior optical properties. The project will integrate research and education of undergraduate and graduate student participants. Training will be in a multi-disciplinary environment of basic and applied physics, materials science, electronics and photonics. In addition to providing support and mentoring of graduate students, the PIs will motivate undergraduate and high school students through a web site and make presentations to students on and off campus. The PIs will create a diverse research group that includes women and minority group members. Research results will be disseminated through publications in premier journals and via presentations at conferences and in seminars.

Experiments and some theoretical work reveals structure in the scl spectrum of a free group analogous to the volume spectrum in hyperbolic 3-manifold topology, together with a partial explanation in terms of surgery, and connections to the theory of higher-dimensional continued fractions, enumerative combinatorics, phase locking for coupled nonlinear oscillators, and the thermodynamics of DNA. Other theoretical work reveals an abstract rigidity implicit in the polyhedral structure of the scl norm, which manifests itself in rigidity for symplectic representations of surface groups, and dynamical rigidity of Ruelle invariants and their generalizations for certain groups of symplectomorphisms. The PI will atempt to unify and explain these phenomena, and to give them a rigorous justification.<br/><br/>For more than two thousand years, geometry has been defined and studied in 1-dimensional terms: to measure the distance between two points, find the shortest line (i.e. the smallest 1-dimensional object) that goes from one to the other. Since the 16th century, mathematicians have understood that the 1-dimensional real numbers are just a shadow of the 2-dimensional complex numbers. Recently, geometry has been complexified in a similar way, and mathematicians explore different aspects of the geometry of a space by probing it with 2-dimensional surfaces. Such a surface could be a soap bubble with boundary on a wire frame, or an interface between turbulent and non-turbulent flow, or an imaginary surface interpolating between strands of DNA. The PI will study the surfaces that solve extremal geometric problems (in many senses of the word) using tools from - and in order to solve problems that originate in - algebra, group theory, topology, and functional analysis.

Researchers use multi-program workloads to evaluate proposed designs and policies for various aspects of multi-program execution. Unfortunately, the fixed workload and variable workload multi-program workload methodologies used today are unsound and lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the proposed research is aimed at investigating a new multi-program workload construction scheme, called FIESTA (Fixed Instruction with Equal STAndalone runtimes), in which application samples are chosen so that individual application have equal runtimes when executing alone. Samples are then mixed and matched to form multi-program workloads, but the same samples are used in every experiment. The research will investigate two issues related to FIESTA: Generation of application samples and Extension to multi-threaded environments. FIESTA workloads should produce results that are internally consistent and plausible.<br/><br/>Computer architecture research surges when new tools, benchmarks, and methodologies are introduced and distributed. The quality and depth of single-program experimental evaluation improved when efficient sampling and simulation techniques like SimPoints were introduced. FIESTA should provide the same impetus for multi-program execution research and education, while becoming the standard methodology for sampling both single-threaded and multi-threaded programs.

Generally, the researchers will improve existing analytical methods and develop new statistical methods for the reconstruction of past climates from heterogeneous geological proxies (tree rings, ice cores, speleothems, corals, sediments), with particular emphasis on regional variability over the past two millennia. <br/><br/>Specifically, the research team will use the regularized expectation-maximization algorithm (RegEM) algorithm to exploit linear covariation in space among different climate variables or proxies to impute missing values and estimate climate statistics. The goal is to directly address uncertainties in data, especially surrounding missing data within a series.  This is important for paleoclimate data sets since the spatial or temporal series may not be continuous.<br/><br/>The broader impacts involve the training of students across disciplinary boundaries in a timely integration of statistics and climatology.

Yet, managing social dynamics in work groups is challenging, particularly when the groups are diverse in terms of gender, ethnicity, or cultural backgrounds. <br/><br/>This research tests questions about work group dynamics derived from multiple theories of social influence. The aim is to move beyond questions about the pros and cons of diversity to understanding the processes by which demographic differences may influence group dynamics and performance, which will have more important implications for practice. The studies will explore such questions as: How do societal-level status differences influence multidisciplinary groups' social dynamics and performance? What types of social interactions facilitate both equity and efficiency in groups?  <br/><br/>The study will be conducted in multidisciplinary engineering laboratories that are at the forefront of scientific and technological innovations. From a policy standpoint, the attraction and retention of female and minority scientists and engineers has been a concern in both academic and corporate settings.  The findings from the proposed research will have practical implications for facilitating inclusive and productive working relationships in diverse teams.

One example for social learning is the acquisition of song by songbirds: During a sensitive period early in life, young males learn to imitate their father's song. Songbirds provide tractable models of culture: Members of a species show individual variation in song, and geographically separated groups have local song dialects, i.e., a local song culture. How does song culture develop over multiple generations? In zebra finches, birds kept isolated during the sensitive period develop an abnormal (isolate) song. Interestingly, in an isolated colony founded by an isolate, normal songs with species-typical features emerge within 3-4 generations, due to biased imitation that gradually transforms the isolate song into the species-typical song. Understanding how song develops in individual birds and how song culture develops in a community might require knowledge not only about the vocal, but also about the sensory-perceptual development across generations, as well as the social interactions which accompany it. This project is a combined study of social, vocal, and sensory aspects of song development. The investigators will design controlled social environments to examine dynamically how song is acquired and how song culture emerges. They will combine the continuous analysis of vocal changes and social interactions with non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain to investigate how auditory brain responses to songs develop, and how they drive cultural changes. Moreover, these researchers will test if developmental changes in brain architecture correlate with observed vocal and/or sensory changes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). <br/><br/>This research will provide a bridge between studies of vocal and sensory changes and ethology studies of cultural changes in vocal communication.  This project will contribute to the training of three graduate students, and provide scientific education and research training to undergraduate students as well as middle and high school students in the community.

The project team is revising undergraduate core industrial engineering courses to add an emphasis on environmental and social consciousness and sustainable practices, identifying critical issues in sustainable development that will be integrated into the curriculum, developing modules containing new learning material and case studies customized to fit within each industrial engineering course, and developing a new stand-alone course on sustainable development.  The evaluation effort, under the leadership of a university-wide evaluation unit, is using student and faculty surveys, focus groups, and assessments of student products to monitor progress.  Dissemination is being accomplished through website postings, conference papers, journal articles, and faculty development workshops.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the instructional material and graduates that have a social and environmental awareness and the skills to contribute to a more sustainable future.

The measurements will be made using an optical measurement technology which has only recently become available, and which allows continuous in-situ observations to be made on a practical basis.  Further measurements will be taken of the size distribution of precipitation hydrometeors at the top and bottom of the tower, as well as measurements of the surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat (using a sonic anemometer and a high speed hygrometer) and soil heat flux (using a conductive plate).  These measurements will complement existing measurements of carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2), and meteorology at the tower, and the water vapor measurements would be taken at the same heights as the CO and CO2 measurements, at 22, 100, and 300 meters.  In addition, measurements of the isotopic composition of precipitation and soil water would be taken by students at several middle schools in the region and analyzed for isotopic composition.  The middle schools will also be supplied with meteorological observing stations, and students will take meteorological measurements and receive instruction on atmospheric processes and the science of isotope hydrology.  The research seeks to evaluate 1) the role of rainfall evaporation (virga) in controlling the isotopic composition and humidity of the summertime boundary layer, 2) the partioning of the surface energy and water fluxes, through isotopic constraints on the transpiration fraction of surface latent heating, and 3) the degree to which pairing water isotope measurements with other gas measurements, such as CO2 concentration, yield improved estimates of gas exchange between the surface and the overlying atmosphere.  The measurements will be used to constrain and validate simulations from the Community Land and Community Atmosphere Models.<br/><br/>The isotopic composition of precipitation and water vapor contains a wealth of useful information, including the temperature at which evaporation occurs over the ocean, the extent to which evapotranspiration over land serves as a source for subsequent precipitation (i.e. the strength of the land-atmosphere coupling), the pathways of water vapor transport in the atmosphere, and the strength of trace gas exchange (including CO2) between land and atmosphere.  But the multitude of factors determining isotopic composition makes it difficult to extract the useful information, particularly given our limited quantitative understanding of some of the physical processes.  Research conducted under this project will thus serve the climate science community by helping to deconvolve the factors determining isotopic composition, and unlock the valuable climatological information contained in it.  In addition, the participation of middle school students in the project will serve the general public, including underrepresented groups, in surrounding communities by offering an early exposure to scientific research.  Educational activities will also take place at the University of Colorado involving graduate and undergraduate students, including a project in which engineering students design and build a mechanical device to collect rain and snow samples.

This motion is accommodated by a complicated and incompletely understood belt of deformation along the western margin of the Great Basin that links major, misaligned strike-slip faults in eastern California and western Nevada.  Based on previous research and our preliminary work, we have identified that the deformed belt underlies a region of nearly 15,000 km2 and contains large tectonic blocks that both translate toward the northwest as the crust is pulled apart and also undergo vertical-axis rotations of 20∞ to 90∞.  In this project, we will provide a better understanding of the dimensions of the tectonic blocks, how far they have moved laterally, to what degree they experienced vertical-axis rotation, and the spatial-temporal pattern of deformation.  Much of the western borderland of North America and many parts of other continents around the world reside in similar tectonic settings and record comparable histories of deformation.  This study will provide the opportunity to better understand how and to what degree the translation and rotation of large crustal blocks is accommodated as the continental crust is fragmented in response to the relative movement of lithospheric plates.<br/><br/><br/>Crustal response to displacement transfer in structural stepovers linking misaligned segments of large-magnitude transcurrent faults is accommodated by components of translational and rotational displacement and strain and results in complex three-dimensional arrays of structures.  The mechanisms by which rotational and translational strain are accommodated either by rigid-blocks and/or by distributed strain and to what degree the translational and rotational processes are coupled in space-time are poorly understood.  In this study, we integrate detailed and regional geologic mapping with thermochronologic, structural, and paleomagnetic analysis to unravel the history of transcurrent structures separating the Sierra Nevada and central Great Basin.  The objective of the work is to characterize transcurrent and high-angle normal fault displacement, estimate slip on low-angle detachment faults, and assess the relation between translational deformation and differential rotation.  Our research results will provide the needed detailed understanding of the spatial and temporal pattern of deformation and supply the constraints to differentiate between coeval and serial translational and rotational deformation histories within the stepover system and provide the means to assess whether or to what degree rotation is accommodated by rigid-body motion or distributed strain processes.

Such linkages may operate differently across biogeographic scales because factors known to affect local predator mechanisms also vary with latitude. The mismatch between knowledge of how predators locally affect ecosystem functions and the biogeographic range at which predator-prey interactions occur inhibits understanding of linkages between ecological communities and ecosystems, and thus our ability to manage valuable ecosystem services. Intertidal oyster reefs provide a model system to address this knowledge gap: they occur throughout the mid-Atlantic and Gulf coasts; they contain a similar food-web assemblage across latitudinal gradients in predation, resource supplies, and environmental conditions; they are strongly influenced by predator effects; and they influence sediment and nutrient cycles by enhancing benthic-pelagic coupling. This research involves a series of standardized sampling and experimental studies to: (1) investigate biogeographic patterns in oyster food web structure, resource supplies, environmental conditions, and sediment properties associated with reef function (2) determine how the vital rates of oysters, which can influence benthic-pelagic coupling, vary geographically; and (3) examine experimentally the relative importance of consumptive and non-consumptive predator effects on oyster reef communities and the ecosystem processes they provide and how these effects vary latitudinally. It will provide a mechanistic understanding of the basis for biogeographical shifts in valuable ecosystem services performed by an important marine foundation species, and it will also advance understanding of the interactions between predator effects in food webs and the ecosystem processes that depend on them.<br/><br/>By linking predator effects and benthic-pelagic coupling on oyster reefs in a biogeographic context, this research will provide valuable information to resource managers charged with restoring oyster reefs and recovering ecosystem services. By promoting the exchange of conceptual and methodological ideas among research groups at four major research universities, this project has already and will continue to foster interdisciplinary expertise among its investigators as well as their future graduate and undergraduate students. In addition to mentoring a post-doc, this research will prepare at least three graduate and three undergraduate students for scientific careers by having them independently develop projects related to the project.

Among many other benefits, it detects the knot genus (the least complicated surface whose boundary is the knot), and in particular, whether a knot is non-trivial.  It is a homology theory, and like many homology theories the Euler characteristic is interesting: for knots, the Euler characteristic is one of the oldest knot invariants, the Alexander polynomial.  Heegaard Floer homology is part of a family of recent homology theories whose Euler characteristic gives other knot polynomials.  But it can be hard to compute, and is defined by ad-hoc rules rather than a concise set of properties.  In this project, we will develop a theory of bordered homology invariants: extend the Heegaard Floer homology and other homology theories to objects (knots or 3-manifolds) with boundary, so that when a knot or manifold is split into pieces the invariant for the whole can be computed from the invariants for the pieces.  Among other benefits, this will make the theory more computable, and give axioms for the theory.<br/><br/>Although knot theory has been studied for many centuries, some of the most elementary questions, such as finding the least complicated surface whose boundary lies on the knot, are still not easy to answer. Heegaard Floer homology is one recent theory that answers this and many other questions in knot theory and topology.  However, it is hard to compute even for relatively small knots.  In this project, I and my collaborators will extend Heegaard Floer homology (and other related theories) so that they can be computed for pieces of a knot and then built up to the complete knot.  This promises to provide a great computational and theoretical tool.  Throughout the project, accessibility will be emphasized, and the project will be integrated with, for instance, an undergraduate research program.

Deposit shapes vary from rings around a coffee drop, to hexagonal cells and fractal patterns. An interdisciplinary team of Columbia University scientists will study the related fascinating multiscale physics, using a combination of experimental, theoretical and numerical techniques. The team has the following skills: multiphase flow (Attinger, PI), colloids (Somasundaran), pattern recognition (Chang) and open-source computational fluid dynamics (Spiegelman). The complex self-assembly of nanoparticles will be studied by using first physical principles to explain the resulting selfassembled patterns (what we call a top-down approach), and by identifying features in the patterns that are signs of specific basic laws or transport rules (bottom-up approach).<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>Experiments will involve the spotting of microdrops of complex fluids on various substrates, fluorescence microscopy and laser profilometry to scan the three dimensional deposits. The first intellectual merit will be to describe with a phase diagram the self-assembly of nanoparticles during liquid evaporation on a solid substrate. The use of a phase diagram in that context is novel and allows a simple but powerful comparison of the magnitude of competing transport phenomena, such as evaporation at the wetting line, Marangoni recirculation, electrostatic and van der Waals forces, buoyancy, and dielectrophoresis. The phase diagram will provide an insight and an overview of the complex interplay between multiphase processes, influenced by the geometry of the liquid drop or film: fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mass transfer, colloidal interactions.  Second, an available proprietary 2D-axisymmetric numerical code with a moving mesh able to very accurately track the free surface will be extended to 3D (see Chandra collaboration letter).  This will allow the simulation of a wider ranges of boundary conditions, permitting the consideration of thin films and complex geometries.  Explaining the self-assembly of nanoparticles from evaporating drops and liquid films from first principles is a challenging approach, given the multiple transport phenomena and time/length scales. Therefore, we will also develop a bottom-up approach based on pattern recognition of selfassembled features. We will test the hypothesis that the patterns tell us the about the physics that created them.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/><br/>The proposed research will deliver innovative solutions to pattern nanoparticles on solid substrates, with applications in organic electronics and patterning of biomolecules for biosensors.  Methods to increase printing resolution by two orders of magnitude (see Sonoplot letter), and to pattern uniform layers of particles will be investigated. The pattern recognition algorithms developed in this proposal will be tested to identify biomolecules (see Zenhausern letter) and enhance the accuracy of bloodstain pattern analysis, in collaboration with forensics expert MacDonell (see collaboration letter). Also, the 3D code developed in this proposal will be distributed freely as an open-source code, allowing every interested scientist to study problems involving drop and film transport phenomena such as drop impact, drop evaporation, film drying. Funding will support one graduate student.

Specifically, the<br/>investigator and his collaborators develop a family of algorithms<br/>that focus mainly on (1) Fast, high-order numerical solutions for<br/>wave-propagation problems in domains that contain geometric<br/>singularities, and (2) Scattering problems from penetrable<br/>electromagnetic periodic structures, with a particular emphasis<br/>on resonant problems relevant to the design of photonic crystals<br/>and Negative Index Materials (NIM).  The investigator<br/>concentrates on development and implementation of a massively<br/>parallel computational framework based on integral equation<br/>formulations capable of producing fast and high-order solutions<br/>of wave scattering problems of realistic complexity.  The<br/>approach consists of the following main elements: (a) High-order<br/>resolution of the singularities of the solutions of the boundary<br/>integral equations in non-smooth domains; (b)<br/>Pseudodifferential-calculus-based design and analysis of<br/>well-conditioned integral equation formulations leading to small<br/>numbers of Krylov-subspace iterations for a wide range of<br/>electromagnetic transmission problems; and (c) Use of equivalent<br/>sources, FFT-based acceleration algorithms, and implementations<br/>that take advantage of the newly available Graphic Processing<br/>Units (GPUs) computational platforms to dramatically enhance<br/>computational times and capabilities. <br/><br/>     The algorithms that are developed as part of this project<br/>are of fundamental significance to diverse applications such as<br/>electromagnetic interference and compatibility (electronic<br/>circuits), dielectric/magnetic coated conductors, and composite<br/>meta-materials (photonic crystals and Negative Index Materials). <br/>The simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation in complex<br/>structures gives rise to a host of significant computational<br/>challenges that result from non-coercive formulations,<br/>oscillatory solutions, geometric singularities, resonances, and<br/>ill-conditioning in the high-frequency regime.  The recent<br/>efforts of the investigator and his collaborators resulted in the<br/>development of a highly efficient computational methodology that<br/>resolved several of these difficulties and whose extension<br/>enables the fulfillment of an ambitious plan: to simulate with<br/>high fidelity realistic scattering environments with a high<br/>dynamic range.

While there is extensive research into shock induced void collapse, if there are mechanisms for wave attenuation or if the impact velocity is relatively low, stress wave loading will instead occur. The objective of this research is to quantify the effect of loading wave profile on the hydrodynamic interaction and damage mechanisms of multiple void collapse. Under distributed loading, the wave profile and void and inter-void length scales can be comparable, potentially resulting in a strongly coupled interaction and precluding the direct application of shock wave collapse models, for example to predict cell and tissue injury in biomedical applications. Tissue and cell destruction by pulsed laser induced waves can have enormous biomedical treatment benefits for example in retards to cancerous tumor growth, however, severe collateral damage of surrounding tissue can also result. One mechanism for trauma is the dynamic response of voids subjected to the pressure pulse, which is attenuated from an initial shock with an increase in rise time by interaction with acoustic heterogeneities in the body. Predictive models for tissue damage under these loading conditions are critical to the use of these powerful techniques.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>Dynamic experiments are designed to highlight the interaction and damage mechanisms of voids collapsing after passage of a stress wave. In biomedical applications, the ramped wave profile (or rise time) is found to correlate better with tissue damage than the peak pressure. To the PI's knowledge, the collapse of voids under these conditions has not been previously studied.  Experimental time resolved visualizations of void collapse, the first velocity field measurements in the surrounding material, and internal and external temperature measurements will be carried out in a model experimental setup which allows accurate placement of 2D and 3D void arrays in a tissue surrogate polymer material. Initial work by the PI has shown the internal volume history is nonlinear, in agreement with simulations but in contrast to existing linear experimental data fits. The role of rise time will be examined as additional parameter to the overall pressure ratio across the wave. In the case of multiple voids, velocity measurements show the stress wave diffracts in response to the upstream void, affecting the subsequent loading condition.  Both collapse-inhibiting (shielding) and collapse triggering effects are observed and will be quantified.<br/><br/>Broader impacts The capability for accurate prediction of tissue and cellular damage has a profound impact on treatment options across a broad range of biomedical applications including extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, laser induced plasma surgery, and ultrasound. The CAREER research and educational plans are interwoven through the incorporation of research results in hands on activities that reach three age groups: local community children, middle school students, and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Through this integrated research and education plan, undergraduate students will be exposed to interdisciplinary study and will showcase their research results to demonstrate opportunities to middle school students, particularly through the Girls Adventures in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science (GAMES)and Girls Do Science programs. These programs target girls at middle school age level, when a dramatic decrease in self esteem in academic settings has been widely reported. The Aerospace Engineering GAMES program is currently being developed by the PI in coordination with the College of Engineering at Illinois. The overarching goal is retention of academically talented middle school girls in math and science by demonstrating the social validity, breadth of opportunity, and the community benefits of engineering, and by providing the opportunity for learning through team based projects, exposure to the University, and meetings with role models and mentors. The PI will also continue her successful record of recruiting and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in engineering, as well as on going participation in outreach activities such as Girls Do Science.

This complexity is the result of several interconnected geophysical observations that reveal not only a current snapshot of Earth's state of planetary evolution, but also a 4.6 billion year historical record of global scale geodynamic processes and events that have shaped the surface upon which we live as well as the oceans and atmosphere.   Our research focuses on furthering our understanding of Earth's 'deep history' by investigating enigmatic structures known as thermochemical piles, which reside near the base of the mantle, just above the boundary with the core.  The lateral extent, size, temperature, composition and geologic significance of these structures is presently a subject of great interest because of their potential relationship to the origin of volcanoes, driving forces for present-day tectonic plates and the fate of long-ago subducted tectonic plates.  However, their remoteness from Earth's surface - roughly 3000 kilometers down - makes them an especially elusive target for geophysical investigation. <br/><br/>Because of inherent resolution limits and selective sensitivity to the full spectrum of geomaterial properties, no single geophysical method is sufficient for painting a complete picture of this region of the Earth.  We propose to study the thermochemical state of the lower mantle through a comprehensive set of numerical experiments, and comparison to observational data, for mutually compatible electromagnetic and geodyamic models.  The union of these methods is based on the strong sensitivity of electromagnetic observations to thermochemical variability as manifested in the mantle's electrical conductivity, and the sensitivity of geodynamics modeling to material parameters such as density and viscosity that control the accumulation of material in the lower mantle and that material's thermal structure.   Central to these experiments is the over-arching question: How do we, or can we, constrain our knowledge of the thermo-physio-chemical state of the lowermost mantle through geodynamically-compatible electromagnetic observations?   Computational experiments will be conducted with a new, parallel electromagnetic MANTle Induction Simulator (project MANTIS) for distributed memory compute architectures, which shares the same underlying mathematical discretization as the CitcomS code that will be used for the geodynamic simulations.  This compatibility between discretization methods between the two codes is important for minimizing numerical artifacts as material properties from the electromagnetic domain are mapped into corresponding properties in the geodynamic domain.

This is called consolidation. Although consolidation in sleep is a key function in learning, the detailed mechanism is not clear. In this project, Dr. Yuka Sasaki of the Massachusetts General Hospital aims to clarify consolidation in sleep by combining cutting-edge brain imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional MRI (fMRI). Particularly, the focus of the project is on examining the mechanism for sleep consolidation of learning of a visual task (perceptual learning) that is known to be associated with changes in a highly localized region in the visual cerebral cortex. Researchers are measuring spatio-temporal activation changes in the localized region during the initial period of sleep (non-REM sleep) after training on the visual task. Brain activity with high spatial resolution is obtained using MRI along with high temporal resolution brain signals obtained with EEG and MEG. By combining these signals with both temporally and spatially high resolution, the detailed mechanisms of sleep consolidation are being clarified. How such brain activity changes during sleep is related to improvement in performance on the visual task (the amount of perceptual learning) is being examined. The results from this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of sleep consolidation of perceptual learning.<br/><br/>This project provides rare opportunities of training and educating undergraduate and graduate students. Students learn cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques, such as the use of multimodal combinations of EEG/MEG/MRI, as well as functional MRI technique applied to retinotopic mapping. They also learn the theoretical backgrounds of the techniques. In addition, students learn how to analyze behavioral data through psychophysical experiments. Moreover, understanding of the consolidation process of memory and learning during sleep can help to improve education, by informing us how what is learned can be more efficiently and firmly memorized. In addition, therapeutic methods can be developed to eliminate or weaken bad and undesirable memory and learned habits, including traumatic memories, smoking, and obsessive behaviors.

However, recent studies have indicated that only special turbulent flows are truly self similar. Experiments and computations in buoyancy driven turbulence have indicated that late time turbulence can be affected by ICs seeded into the flow and memory of these ICs are not lost. <br/><br/>This presents a remarkable opportunity to predict and design late time buoyancy driven turbulence that leaves behind the fully developed equilibrium concept, and embrace late time turbulence through prescribed ICs that either enhance, or suppress, or maintain turbulence intensity/structure in these flows. The objective of the proposed research program is to evaluate late-time signatures of ICs that will result in a better understanding of mix dominated buoyancy problems with widespread applications in heat exchangers, chemical reactors, climate dynamics, pollutant dispersion, inertial confinement fusion, and, astrophysical flows. <br/><br/>The research includes experiments and simulations. The experimental thrust will involve a novel two wheel high acceleration experiment that uses controlled ICs to experimentally study the late time turbulent material (molecular) mixing for RT flows. High fidelity diagnostics which include a combined fast-Particle Imaging Velocimetry/Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (f-PIV/PLIF). This will provide detailed data of ICs in each experiment, and field measurements of flow velocities, statistical probability density functions of density, velocity fluctuations and associated turbulence correlations and cross correlations. In addition, implicit Large Eddy Simulations (ILES) are planned to cross-couple with the experiment via validation and verification (V&V) of the simulation and therefore provide additional detailed data sets to study the late-time effect of designed ICs. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merits:<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the proposed work involve usage of the experimental and computational data sets to: (a) examine the role of ICs to control the molecular mixing dynamics; (b) provide valuable information on active control of turbulent mixing as occurs in various applications of such flows. In addition, the proposed research is expected to result in new discoveries about the mixing process which can also be used to extend turbulence theory beyond the traditional ideas of Kolmogorov which is related to the existence of inertial range dynamics and small scale universality. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>The proposed research extends well beyond our interest in buoyancy driven flows and incorporates the possibility of systematically designing initial and boundary conditions for passive control of late time turbulence. On the educational front, it will help support two graduate students and will introduce students to cutting edge research ideas in a graduate level course on Turbulent Flows. Undergraduate researchers will be included through the Missouri S&T-OURE (Opportunities for Undergraduate Research Experience) program. The students who will perform the bulk of this research will be actively recruited from underrepresented groups (women and minority) at Missouri S&T through the Women in Science & Engineering (WISE) program on campus. In addition, active collaboration with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) will aid in the potential impact of this work and is expected to result in future research opportunities for graduate students upon completion of their degrees.

It is difficult to sustain for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that most researcher training and regulations governing human research are based on a top-down model in which the research is done on, not collaboratively with, someone or some community. Yet CBPR is one of the most effective ways to translate basic research into socially beneficial programs. As CBPR has gained scientific significance, the scientific establishment has only begun to develop models for reducing the barriers to successful CBPR. This workshop examines these models in an integrative way. It explores new stakeholder configurations, guidelines, technologies, cultural considerations, and funding arrangements that promise to overcome barriers and render CBPR more productive and robust.<br/><br/><br/>This workshop is the second in a series of annual national gatherings on CBPR at the University of Houston. The intellectual merit of this and subsequent workshops resides in the research partnerships that will be created to advance basic and applied research as it moves from the lab to the community. Without carefully crafted partnerships that involve all stakeholders in a truly collaborative relationship, community-focused research tends to fail to deliver the intended products: valid research and willingness of the community to embrace and benefit from the application of the new research based ideas.<br/><br/>Broader Implications. The broader implications are the direct benefits, not normally found in more traditional research approaches, to diverse communities that share in the design and application of various research interventions.

This airborne LiDAR will cover representative research watersheds of the LCZO and extend from the US Forest Service Luquillo Experimental Forest to the surrounding coastal areas. During the airborne data collection a complete set of carefully located (using GPS) biophysical measurements, such as diameter of trees, canopy closure, leaf-area index, and crown height will enable a much more effective modeling of the watershed topography and processes from the LiDAR point cloud. Because the over flight has been scheduled for the summer of 2010, the ground verification campaign must be conducted at the same time. <br/><br/>Airborne LiDAR is similar to radar, except that it operates at a much shorter wavelength for detecting small-scale changes in topography. However, to be most effective, ground-based measurements must be done simultaneously to map relevant features such as vegetation height and type, since the LiDAR signal will be received from the top of the tree canopy as well as from the ground. This project will accomplish the task in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory to insure that the research progam at this NSF-supported facility will be able to document small changes in watershed characteristics that are the result of climatically-driven weathering and erosion.

The occurrence of such events can have tremendous impact on system performance, especially intermodal (IM) systems, and can lead to significant economic loss. A secure and functioning transportation system is of paramount importance to society. To ensure that effective transport services can be provided in a disaster's aftermath, enabling society to recover, agencies charged with constructing, managing and operating these systems must invest in measures that prevent or mitigate the effects of disaster incidents. This research effort recognizes that the post-disaster performance of transportation networks depends not only on the inherent capability of the system to absorb externally induced changes, but also on the actions that can be taken in the immediate aftermath of the disaster to preserve or restore system performance. Identification of the appropriate pre-event preparatory and post-disaster recovery actions and related investment allocation decisions can play a crucial role in lessening ensuing post-disaster economic and societal loss. This effort will provide a comprehensive set of tools, that explicitly consider opportunities for post-disaster recovery activity, to support rail-based IM system performance measurement, operational decision-making, preparedness planning and immediate post-disaster action. The development of such tools requires the mathematical modeling of complex dynamic and stochastic systems and creation of exact algorithms and faster heuristics for solution of large-scale real-world problems. Developed tools will aid the managers of these critical lifelines to effectively address threats from disasters. While results of this effort will have wide applicability, its focus is on rail-based IM passenger and freight transport systems and their components (e.g. passenger depots, IM terminals, ports). <br/><br/>The performance measurement, preparedness planning and operational decision-making tools developed through this effort will provide support to infrastructure managers and IM system operators of rail-based IM passenger and freight transport systems, facilitating optimal investment decisions aimed at preventing or ameliorating the effects of disasters. Application of these tools will aid in securing the IM transport networks and address society's need for a stable system. Competing existing measures, such as reliability and flexibility that do not consider recovery actions, may underestimate the networks ability to cope with unexpected events and may lead to unnecessary or misdirected investment. Rail-based systems have comparatively low negative socio-environmental external costs as compared with vehicular transport, a mode that contributes to ever-increasing roadway congestion, pollution, and the depletion of our worlds energy resources. Thus, these systems are needed to mitigate the impact of our industrial juggernaut from which demand for efficient goods transport is derived. This research effort focuses on improving the ability of such systems to resist and recover from disaster, thereby improving the competitiveness of this much needed greener transport alternative.

These properties offer distinct advantages in electrochemical applications such as solar cells and supercapacitors.  In these potential applications, the electrical double layers (EDLs) at the interfaces of electrodes and ionic liquids play a critical role in determining the system performance. However, the knowledge on these EDLs is very limited: many fundamental issues such as the capacitance potential correlation and the capacitance of EDLs in ultrasmall nanopores are poorly understood at present. Such a limited understanding renders the design and optimization of electro-chemical systems using ionic liquids as electrolyte difficult, and thus prevents the potential of ionic liquids from being fully exploited. Therefore, it is critical to improve our understanding of the EDLs in ionic liquids.  The objective of this research is to investigate the electrical double layers (EDLs) in ionic liquids using molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, the PI will first study the EDLs at the interfaces of ionic liquids and planar electrodes to delineate how their structure and capacitance are affected<br/>by the electrical/physicochemical properties of electrodes and ions. The EDLs in ionic liquids-filled sub-nanometer pores will then be studied to elucidate the synergistic effects of nano-confinement and surface curvature on the structure and capacitance of EDLs in these pores.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: In the study of planar EDLs, a new picture for the EDLs in ionic liquids, i.e., the Ion-ion and ion-electrode correlations play a key role in determining the EDL structure, is proposed. This picture represents a paradigm shift from the prevalent EDL models, and is supported by compelling preliminary data. Guided by this new idea, the PI?fs simulation design and data analysis differ distinctly from those in prior research and are expected to lead to new insights into the dependence of EDL structure on the nature of ions and on the polarization/chemistry of electrodes. With this, the PI will  elucidate the mechanism of the diverse capacitance?]potential relations and surprising ion specificity of EDL observed in previous experiments, which defy existing EDL models. In the study of EDLs in sub-nanometer pores, by doing simulations in pores with precisely defined geometry and by simultaneously computing the microstructure and capacitance of the EDLs, the PI's group will, for the first time, self-consistently test the prior hypotheses on effects of confinement and surface curvature on EDL capacitance in sub-nanometer pores, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the test result. Together, these researches will greatly advance the fundamental understanding of the EDLs in ionic liquids and make a firm step towards building the knowledge base for the rational design of electrochemical systems using ionic liquids as working electrolytes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will be tied intimately with the educational activities at Clemson University. Students participating in this project will be exposed to diverse fields such as physical chemistry, atomistic modeling and computational methods. Undergraduate students will be involved in the research through the Honors Research Program in the PI's home department.  Various resources, e.g., the minority recruitment programs at Clemson University, will be utilized to recruit students from underrepresented groups to participate in this project. Research results will be developed into posters/movies to introduce electrical energy storage to K-12 students. Research will be disseminated through journal publications and presentations in professional conferences. A website centering on the fundamental physics of the EDLs in ionic liquids and their role in electrochemical systems will be developed and maintained. The website will be advertised to the target audience via formal and informal channels.

Temporary housing is the phase during which victims move from short-term or improvised sheltering arrangements to more home-like living arrangements, so they can begin restoring household, employment, schooling, and other routines. With extensive damage to the capital and other population centers, providing temporary housing for homeless earthquake victims is a major priority for disaster recovery.  <br/><br/>This study involves multiple trips to Haiti to track the progress of temporary housing activities, with an emphasis on decision making and planning by international agencies, the Haitian government, and non-governmental organizations. These decisions are important because the projects that are undertaken will critically affect the ability of individuals, households, neighborhoods, and communities to recover. Mistakes are often made in attempts to provide housing for disaster victims, which complicates the recovery process and negatively affects recovery outcomes. The sheer severity and scope of the Haiti earthquake make both planning and carrying out temporary housing projects extremely challenging. New housing arrangements also must ensure victims? safety in light of the potential for aftershocks, hurricanes, flooding, and other hazards. There is a need for both urgent decision making and strategies that facilitate, rather than interfere with, the recovery process. This project seeks to determine how aid providers try to balance these two potentially conflicting demands. Data for the study are obtained through direct observation of meetings at which decisions are made, interviews with decision makers and providers of housing, and documents related to housing and household recovery.<br/><br/>Despite its importance, relatively little attention has been paid to the temporary housing phase of disaster recovery. Studying temporary housing strategies, implementation processes, and outcomes in Haiti has the potential for improving disaster assistance and humanitarian aid programs. It is important to analyze both decisions and their outcomes, particularly after catastrophic disasters and in situations in which multiple severe hazards must be taken into account during the disaster recovery process. Lessons learned can help guide aid efforts worldwide and will also contribute to current U.S. efforts to plan for recovery after catastrophic disasters.

This collaborative award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering, Americas Program and the long-term goal is to advance scientific knowledge on disaster resilience. The objective of this award is to enhance scientific knowledge concerning the role of social capital, as an important component of resilience, in the early recovery process following the January 12, 2010 Haiti earthquake in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area. To achieve our study objective, we have three specific aims: (1) Document the pre- and post-disaster social capital in three diverse Port-au-Prince communities; (2) Document the housing recovery process in three selected Port-au-Prince communities; and (3) Assess the impact of pre- and post-disaster social capital on the speed and quality of housing recovery in these communities. The selected communities are PÈtionville (a high-income area), Delmas (a middle-income area), and CanapÈ Vert (mainly a squatter area). <br/><br/>The study will involve two waves of data collection (a baseline and a follow up) spaced six months apart in Haiti. In each wave, the project team will conduct in-depth semi-structured interviews of policy makers/practitioners and community leaders, and focus groups with community residents. In addition, a member of the team based in Haiti will conduct participant observation by attending community and public meetings on post-disaster housing recovery. Lastly, the team will review secondary sources, including post-disaster housing recovery plans, newspapers, minutes of public meetings, laws and regulations, published documents.  The study will capture time-sensitive and perishable longitudinal data on the recent earthquake in Haiti that will contribute to knowledge on early post-disaster housing recovery, social capital, and resilience. <br/><br/>The project will have the following outcomes.  First, the study will enable policy makers to establish long-term recovery policies that take into account each communities unique needs and capabilities rather than developing one size fits all policies to guide recovery interventions. Second, it will help identify the capabilities of selected Port-au-Prince communities. Third, the study will contribute to enhancing education and the research infrastructure at Florida International University, Arkansas State University, Boston University, and the UniversitÈ d?Etat d?Haiti. Fourth, it will strengthen institutional ties between these universities. Fifth, the study will enhance participation of under-represented groups (e.g., women, Hispanics, Haitians, economically disadvantaged students) in disaster research.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering, Americas Program.

The project will include a new, open technology for generating computational data web services; an open, portable, optimized data warehouse that supports very fast queries of plant biology data; and a plant biology query language, query builder, and query optimizer that will provide a simple way to limit query results to only the required data. The project will provide a range of data access methods to serve the needs of computational biologists and bench biologists for large and custom datasets.  Implementation of this software at TAIR will provide REST and SOAP web services for computational use of TAIR data, RSS feeds for TAIR objects, and an implementation of a new query builder for TAIR.<br/> <br/>While strong advances have been made in data generation methods including new genome sequencing methods, high throughput phenotyping, protein localization and others, computational access to the resulting data still requires large amounts of both human and machine resources. By addressing this issue through architecture, this project leverages advances in software engineering by combining and applying them to the specific domain of plant genomics. In particular, developing a minimal but effective plant genomics schema using modern data modeling; leveraging model-driven architecture to enable generation of high-performance web services from platform-independent models; and developing a basic, well-formed query language for the plant genomics domain are intellectually challenging tasks that will have a significant impact on the technology required for computational access. Wide adoption of a standard set of web interfaces for computational access to plant genomics resources will greatly simplify the effort required to access and integrate plant genomic data, thereby facilitating computational analyses of the data.  By providing an easy, robust, and consistent route to computational data access, standard web interfaces will also facilitate development of new resources that could transform existing datasets and present them in new ways, analogous to mashups using Google Maps data along with real estate listings, weather data, Wikipedia entries, etc. By providing computational APIs and the technological infrastructure to create them as open source tools, this project makes available a key set of technologies to computational biologists beyond TAIR. As the technology proves itself, it can move beyond plant biology into the more general biological realm.

The event is considered one of the world's worst environmental disasters. It is the largest such disaster in U.S. history.<br/><br/>This research looks at the social impacts of this technological disaster on communities in the region. Specifically, it seeks to understand how the disaster has affected relationships among individuals and groups in the area. Sometimes referred to as social capital, relationships, connections, or networks among people create trust. Trust is critical because it allows people to work together toward common goals and it fosters community wellbeing. Research has shown that social capital plays an important role in community recovery after a disaster. Following disasters, social capital facilitates information sharing, enhances social support, and helps communities gain access to needed resources by increasing capacity for collective action. Little is known, however, about the ways in which disasters affect social capital. <br/><br/>This study involves interviews and household surveys in Roane County, the site of the spill, and in nearby Anderson County which will serve as a control. Data collected after the spill will be compared with data from the 2000 Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey. The study will also follow communities over time. Research questions focus on social relationships after the disaster and how they are related to individual and community stress and coping; beliefs about who is responsible for the spill; beliefs about science, technology, and risk; and how social capital may influence community recovery. <br/><br/>Despite its importance, relatively little attention has been paid to how social capital contributes to disaster resilience. Resilience not only includes a community's ability to bounce back from an event, but also its ability to withstand the effects of a disaster in the first place. Studying social capital in the aftermath of the Tennessee coal ash spill will increase understanding of community resilience to disasters. Research findings can guide local and regional recovery efforts related to this specific incident. More broadly, results will inform current nationwide efforts in the United States to prepare and plan for recovery after environmental disasters.

In this study, the community scale refers to neighborhoods or similar spatial units that comprise an urban area.  Our central research question is:  To what extent can the extent of building damage predict the severity of disruption to the communities social fabric and economic function?  Is there a linear relationship between damage rate and disruption? Or are there thresholds of damage beyond which disasters become catastrophes?  How does the relationship between damage and disruption change over time in the initial response and restoration periods?  Post-earthquake Haiti experienced an extensive range of damage and disruption across the urban landscape, thus providing a rare opportunity to investigate these questions within the context of a single disaster event.<br/><br/>Fieldwork will focus on gathering two types of information:  1) damage data to ground-truth available remote satellite information on building damage, and 2) data on socio-economic disruption at the community scale. Gathering the damage data is time-sensitive because the field information must be temporally consistent with the remote sensing images. Gathering the disruption data is time-sensitive because the information will be based on field interviews that seek to elicit judgments and recollections about conditions in the immediate aftermath and first few months of the disaster. These data must be gathered quickly, in order to capture the perishable recollections and situational observations that rapidly fade from memory.<br/><br/>This research will be undertaken using three complementary approaches: 1) automated, semi-automated and visually-based analysis of high resolution satellite and aerial remote sensing imagery; 2) acquisition and expert interpretation of street-view GPS referenced photographs and video using the VIEWS field data collection system; and 3) interviews with NGOs involved in community-scale relief, response and recovery within Haiti (supplemented with secondary data). Data collection will focus on 8-12 selected Haitian communities that collectively represent a broad range of earthquake damage severity.<br/><br/>The study extends the research teams current work on methods for measuring community disruption and recovery following Hurricanes Charley and Katrina, by testing U.S. methods in the context of Haiti. It also draws on the research teams experience with remote sensing-based damage assessment for the Haiti earthquake (through the GEO-CAN initiative) by extending the nationwide work to the community scale.<br/><br/>In addition to the datasets on damage and disruption to be developed, a primary outcome of the research will be analysis of the relationship between damage and disruption over space and time in the Haitian case.  We envision that the outputs of this research will take the form of a report documenting our findings about disruption and the restoration of basic needs in the selected Haitian communities. Remote sensing and in-field survey results will also be documented and displayed through online media including the Virtual Disaster Viewer.

The northern region of Haiti was relatively unaffected by the 7.0 magnitude earthquake on January 12, 2010, that caused extreme physical damage experienced in the areas in and around Port-au-Prince and the southern region. One might question what the role of an already fragile health system could, or would be, during response and recovery in the face of such an extensive catastrophe. The underdeveloped nature of the health system might support an argument for top-down response from international sources, particularly in the absence of leadership from the Haitian government or Haitian disaster management structures. This research explicitly takes the view, however, that even in a place that is the poorest in the Western Hemisphere, structures and resources exist through which international assistance and response could work to draw on capacities within the local system.  <br/><br/>Through an assessment of what health-related Haitian and NGO resources were operating in this region and an articulation of the level of coordination and cooperation between them, the research will contribute to an understanding of local capacity, particularly in a developing country setting. The study also recognizes that any attempt at sustainable recovery planning and/or disaster mitigation necessitates directly incorporating the Haitian health sector as a building block and so the data collection will establish a baseline for future assessment of the recovery process. The findings can also suggest possibilities for hospital disaster planning beyond Haiti in places with stressed health systems. Most significantly, this research incorporates a partner with a long standing presence in Haiti and a design with a feedback loop so that findings have greater potential for use in capacity building at this location.

The humanitarian challenge following the January 12, 2010 Haiti earthquake provides important lessons that may end up serving as a watershed moment for the field of humanitarian logistics. Quite notably, while some prominent efforts experienced major delays in the distribution of supplies to the people in need, other unheralded operations did so with great efficiency. Understanding the factors that explain degree of success, and assessing the scalability of the successful ones, could open the doors to new paradigms of humanitarian logistics that overcome the kind of challenges that hampered efforts in Haiti. The project seeks answers to such important questions. In doing so, the team would build upon data collected in the first two weeks after the disaster, validate initial findings with additional data, and create the foundation for the integration of findings into models to support relief flows and operations.  The main objectives are to: (1) to identify a preliminary topology, and the basic features of the alternative humanitarian logistic structures that have emerged in Haiti and in areas supporting the effort; (2) to gather insight into their level of effectiveness, positive and negative traits, manpower provided, coverage and extent of their operations, among others; (3) to gather data about the actual flows of critical and non-critical supplies, and their dynamic patterns over time; and (4) to document lessons learned, both positive and negative.<br/><br/>This project would provide the first systemic characterization of the alternative humanitarian logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event. The findings produced by such characterization would: (1) enhance theoretical understandings of organizations and organizing in extreme event environments; and (2) set the stage for advanced modeling of these various approaches. Since improving humanitarian relief operations can reduce human suffering and loss of life in disasters, solving these problems is of national and international import.  Specifically, the project will: (1) promote multidisciplinary collaboration on the humanitarian logistics problem; (2) integrate students to a multidisciplinary and international research process, with a particular emphasis on recruiting underrepresented students; (3) generate findings that will be integrated into disaster and logistics courses; (4) generate findings with applied benefits that will be broadly disseminated to organizations engaged in the practice of humanitarian logistics, including those stakeholders in Haiti.

Resilience, being described as a dynamic and complex process, requires measurements at multiple timescales of relevant indicators that include infrastructure reconstruction, mitigation activities, public disaster expenditures, local employment, housing permits, retail sales, and personal income. By integrating atmospheric properties of storms, physical attributes of a region?s built environment and economic characteristics, the proposed model is capable of forecasting the rate of recovery in a local economy at multiple timescales. Key resilience indicators are identified and their effects are estimated with data collected from past events. Because these data are quantifiable and verifiable, we are able to produce a model with enhanced reliability and robustness. Two primary objectives are pursued: 1) model the progress in built environment recovery using remotely sensed image archives; 2) model the rate of economic recovery using time-series data at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level. We are exploring a potentially transformative concept by developing a quantitative model in both economic and physical dimensions of recovery. As the result, a critical knowledge gap between assessing the immediate damage of hurricanes and understanding its broader and lasting impacts could be bridged. The result will afford further numerical evidence for both complementing and strengthening existing theories in urban redevelopment and disaster recovery.<br/><br/>The success of this research has the potential to greatly improve the long term economic well-being of communities in hurricane-prone regions with better designed public policies and investment. The outcomes and methodologies will be introduced as part of graduate curriculum as well as through websites and other academic outlets at both Texas Tech and East Carolina Universities. The project will support doctoral students in Wind Science and Engineering and Coastal Resource Management at two collaborating institutions. These activities will provide valuable training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, nurture the next generation of experts in multidisciplinary disaster-focused research, and contribute to the knowledgebase of hazard mitigation. It could also catalyze fundamental changes to help communities become more physically, socially and economically resilient in facing future disasters.

The purpose of this project is to enhance the impact of STEP through activities in three primary areas: 1) conducting site visits to projects that may be in need of additional feedback or support, 2) developing an informational document suitable for distribution to external audiences regarding achievements in STEP, and 3) conducting three regional workshops per year aimed at faculty who might be interested in submitting a proposal to the program. <br/>Intellectual Merit <br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in development of a community of scholars engaged in STEP projects. Through the professional development workshops being conducted by this project, faculty and administrators across the country are learning about best practices in student recruitment and retention and will be able to apply these best practices on their home campuses. PIs who have participated in a site visit are able to make adjustments and improvements to their project to enhance the impact of their work. <br/>Broader Impacts <br/>STEP is essentially a program focused on broader impacts. Active STEP projects are focused on broadening the participation of undergraduate students in STEM fields, so improvements to individual projects have an overall positive impact in this area. The informational document being developed through this project serves to disseminate achievements from active STEP projects, to facilitate greater understanding of best practices in recruitment and retention of STEM students among STEM faculty, and to educate the broader scientific community about the challenges and successes in recruiting and retaining undergraduate students in STEM disciplines.

Examples of large-scale CATs include the Graduate Record Examination, the Graduate Management Admission Test, the National Council of State Boards Nursing, and the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery.  An advantage of CAT over paper-and-pencil exams is that it provides more efficient estimation of abilities because it can appropriately tailor item selection to the estimated abilities of examinees.  This research addresses two areas of critical importance for CAT.  First, flexible models for response times will be developed to assist in controlling the duration of an exam, and also to assist in the measurement of ability in appropriate circumstances.  Second, statistical methods for constraint management will be developed to ensure that an exam has sufficient information to diagnose fine-grained skills while also providing an accurate summary score.<br/><br/>The impact of the research will be to provide technology to better utilize response-time information and also enhance the ability of CAT to provide diagnostic information.  Models for response-time distributions will be developed that make few assumptions concerning functional form and allow for dependence between response times and a latent trait that represents ability on the studied domain.  Estimation techniques will be developed that may be used with data previously collected from exams administered with CAT.  Algorithms for utilizing estimated response-time distributions will be constructed to better manage duration of exams and to extract information from response times to better estimate the ability the exam is designed to measure.  In addition to addressing response times, the problem of managing the diagnostic information to assess mastery of fine-grained skills will be studied for exams that also aim to provide a single summary score.  CAT methods for adaptively selecting items to more efficiently provide a score will be modified to simultaneously balance the coverage of skills and attributes of interest.

This project focuses on intermediate data that is generated during the execution of parallelized dataflow programs in clouds. Such cloud intermediate data brings forth several unique characteristics: they are massive-scale, distributed, subjected to computational barriers, and prolong job run-times when subjected to server failures. Further, the size of intermediate data in a cloud application is often comparable to or larger than input or output data size, and it can thus range in terabytes. Thus, in spite of extensive existing work on traditional storage problems, there is a critical need for new algorithms and systems that target cloud intermediate data.<br/> This project is the first to treat cloud intermediate data as a first-class citizen. The project will involve new algorithm design and analysis, original systems building and implementation, deployment in real world testbeds, and performance of measurement studies. Concretely, this project will build a new system that explicitly manages intermediate data in cloud dataflow programs in order to improve their fault-tolerance, and design and realize barrier relaxation strategies to improve performance of cloud programs. We will implement using open software, deploy, and experimentally evaluate our systems atop the NSF infrastructure called the Cloud Computing Testbed (CCT) that is hosted at the University of Illinois. Finally, we will perform measurement studies of workload characteristics of cloud intermediate data. <br/> A fuller understanding of intermediate data in clouds can spawn research in managing cloud infrastructures, improve run-time performance of cloud applications, and lead to new cloud programming paradigms. Our contributions will directly improve the performance and fault-tolerance of applications that are run on the community infrastructure CCT, and positively impact design and deployment of existing and emerging industry clouds. Our results will be published and released in open software and datasets.

Shapiro. In addition to the PI, the funding supports one postdoctoral research associate, one graduate student during the two summer months and two undergraduate (REU) students to assist in the research. The intellectual scope of this research program spans several problems involving general relativity, the generation of gravitational radiation, relativistic hydrodynamics, and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. A common thread uniting the different theoretical topics is the crucial role of gravitation, especially relativistic gravitation. Compact astronomical objects such as black holes and neutron stars provide the principal forum, and the dynamics of matter in a strong gravitational field is a major theme. Some of the topics for investigation include the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries (binary black holes, binary neutron stars, binary black hole neutron stars and binary white dwarf neutron stars), the generation of gravitational waves from binaries and other promising astrophysical sources, gravitational collapse, the stability of rotating, relativistic stars and the evolution and final fate of unstable stars, gamma-ray burst sources, and the formation and growth of supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies and quasars. Most of these topics represent long-standing, fundamental problems in theoretical physics requiring large-scale computation for solution. Hence the approach involves to a significant degree large-scale computations on parallel machines, as well as analytical modeling. Many of the numerical calculations employ the state-of-the-art computational resources of the UIUC's National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). They comprise both initial value and evolution computations and treat vacuum spacetimes containing black holes as well as spacetimes containing realistic matter sources and magnetic fields. The results have important implications for astronomical observations, including those planned for gravitational wave interferometers, such as LIGO and LISA, and have the potential to transform our understanding of the underlying phenomena.<br/><br/>This project has broader impacts beyond the solutions to the specific research problems that it tackles. An appreciable portion of the funding is devoted to the education, training and support of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students. These students collaborate with the PI on the majority of research topics funded by the project. The grant supports the activities of the PI's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) team at UIUC in computational astrophysics and general relativity theory. The training that each of the PI's undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students receives in large-scale computations and scientific visualization, as well as in several different areas of theoretical physics and astrophysics, prepares them to pursue professional careers in a broad range of scientific and technical fields. The computer algorithms and numerical codes that are developed are useful to other groups working in computational physics and astrophysics. Through the research and outreach activities of the PI and his group, the grant helps promote the use of computers and visualization tools at all levels of education, as well as the public awareness of some the latest and most exciting developments in gravitation physics and astrophysics.

Anonymous communication mitigates the dossier effect, where third parties can accumulate enough information about users to construct a detailed profile, regardless of the use of encryption.  This project addresses two key research issues in anonymous communication: scale and performance.  To support large user bases, it is necessary to redesign the current centralized architecture of anonymous communication systems and replace it with a peer-to-peer one.  The project studies the myriad security, privacy, and performance issues introduced by such a change.  Better performance will improve the usability of anonymous communication to make it a reasonable option for routine Internet use.  The ultimate goal is to make anonymity technology accessible to all people for appropriate uses and to integrate it into basic Internet protocols.

The present work seeks to further develop recently-discovered methods to control the concentration and movement of atomic defects in semiconducting ceramics such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. The methods are based upon manipulation of chemical bonds at the material surface or illumination by ultraviolet light. Controlling the defects will help improve the performance in diverse applications such as solar hydrogen production by water splitting, environmental water remediation by photocatalysis, and gas sensing.  This research is taking place in parallel with development of an industry-supported laboratory course for upper-division undergraduates and graduate students called 'Chemistry and Transport in Semiconductor Materials Synthesis.' In addition, several activities to promote the importance of ethics in science and engineering are being pursued.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Specially synthesized isotopically-labeled structures are used in conjunction with self-diffusion measurements to determine generation and annihilation rates of interstitial atoms or vacancies at surfaces. The experiments involve observation of the isotopic profile evolution by secondary ion mass spectroscopy, with supplementary experiments by photoreflectance to measure the magnitude of near-surface electric fields.  Detailed modeling of the defect diffusion-reaction networks underpins experimental interpretation. The experiments examine the effects of controllable chemical adsorption and surface crystallographic orientation upon the insertion and generation of bulk defects mediated by chemically unsaturated surface bonds ? both neutral and electrically charged.  In addition, optical stimulation effects are quantified by analogous experiments performed under super-band illumination, and interpreted in terms of changes in the charge state of either the surface or the defects themselves.

A combination of system testing and component testing will be used to assess the behavior of these systems as designed today.  These experimental results will then be used to advance models for the analysis of such systems under large deformations and to identify critical details that have a major impact on system performance.  Cost-effective details that transform performance will be developed and tested at the component level and then incorporated in system tests. At the component level, steel connections will be tested under combined rotation and tension loading, and important details of the slab on deck system, such as lap splices, beam anchorage, and the tensile behavior of the slabs on metal decks in orthogonal directions will be tested. System tests will involve large-scale push-down tests of gravity frame systems using current practice details and new concepts developed in this research.<br/><br/>The results of this research will directly impact the safety of almost all steel buildings by assessing the integrity of ubiquitous structural components and developing models for engineers to employ.  It will also develop transformative solutions for improving the robustness of common gravity frame components and systems.  Through close collaboration with the American Institute of Steel Construction, expedient dissemination and rapid implementation will be facilitated.  Graduate students will be directly trained through this research as they address the challenges associated with unanticipated structural loadings. Interest and diversity in engineering will be enhanced through partnerships with the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program at Purdue, the Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP) at Illinois and the Seattle Mathematics Engineering Science and Achievement Program (Seattle MESA) at Washington. These programs will provide for undergraduate (SURF and SROP) and high school (MESA) research internships.

Epitaxial Au nanocrystals on TiO2 will be used as a model system for study. Epitaxy provides interfacial uniformity and also provides better control of nanocrystalline shapes. TiO2 is selected because of its function as a reducible oxide for catalyst support and the extensive knowledge about its surfaces in the literature. The Au nanocrystals will be synthesized using the deposition and annealing technique developed in the PI's group. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy will be used to characterize the structure of the Au nanocrystals and their interfaces. The structural data will be used to measure the surface and interfacial energies of the Au nanocrystals as a function of size.  On the theoretical front, the interfacial and triple-line geometries, the local electronic density of states, and the energy of Au on TiO2 for different epitaxies will be computed from first-principles. The combination of experiment with theory is expected to lead to significantly improved understanding of the structure and property relationships in nanocrystal surfaces and interfaces.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Substantial parts of materials technology, major components of chemical industry, and exciting new developments in medical diagnostics and treatments rely on the properties of supported metallic nanoparticles. The unusual functions of metallic nanoparticles come from the synergistic interactions of surfaces and interfaces of nanoparticles and their support. However, modern studies have largely avoided the complexity of supported nanoparticles; nanoparticles are too small for experimental characterization and too big for rigorous theoretical investigations. This project is to study nanocrystal surfaces and interfaces by taking advantage of the recent progress in atomic resolution imaging using aberration-correction in transmission electron microscopy and combining it with nanocrystal synthesis and theory. The research will be integrated with outreach efforts, including high school visits and undergraduate education. Results from this research project will be incorporated in the web-based educational materials for teaching students about atomic structure and diffraction, infrastructure for which is already in place (see http://emaps.mrl.uiuc.edu/ or google webemaps). This particular website is now listed as one of the best web resources for learning electron diffraction and electron diffraction pattern indexing in the standard transmission electron microscopy workplace.

Compressed sensing is a recent breakthrough in mathematics that enables to do this sensing and conversion more efficiently and reliably than ever thought possible. Key to this, is the availability of efficient dictionaries that enable very compact representation of natural signals. While dictionaries have been developed from mathematical principles, a recent discovery is that their efficiency can be greatly enhanced, if the dictionary itself is learned from examples of the data. Because compressive sensing depends critically on the interaction of the dictionary with the sensing mechanism, joint learning of the two from the data itself is expected to provide the greatest benefits. However, to date there have been only a handful of heuristic attempts in this direction. The investigator is developing the first <br/>systematic theory for dictionary learning, and for joint learning of dictionaries and sensing mechanism. He will demonstrate the theory and algorithms on real sensing applications, and in particular on challenging medical diagnostic applications.<br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to develop theory and algorithms with performance guarantees for (i) learning dictionaries for sparse signal representation for compressive sensing; (ii) joint learning of dictionary and the sensing operators optimum for compressive sensing; and to demonstrate the  theory and algorithms on challenging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) applications. Ultimately, this research may lead to MRI and CT techniques for improved imaging of the beating heart or brain function from less data in less time, improving health care and reducing its cost.

Solecki has been investigating properties of the pseudo-arc, which can be thought of as the generic curve, with emphasis on a certain dynamical problem concerning the group of symmetries of this mathematical object. The analysis done so far indicates that the solution to the problem lies on the intersection of descriptive set theory and model theory (branches of logic), Ramsey theory (a branch of combinatorics), and topological dynamics (a branch of topology).<br/>To be more precise, by a work of Irwin and Solecki that uses model theoretic ideas, the dynamical problem can be translated into a purely Ramsey theoretic question concerning finite objects. A more recent work of Solecki shows that structural Ramsey theoretic theorems of the appropriate type do hold in certain situations.<br/>One of the aims of this project is to extend these combinatorial results. The desired extension is in a very close agreement with the expected internal developments of structural Ramsey theory. In another part of the project, Solecki will apply methods coming from descriptive set theory and topology to classifying mathematical structures that involve directed orders and come from various areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>In the project, Solecki will apply techniques and notions developed in mathematical logic and in combinatorics to problems in other areas of mathematics. For example, he will investigate the symmetries of a space called the pseudo-arc. These types of spaces were first introduced in mathematics in the first quarter of the twentieth century as curious examples of complicated curves. Today, we know that they appear naturally in many mathematical contexts, for example, in fluid dynamics, in smooth dynamical systems living in Euclidean spaces, among topological groups, in the study of continuous functions, etc. Solecki intends to gain a better understanding of the pseudo-arc by using methods from diverse subfields of mathematics (combinatorics, logic).<br/>Problems that have arisen in these investigations have already lead to new theorems that are of purely combinatorial and of purely topological interest. Such mutually stimulating interactions between distinct areas of mathematics are expected to continue. In a similar manner, other parts of the project feature interactions of descriptive set theory, model theory, topological dynamics, and combinatorics in the study of extreme amenability and in classification of mathematical objects according to Tukey reductions.

Prof. Murphy and her students will study how to modify the surface of gold nanoparticles and nanorods with ligands and proteins to form objects that will be recognized by cells as natural proteins. Achieving this goal requires significant increase in our ability to control ligand orientation and coverage on the surface of gold nanostructures. The study could lead to the development of new and improved nanometric carriers with the capability to selectively deliver drugs into cells. The use of plasmonic forces to heat the gold nanostructures could facilitate controlled release of drugs into the cells. The study will provide excellent training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students in the cutting edge research area of nanobiotechnology.

The workshop seeks to cross traditional disciplinary boundaries to develop the new knowledge needed to better manage the impact of natural hazards in major urban areas.  The potential impact of large-scale natural hazards on today?s urban agglomerations is so huge, they can be called Mega-City/Mega-Disasters (MCMD).  The workshop will explore specific strategies for rapid emergency response/recovery/rebuild during MCMD.  In addition, it will closely examine the broader questions that surround these issues, including factors that may cause long-term changes in the risk of disaster and factors that may affect and impede response by governments, agencies, and populations.  To accomplish these objectives, the workshop will assemble a diverse group of international specialists working at the forefront of their respective fields to explore and promote opportunities to develop more effective approaches for disaster mitigation in large urban areas.  In particular, specialists in emergency response and recovery, social economics, land use policy, natural hazard (e.g., wind, flood, landslide and earthquake) mitigation, and information technology will participate.  The workshop will allow researchers and practitioners from different countries to espouse a common research framework in disaster mitigation that leverages existing global research infrastructure for multinational cooperative research.  In addition to the PI, workshop organizers include Michael Goodchild, University of California, Santa Barbara; Jerome Lynch, Iniversity of Michigan; and C.H. Loh, National Taiwan University, Taiwan. The meeting is jointly funded by the Office of International Science & Engineering and the Directorate for Engineering Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation.

These special sizes, often referred to as Magic Number Sizes, are of great interest in materials chemistry and physics because often they are evidence of unique underlying properties of the material. AgSR is an interesting polymer in that it grows as stacked flat bilayers.  The PI envisions lamellar AgSR to be a new model building block for bottom-up self assembly of superstructures that can be used in a variety of new material applications in physics, chemistry, biology and microelectronic technologies. The PI recently developed a new synthesis method using nanoparticles of metal which generates large AgSR crystal platelets.  These crystals have diameters of 1 micron and heights of up to ~30 layers thick with nearly atomically flat surfaces (Langmuir 2009). One major objective in this proposal is to exploit the unusual planar attributes of AgSR and to extend this new synthesis path to produce crystals of the fundamental minimum thickness, one-layer two-dimensional AgSR crystals.  This one-layer crystal is the ultimate starting point for bottom-up self-assembly synthesis.  Discovery in 2004 of graphene has defied the conventional wisdom that these thin crystals could not exist because of an inherent instability in part due to reduced melting temperature (size-dependent melting).  A major objective of this proposal is to measure the melting of these 1-layer crystals which to date has never been done.  This goal will be accomplished using Nanocalorimetry.  These structures can be used to study thermodynamics and size-dependent melting phenomenon with single-layer control of crystal size which has been implausible except for cluster beams. The PI proposes to study size-effects in this system using NanoDSC in addition to the formation of liquid crystal and metastable phases.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>    The scientific impact of this work will be in the development of generating new synthesis methods for applications in the microelectronics industry. Furthermore the new characterization techniques developed in thermal analysis will greatly expand our scientific ability to probe material properties at a very small size scale which is useful for advancement in Nanotechnology.   The broad impact of this research will include the education and training of graduate students in the field of nanotechnology and the development of new synthesis methods. The students will be educated and trained in fabrication of MEMs devices using microelectronic techniques and in using self-assembly synthesis methods. Almost all of the students who have been trained by the PI are currently working in the microelectronics industry.  In addition to formal journal articles, the dissemination of this work will be in the form of conference talks given by both the PI and graduate and undergraduate students along with Nanocalorimetry short courses in specialized Thermal Analysis conferences.  By further developing the capabilities of the synthesis methods and NanoDSC technique, this work will add to the fabrication and instrumentation infrastructure of the country for basic science as well as for technology.  Scientific collaborations are expected to be developed in the area of Thermal Analysis with groups in Spain and Canada as well as other research groups in the United States.

Charles Ying	06/30/2013	$456,699.00		abelson@illinois.edu	SUITE A	CHAMPAIGN	IL	618207473	2173332187	MPS	1775	6863, 9161	$0.00	Technical: The proposed work will develop methods of low temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to afford uniform, smooth, and pinhole free thin films on substrates that have high aspect-ratio openings such as deep trenches and vias. Such films are required for a wide variety of advanced technologies, e.g., diffusion barriers associated with copper metallization in integrated circuits. The CVD method can also completely fill these features at reasonable rates. Examples to date include the coating and filling of high aspect ratio (30:1) vias, 100 nm in diameter, with HfB2 or MgO films.<br/>Three experimental approaches are used to achieve excellent coating properties. (i) Unique CVD precursor molecules with high vapor pressure produce a site-blocking effect on the film growth surface, such that the surface reactivity is low but the growth rate is acceptable. (ii) Inhibitor species are added to the growth process to modify the surface reactivity: H atoms impinge on, and bind strongly to the most exposed (upper) surfaces and lead to bottom-up film growth; molecular species such as NH3 or dme uniformly lower the growth rate such that a ?non conformal? precursor will afford a highly conformal film. (iii) Inhibitor species are used to enhance the density of nuclei on a substrate by reducing the growth rate of the first-formed nuclei with respect to the rate at which new nuclei form. This has the effect of greatly smoothing films of few-nm thickness, and of eliminating pinholes. The approaches have transformative potential in the field of thin film growth.<br/>This research employs surface science techniques and kinetic modeling to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the surface reactions involved in highly conformal chemical vapor deposition of thin films. That intellectual synthesis across disciplines ? surface physics, surface chemistry, and thin film materials science provides enabling scientific knowledge to guide further development of conformal CVD. For example, it affords quantitative metrics for the necessary properties and behavior of precursor molecules and inhibitor species.<br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance, and is expected to provide unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate training in an interdisciplinary field. This research project is also expected to have broader impacts through the training of scientists in this research field and through the wide dissemination of the findings of this research through publications. The PI will mentor a REU student and one or two undergraduate senior theses in the group. Graduate students and undergraduates from under-represented groups are recruited via the University of Illinois programs SURGE (Support of<br/>Under-Represented Groups in Engineering) and WISE (Women in Science and Engineering). One woman Ph.D. student is associated with this project at the time of writing. Periodic news stories also report the developments and cite the crucial role of the National Science Foundation in the process of discovery.

Many natural problems in these two areas are NP-Hard and approximation algorithms have been a very successful approach to address this intractability. In addition to providing algorithms and heuristics, approximation is a useful lens to examine the structure of NP-Hard problems. Despite the enormous progress made in the area of approximation algorithms and hardness of approximation, several basic and fundamental problems still remain wide open. This project will examine several interrelated problems from four broad areas. Our main tools will be linear and mathematical programming methods coupled with graph theoretic ideas. The problem areas of interest are:<br/><br/>(i) Multiflow and routing problems such as maximum disjoint paths, congestion minimization and flow-cut gaps.  The central goal is to understand the relationship between fractional multiflows, integer multiflows and cuts both in the throughput and concurrent flow settings. (ii) Network design, in particular obtaining a poly-logarithmic approximation for the directed Steiner tree problem, and approximability of variants of the survivable network design problem. (iii) Traveling salesman problem (TSP), orienteering and related tour and walk problems in directed graphs. (iv) Submodular function maximization subject to constraints and applications.<br/><br/>The proposed research is at the intersection of algorithms, classical combinatorial optimization, mathematical programming, and graph theory. The technical work serves to exchange ideas between these areas and it is expected that it will lead to new algorithms and heuristics for fundamental problems. These problems arise in many applications in computer science (in particular network problems), operations research, and engineering; these would benefit from the algorithmic advances. The project will train two PhD students and a manuscript on algorithms and applications of submodular function maximization is expected to be produced.

Solitary water waves of arbitrary amplitude are constructed for a general class of vorticity. A priori bounds will be obtained for Stokes-kind waves with vorticity. Long-time existence for small data will be established for the water wave problem and the vortex sheet problem with surface tension. The phase instability and blow-up will be investigated. Dispersive properties of the effect of surface tension and their consequences will be studied. The Benjamin-Feir instability will be analytically understood for Stokes waves on deep water. Stability and instability of generalized vortex patches will be investigated. Emphasis is taken on the large-scale dynamics and nonlinear behavior of the wave motions at interface; the studies ultimately hinge upon analytical proofs.<br/><br/>Surface water waves are manifested in a variety of natural phenomena which may be observed on the surface of the ocean or the river; they range from ripples to tsunamis or rogue waves. The subject constantly attracts attention of mathematicians as well as physicists and engineers. Furthermore, a considerable part of the mathematical theory of wave motion has been pioneered on the basis of studies of water waves. A key objective of this project is to develop new methodologies and theories in the analytical studies of surface water waves and related interfacial waves. Results from this project will help to furnish underlying principles of numerical simulations and engineering designs for the surface water waves phenomena. Deep analysis of particular problems involving water waves will stimulate the development of new mathematical ideas and analytical techniques for solving other highly nonlinear problems.

This project establishes a series of three Summer Institutes on BSBA (SI-BSBA) for early career researchers and graduate students from the U.S. and Taiwan. SI-BSBA is jointly organized by the PI and Professor Shuo-Hung Chang of National Taiwan University and is funded in the U.S. by the National Science Foundation and in Taiwan by the National Science Council. The goals of the Summer Institute are to provide a platform for researchers from a diverse background to exchange ideas in the BSBA area, to train students and researchers in the highly interdisciplinary BSBA area who are knowledgeable in both engineering and biology, and to promote international collaborations in the BSBA area between researchers in the US and in Asian Pacific region.  Each institute will include approximately twenty students/early career researchers from each side. SI-BSBA activities include a 2-week Summer Institute on BSBA alternately held in the US and in Taiwan. Experts in the BSBA area from engineering and biology will be invited to give lectures on the basics of sensing/actuation technologies and fundamentals of biology, as well as on the state-of-the-art research topics. Hands-on laboratory training of basic engineering tools such as micro- and nano-fabrication, basic tools from cellular level to organism level studies, and BSBA components such as neuron-networks and computational tools will be conducted. The impact of SI-BSBA will be significant and far-reaching, including developing new research tools, transforming the existing research methodologies, and potentially leading to solutions to some of the biggest challenges in society such as the environment, healthcare, sensor networks, and multi-functional materials. Furthermore, the international experiences of the participants will be extremely valuable to the next generation of US scientists and researchers.

This study develops a better understanding of how patterns of integration correspond to variation in primate movement and how genes affect the ways in which skeletal traits are integrated with one another.  The research compares bone morphology among a large number of primate species to test the hypothesis that integration in the limbs is the result of adaptation by natural selection in response to the different performance requirements that species encounter. It uses a similar comparative approach to test hypotheses about whether patterns of integration structured or were structured by adaptive evolutionary shifts in response to selection on locomotor behavior.  In order for bones to evolve, there must be genetic variation in bone shape and size, but there is little know about which genes are involved in producing this variation in normal, healthy organisms.  This project uses a very large population of mice to relate aspects of bone shape and size to specific regions of the genome. Comparisons between the patterns of integration in mice and primates, including humans, will then help guide future investigations into what role these genes have had in the evolution and development of human skeletal morphology. <br/>At a practical level, understanding how humans differ from our closest evolutionary relatives in skeletal patterns of integration will aid future studies of many physical health problems, such as back pain and bad knees, which are directly attributable to our unique morphology.  Understanding the genetic basis of bone size and shape in the mouse will help guide future investigations into the development and hereditary basis of diseases that affect the skeleton. Understanding how the integration of bones varies across primates, including humans, will provide a fresh perspective on how these differences have evolved. This is particularly important when considering the origins of humans' unique, bipedal mode of locomotion. Additionally, the understanding of the genetics of bone shape will be very informative for continuing investigations into the links between development and the evolution of organismal form. This research will afford many students, including a substantial number from underrepresented groups, with hands-on research experience in a way that will help them be able to synthesize a new understanding of how organisms develop and evolve. Furthermore, students will receive training in state of the art morphometric scientific imaging, and statistical computing technologies and methods. This will allow them eventually to pursue fruitful independent research programs in any of several biomedical fields.  Public understanding of science will be aided by the production of a large number of digital representations of bones that can help students at many educational levels visualize biological variation.<br/>

Focusing on the core with the longest sediment sequence currently available (ODP1002), this research will generate the first continuous decadal resolution marine record of climate and environmental change over the last ~550,000 years. The researchers employ XRF scanning to generate high-resolution geochemical records from Termination II (~140,000 years ago) back to the base of the recovered sequence, providing a cost-efficient and logical extension of high resolution XRF scanning already completed on the younger part of the core. The XRF data will provide insights into the rates and magnitudes of climate change on multiple timescales and over multiple glacial-interglacial cycles when natural climate forcing differed substantially. The data will shed light on tropical climate sensitivity on the timescale of human generations. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research.

It is produced as very cold, dense water formed over the Antarctic continental shelves sinks down the continental slope as a density outflow, entraining ambient deep-ocean water masses as it descends. There has been recent progress in understanding the dynamics and modeling other major density currents, notably those in the Nordic and marginal seas. However, less progress has been made in understanding Antarctic density flows, hampered primarily by a lack of detailed field data. As a consequence we do not, at this time, have a clear answer to two following fundamental questions:  What is the relative importance of processes believed to determine the production rate and hydrographic characteristics of AABW at the primary formation sites around Antarctica? Why do Antarctic outflows retain sufficient density contrast to sink to the deep ocean floor, whereas most other outflows entrain sufficiently vigorously to reach neutral density at intermediate depths?<br/><br/>Based on an extensive profile and mooring data set obtained in and around an energetic density outflow during the Antarctic Slope (AnSlope) field program in 2003-2005 in the NW Ross Sea, the investigators have defined a numerical modeling study that can address the above questions. Analyses of the field data, and exploratory modeling efforts, suggest that Antarctic outflows are significantly impacted by the following factors: (1) small-scale (sub-Rossby radius) topographic variability (corrugations, isobath convergence, continental slope curvature, steep slopes); (2) nonlinear interaction of the outflow with cross-slope advection and mixing associated with 'independent' energetic processes such as tides; and (3) nonlinear equation-of-state effects, notably thermobaricity. An extensive set of numerical studies using a spectral element Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model will be carried out to study the sensitivity of outflow dynamics and AABW production to these factors. The models will be guided by Antarctic field data (AnSlope, and complementary programs in the southern Weddell Sea), but will be applied to idealized topographies and hydrographic fields. We will develop parameterizations of Antarctic density outflows and AABW production rates, and test these within the framework of coarser-resolution regional ocean models using Regional Ocean Modeling Sysytem. The study will address the overarching objective of improving the representation of AABW formation in climate system models.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merits: This project is the first known application of an LES model to the climatologically significant problem of global bottom water formation around Antarctica. We will use this tool to quantify the relative importance of the principal factors influencing the production rate and properties of AABW over parameter ranges that cover the major Antarctic outflows. Outcomes will be compared and contrasted with outflows elsewhere in the world ocean.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The parameterizations that we will develop will improve our ability to simulate AABW production in earth climate system models that cannot resolve the small spatial and temporal scales of the outflow and its entrainment processes. AABW is a critical component of the meridional overturning circulation and is the dominant contributor to ventilation of the global deep ocean. One graduate student will be supported at RSMAS/UM by this grant. The Earth and Space Research (ESR) Co-investigator will continue to provide scientific oversight for a Western Oregon University grant to develop K-12 curricula and educate teachers in climate science. Presentations will be given at annual training workshops, and Oregon and National Science Teacher Association meetings. Both ESR and the University of Miami maintain specific web pages focused on education and outreach.

The study will place emphasis on the sediment clogging caused by oil filtration and ensuing changes to the structure and function of indigenous microbial communities.  Although the process of oil contamination of beaches has been investigated in great detail, little is known about the effect of crude oil on beach filtration and the effect of oil-related reduction of beach pore water flows on oil transport and microbial degradation within the sandy sediment.  This filtration process, caused by wave set up and tidal water level changes, constitutes an effective pumping mechanism that can drive low-viscosity crude oil and detergent-oil mixtures deep into beach sediments.  Oil transport into deeper, anoxic layers may decrease oil degradation rates, thereby extending the period of toxin release to nearshore waters.  Goals of the project are to assess 1) how much and how deep oil is filtered into the beach, 2) how oil alters the beach filtration rate and thereby sediment oxygenation, 4) how oil contamination changes structure and function of the sand microbial community and 5) which factors regulate oil degradation by microbial communities in marine sands.<br/><br/>To quantify these processes, sets of sediment cores will be taken at time intervals along a short transect from the supralittoral to the sublittoral zone at a sandy beach in the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico.  The sediment will be analyzed for oil content (amount, composition and distribution), sediment characteristics (permeability, porosity, grain size spectrum, oxygen penetration), and the microbial community (composition and activity).  Oil will be characterized using a GC-MS.  Changes in microbial community composition and activity will be assessed using a combination of culture-based and cultivation-independent molecular techniques.  The results will quantify the uptake of oil and detergent-oil mixtures into Gulf sand beaches, the effect of these substances on sediment physical and biogeochemical properties, the response of the sedimentary microbial community, and oil degradation rates. <br/> <br/>Broader Impacts: The sandy beaches of the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico are of high ecological and economical value as they are biotope, foraging and breeding area of a large number species, and present a main tourist attraction.  Tourism is Florida?s largest sector of the state economy with about 60 million visitors every year and a $57 billion impact.  The pollution of the beaches by crude oil thus presents a major threat to Florida?s economy.  Previous research indicates that oil can penetrate deep into sandy beaches, which may change microbial community activities and decrease the oil degradation rates.  Consequences include toxin release from such beaches extending over many years.  Understanding the uptake, transport and degradation of oil in sandy Gulf beaches is prerequisite for designing clean up and remediation procedures.  Research of this project focuses on pristine Gulf beaches for which no data on oil penetration and degradation exist and that now are threatened by the Deepwater Horizon disaster.  The project combines research with education and training of two graduate students.  Project results will be published in scientific journals, local outlets and the internet.  The data collected in this rapid response project will provide data for a proposal of a three year project focusing on transport and degradation of crude oil components in permeable shore sediments.  The project goal is to generate quantitative data that permit forecasting of the oil degradation process and optimization of bioremediation procedures.

The work specifically addresses the generation of sumesoscale, ageostrophic flows by mesoscale interactions with topography by explicitly resolving the relevant scales of 0.1-10 km in the horizontal. Numerical simulations will be designed to calculate the cascades of energy, enstrophy, and tracer variance and compare with theories, which will also be developed and improved within the scope of the project.  The high resolution simulations will be performed in the Kuroshio region where strong topographic features and the the western boundary current dynamics will allow robust testing of the hypotheses. It is hoped that the work will lead to new understandings of the submesoscale regime, the dynamics that connect balance and unbalanced flows, and perhaps even lead to new parameterizations which can be used to represent these processes in ocean and climate models.

Swarms are shaped by an interaction of endogenous social forces with exogenous environmental ones. A kernel describing the social forces is a key element of swarm models. To improve the mathematical understanding of these models, to clarify how exogenous and endogenous forces interact to influence aggregation pattern and morphology, and to provide biological insight into aphids and locusts, we carry out three projects. (1) We analyze and simulate a broadly applicable differential equation based model describing organisms whose movement is due to endogenous and exogenous forces. We connect properties of swarm patterns to properties of the two forces. (2) In experiment, we measure trajectories of pea aphids moving within a group. Using the model from (1), we quantify the social kernel. (3) We generalize the study from (1) by incorporating a dynamically evolving kernel that models social and antisocial behavioral phases in desert locusts. This work will suggest swarm control strategies to minimize aggregation and hence ameliorate some of the negative economic and humanitarian impacts of locust swarms.<br/><br/>Turing patterns arise from a competition between reaction and diffusion in diverse chemical, biological, and physical systems. To contribute to the mathematical and chemical understanding of forced patterns, we perform experiments on the chlorine dioxide - iodine - malonic acid (CDIMA) Turing system. Specifically, we force Turing patterns with a time-periodic light source and measure how the resulting pattern suppression scales with forcing parameters.<br/><br/>These projects incorporate education through research involvement of twelve undergraduate student researchers, including women, other underrepresented minorities, and post-baccalaureate students bound for graduate study. To forge links between experiment and theory, some students will perform experimental work and all will train within the PI's experimental/theoretical lab. Students will interact with theorists and experimentalists at other universities and undergraduate colleges. Lab and curricular enhancements will provide benefits beyond the term of the grant.

The main objective of the project is to explore the behavior of buoyant plumes released from a point source at the bottom of a stratified and rotating oceanic environment through large eddy simulations, as a step towards resolved modeling of oil and gas plumes in the future. <br/><br/>In particular, the following questions will be addressed:<br/>(i) What are the flow patterns of buoyant plumes in the presence of sub-mesoscale (spatial range of 100 m to 10 km, temporal range of few days to few weeks) oceanic environment? Does it show subsurface intrusions detraining from the main plume? How does the buoyant plume interact with mixed layer density fronts? What are the parameters controlling the plume?s ability to reach the surface? How much of the total discharge is expressed at the surface? <br/>(ii) What is the three-dimensional relative dispersion of the plume. How do surface and subsurface relative dispersion differ?<br/>(iii) What is the nature of dispersion of a three-dimensional buoyant plume after its source is shut down? How long does it take to dissipate? Where does it modify the surrounding water characteristics?<br/><br/>While this study will be conducted mainly within the context of a Boussinesq, Newtonian fluid model, two simple modifications will be considered. The first is the addition of evaporation to represent loss of volume over the first two days after surfacing, and the second one is the inclusion of non-Boussinesq effects in order to include density differences between oil and water of some 20%. The computations will be carried out employing the spectral element code Nek5000 in collaboration with Paul Fischer and Aleks Obabko on Argonne National Laboratory.?s IBM BL/G Intrepid machine on up to 32,000 CPUs. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Broader impacts of the project include a strengthening of the ongoing collaboration between scientists from the University of Miami, Argonne National Laboratory and the Naval Research Laboratory at Stennis Space Center to make progress in different aspects of the problem in preparation for future events. The results from this study may also lead to better sampling techniques of buoyant plumes and provide guidance on how to initialize larger scale ocean circulation models. It is also a good step for future development of advanced two-phase computational models for oil spill applications.

This project will investigate the ways that grassroots community organizations have tried to address long-standing impacts of racial violence in their communities through a focus on the Greensboro (North Carolina) Truth and Reconciliation Commission (GTRC).  The GTRC was formed in 2000 in response to the shooting of labor activists by individuals associated with the Ku Klux Klan in November 1979.  Those shootings occurred when labor organizers were holding a rally and conference at a local public housing project to protest Ku Klux Klan activities in the area.  As the rally progressed, some members of the local Klan arrived, and during the ensuing violence, five labor activists were killed and several more were wounded.  Despite the efforts of local prosecutors and extensive video evidence of the events, no one was ever held criminally liable for the deaths.  In 1999, local community organizers began advocating formation of a truth and reconciliation process modeled after commissions in South Africa and Peru.  The GTRC was assembled through a grassroots democratic process that sought to integrate a diverse community perspective.  In 2006, the GTRC released its report to the citizens of Greensboro.  Through a broadly conceived qualitative approach that will use open-ended interviews, archival research, and discourse analysis, this research project will explore the results of the GTRC, focusing on the ways that community members addressed the legacy and memory of violence and how violence continues to undergird racial exploitation and frame an understanding of difference in North America.  The majority of relevant research projects focusing on truth processes have examined them outside of a North American context.  The U.S. South is home to a nascent but growing movement to address inequality and legacies of violence through truth and reconciliation commissions, and the Greensboro example may serve as a model for other communities to follow in North America.<br/><br/>This project will explore the connections between the legacy of violence, race, and the construction of space to wider academic scrutiny.  It will assist in more fully examining the legacies of violence and race in North America.  The results of this project will contribute to larger discussions surrounding the impact that violence and race have in North American communities.  For example, the GTRC process may serve other communities who are grappling with the legacies of violence and who wish to create the geographic conditions necessary to accomplish racial reconciliation.  This project therefore will address the issue of racial violence at local, regional, national, and international scales and will contribute broadly to scholarship on race, violence, and space.

There has been a flurry of work on these and related pnictide superconductors (containing N, P or As) since then and the critical temperature (for operation) has been raised to 55 K. These materials are particularly interesting to the physics community because they have an intriguing combination of magnetic and superconducting properties, and they are of significance to the applied superconductivity community because they appear to have superconducting properties that may make them suitable for practical applications. However, practical applications require high-quality bulk material with clean, well-connected grain boundaries that allow supercurrent to move from grain to grain across the material. The bulk pnictide superconductors made today suffer from severely limiting current transport across grain boundaries due to multiphase mixtures that typically contain a Fe-As phase that covers the grain boundaries.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The intellectual merit of this project lies in investigating phase relations and reaction pathways to understand how to process pnictide superconductors to make high-quality bulk material that has clean, well-connected grain boundaries. Knowing what phases should be present in a sample (phase relations) and what phases are actually present (reaction pathways) guides the development of new heat treatments to make bulk samples. The resulting high-quality samples can be used to evaluate key bulk properties such as the critical current density in polycrystalline samples. This work investigates the Ba-Fe-As- Co system, which contains the Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 superconductor.  The broader impact of this research is to involve students and teachers in research on pnictide superconductors and expose lay audiences to the wonders of superconductivity and the world of superconductor processing. Specifically, Hellstrom continues to recruit summer students from underrepresented groups and to work with K-12 teachers during the summer. He also gives talks on superconductivity at the Rotary Club and other local civic organizations.

In nature, there appear to be no known elementary particles that are charged and massless. Photons, the quanta of light for example, are massless particles, but they have no electric charge. Recently, condensed matter physicists have uncovered a special class of materials whose charge carrying excitations behave as if they are massless particles. The electronic excitations in a two-dimensional, single atom thick sheet of carbon, known as graphene, behave like massless particles. Through the remarkable physics and chemistry of materials, the properties of massless and charged particles can be explored. These materials may be useful for future electronics device applications due to the properties of these intriguing particles. The PI aims to develop and use advanced theoretical techniques to further unlock the mysteries of graphene and to further understand the consequences of the unusual behavior of electrons in this and related materials. <br/><br/>The educational component of this proposal involves developing new wiki-based learning tools at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

The project could lead to commercial payoffs, anticipated to be disruptive to existing global electronic markets ensuring U.S. companies early entry market share and significant job creation. The successful implementation of the project will significantly and positively impact society's science and technology (S&T) communities, as well as address important socio-economic challenges related to increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The project's education and outreach goals are designed to address opportunities in establishing and implementing the STEM value pipeline. These goals are two-fold: i) to identify, recruit, retain, and educate students at the high school/middle school, undergraduate, and graduate levels in the fundamentals and applied aspects of magnetism, materials and technologies, and ii) to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the science and engineering professions, and in particular, in the magnetic materials and technology communities. The project's specific broader impact activities include the establishing of the Summer Science Magnetism Camp for rising 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade middle school students of the Roxbury Preparatory Charter School of Boston: A middle school having an overwhelming minority population (nearly 100%). This project addresses one aspect of the STEM value pipeline often overlooked, that is, the identification, recruitment and education of pre-high school students for careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: All single phase magnetoelectric materials reported to date function at cryogenic temperatures and/or very high magnetic fields severely limiting their utility. This research holds the potential of realizing practical materials that could be operated at room temperature and with minimal magnetic bias fields. Specifically, helical Y-type hexaferrite systems, including Ba2-xSrxZn2Fe12O22 and Ba2Zn2-xMgxFe12O22, have been shown to possess magnetoelectric properties, albeit at low temperatures (~5 K) or under high H-fields (~10 kOe).  In prior NSF-funded research, these PIs have demonstrated the ability to re-distribute cations among unit cell sublattices in ferrite materials by employing the alternating target laser ablation deposition technique. As a result, substantial enhancement of microwave and magnetic properties, such as increased saturation magnetization, magnetic anisotropy and NÈel temperature, has been demonstrated. Ab-initio electronic structure studies where used to guide the experimental research and to identify preferred sites for tailoring specific properties. This methodology, of targeted cation engineering, holds great promise for increasing the ferroelectric ordering temperature and reducing applied field requirements in hexaferrites. Combined with in-depth cation distribution studies, this research will yield new insights in effectively building the fundamental knowledge base of the magnetoelectric effect and it's potential applications. The project's broader impact activities include the establishment of the Summer Science Magnetism Camp for rising 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade middle school students of the Roxbury Preparatory Charter School of Boston. Additionally, graduate students will participate in all aspects of this project that will include first principles density functional theory, state-of-the-art thin film processing, and the application of advanced synchrotron radiation tools to predict and confirm cation unit cell distribution while introducing them to first hand experience at world leading national laboratories.

1001405	Studies in Representation Theory	DMS	ANALYSIS PROGRAM	07/01/2010	04/13/2012	Wilfried Schmid	MA	Harvard University	Continuing grant	Bruce P. Palka	06/30/2013	$180,012.00		schmid@math.harvard.edu	1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE	Cambridge	MA	021385369	6174955501	MPS	1281		$0.00	This proposal contains two separate strands, both connected to the representation theory of reductive Lie groups: the study of irreducible unitary representations of such groups, and functional equations of L-functions attached to automorphic representations. In collaboration with Kari Vilonen, Schmid shall apply M. Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules to the study of irreducible unitary representations; the objective is to derive criteria for unitarity. Schmid will continue his collaboration with Steve Miller. They will prove the regularity of L-functions, and derive functional equations, from the point of view of automorphic distributions, in cases that are inaccessible by other methods. Classical Fourier analysis is an absolutely fundamental tool for the study of functions of one or several real variables. In the 20th century, Fourier analysis was extended to abelian groups, compact groups, and finally to non-compact, non-abelian groups. Irreducible unitary representations constitute the basic building blocks of Fourier analysis. Although Harish-Chandra constructed enough irreducible unitary representations carry out Fourier analysis on reductive Lie groups, all irreducible unitary representations are necessary for Fourier analysis on quotient spaces of reductive Lie groups. Many partial results exist, but they do not fit into a coherent, general picture. Schmid and Vilonen recently formulated a far-reaching conjecture on the unitarity problem. Their aim is to verify the conjecture and to explore its various implications. Riemann's zeta function encodes deep properties of prime numbers, and Dirichlet L-functions do the same for primes in abelian extensions of the rational numbers. These functions are regular, except for certain well understood poles, have Euler products, and satisfy functional equations. Conjecturally Langlands L-functions play an analogous role for general number fields. They are defined in terms of Euler products, but their analytic properties are not obvious from the deØnition. Functional equations and regularity have been established in important special cases. Miller and Schmid expect their method to apply in several new cases, and also to simplify some existing arguments significantly. <br/><br/>Irreducible unitary representations of reductive groups play an important role in the Langlands program and other areas of number theory. The mathematical physics literature abounds with examples of irreducible unitary representation having various special properties. A more systematic approach to the classification of unitary representations would help to unify this aspect of mathematical physics. Vogan and his collaborators are working on a computer algorithm which would determine whether any specified representation is unitarizable. For some groups, for example E8, such an algorithm will severely strain existing computing facilities. The conjecture of Schmid and Vilonen has a direct bearing on this massive computational problem, by allowing to cut down signiØcantly on the number of cases that need to be checked. L-functions occupy a central place in algebraic and analytic number theory, and are now <br/>of interest also to cryptographers. This makes significant new results about L-functions useful to a large group of mathematicians, well beyond the community of experts on L-functions.

Current low-cost production methods for calcined clay and agricultural residue ash result in poor quality materials with low reactivity, limiting their use in construction.  This research aims to develop thermochemical treatments to align the optimum burning conditions of clay and agricultural residue to produce a more reactive supplementary cementitious material.  The specific research goals are as follows: 1) Quantify the change in optimum burning conditions and increased reactivity of calcined clays when flux additives are used, 2) Apply biomass pretreatments commonly used in biofuel production to agricultural residues to improve the quality of the ash for use in concrete, 3) Develop a methodology for combined calcined clay and agricultural residue ash production and use, and 4) Quantify the life cycle environmental benefit of the combined supplementary cementitious materials.<br/><br/>The replacement of high volumes of portland cement with the proposed combined calcined clay/agricultural residue ash material could greatly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with concrete construction and improve the quality of construction in developing countries since the proposed materials are low cost and widely available.  This multi-institution collaboration will provide interdisciplinary training in agricultural engineering, civil engineering, materials science, and life-cycle analysis and improved classroom instruction on infrastructure materials and sustainability.  A summer graduate student exchange will allow for improved collaboration and exposure to new equipment, research strategies, and laboratory methods.  An outreach program will also be developed to increase the participation of female and historically underrepresented students in engineering and sustainable development.

One project examines the evolution of spacetimes to see if the development of singularities that signal the breakdown of GR can occur in nature only inside black holes and, within black holes, can be visible only to observers who run into them. This is called the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. This question will be addressed through continued development of light≠cone≠ estimates for the Einstein equations that parallel those that have already been developed for the Yang-≠Mills-≠Higgs equations. The objective will be to show that space≠time curvature cannot blow up (point≠wise) in a (vacuum) solution to Einstein's equations until the integrated (Bel≠-Robinson) energy for curvature blows up. Another project will be to continue the development of improved numerical methods for the study of black hole collisions. Recent work has established the regularity of the (conformally transformed) ADM evolution equations at null infinity. This result and its potential generalizations will be applied to actual numerical calculations.<br/><br/>The cosmic censorship conjecture is often considered to be the main open mathematical problem in classical general relativity. Cosmic censorship is the natural analogue, for Einstein's equations, of the global existence property for Minkowski space field theories and so it seems very plausible that techniques that have proven successful in the analysis of the latter should have something important to contribute to the former. In addition, any significant progress on the development of improved numerical methods for the analysis of black hole collisions can be anticipated to strongly influence the ongoing worldwide efforts to numerically model these important astrophysical processes and ultimately to impact LIGO and LISA observations. Much of this research should be of interest to mathematicians. Development of improved numerical methods for the computation of gravitational waves from colliding black holes could have an impact on the experimental search for such radiation. Postdoctoral fellows and graduate students are expected to play key roles in these projects.
0968595	US-Brazil workshop on establishing Aves Internacionales, the first network on bird migration research in South America:  Campos do Jordao, Brazil, August 2010	OISE	Catalyzing New Intl Collab	07/01/2010	07/13/2011	Kimberly Smith	AR	University of Arkansas	Standard Grant	Harold Stolberg	06/30/2012	$59,962.00	Douglas Levey, Alex Jahn	kgsmith@uark.edu	210 Administration Building	FAYETTEVILLE	AR	727011201	4795753845	O/D	7299	5911, 5913, 5977	$0.00	Because migratory birds travel across political and cultural boundaries, their study and conservation requires collaboration between countries and cultures. Such collaboration is now commonplace in the Northern Hemisphere, but it has lagged behind in South America due to obstacles in communication, lack of standardization, and lack of funds.  To overcome these obstacles and catalyze international research on bird migration in South America, this award supports a workshop to form the Aves Internacionales Network (in Portuguese: Rede Aves Internacionais; in Spanish: Red Aves Internacionales).  The workshop, which is co-organized by Miguel Marini of the Universidade de Brasilia (Brazil), Victor Cueto of the Universidad de Buenos Aires (Argentina), and Ana Maria Mamani of the Museo de Historia Natural Noel Kempff Mercado (Bolivia), will coincide with the 25th International Ornithological Congress (IOC) in Campos do Jord„o, Brazil, in August 2010.  Research topics generated by workshop participants will center around two interrelated goals: (1) developing hypotheses on bird migration in South America and collecting data to test those hypotheses, and (2) testing hypotheses on how bird migration differs in South and North America.  In combination, these two goals will provide a new, geographically broader perspective about how and why New World birds migrate.  <br/><br/>This workshop aims to develop a research agenda based on questions that cannot be answered by any single research group, but which require international collaboration across North and South America.  Participants will be drawn from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and the United States, and will include active members of MIGRATE, a NSF-funded program to study migration in the Northern Hemisphere. Many of the workshop participants will be students or young professionals, personally committed to fostering long-term partnerships with international colleagues.  The workshop will contribute to knowledge about socially relevant issues such as climate change, land-use patterns, and the avian spread of diseases, and will also generate a series of education-based activities in both North and South America.

Campbell Rd., AD15	Richardson	TX	750803021	9728832313	GEO	1572	0000	$0.00	Northwesterly displacement of the Sierra Nevada with respect to the Great Basin in the western US Cordillera has been ongoing for the last 12 to 15 Ma.  This motion is accommodated by a complicated and incompletely understood belt of deformation along the western margin of the Great Basin that links major, misaligned strike-slip faults in eastern California and western Nevada.  Based on previous research and our preliminary work, we have identified that the deformed belt underlies a region of nearly 15,000 km2 and contains large tectonic blocks that both translate toward the northwest as the crust is pulled apart and also undergo vertical-axis rotations of 20∞ to 90∞.  In this project, we will provide a better understanding of the dimensions of the tectonic blocks, how far they have moved laterally, to what degree they experienced vertical-axis rotation, and the spatial-temporal pattern of deformation.  Much of the western borderland of North America and many parts of other continents around the world reside in similar tectonic settings and record comparable histories of deformation.  This study will provide the opportunity to better understand how and to what degree the translation and rotation of large crustal blocks is accommodated as the continental crust is fragmented in response to the relative movement of lithospheric plates.<br/><br/><br/>Crustal response to displacement transfer in structural stepovers linking misaligned segments of large-magnitude transcurrent faults is accommodated by components of translational and rotational displacement and strain and results in complex three-dimensional arrays of structures.  The mechanisms by which rotational and translational strain are accommodated either by rigid-blocks and/or by distributed strain and to what degree the translational and rotational processes are coupled in space-time are poorly understood.  In this study, we integrate detailed and regional geologic mapping with thermochronologic, structural, and paleomagnetic analysis to unravel the history of transcurrent structures separating the Sierra Nevada and central Great Basin.  The objective of the work is to characterize transcurrent and high-angle normal fault displacement, estimate slip on low-angle detachment faults, and assess the relation between translational deformation and differential rotation.  Our research results will provide the needed detailed understanding of the spatial and temporal pattern of deformation and supply the constraints to differentiate between coeval and serial translational and rotational deformation histories within the stepover system and provide the means to assess whether or to what degree rotation is accommodated by rigid-body motion or distributed strain processes.<br/>

The ICN is the scientific meeting of the International Society for Neuroethology (ISN) that has been held since 1986.  This meeting brings together diverse neuroscientists who investigate the neural basis of behavior across a broad spectrum of animals.  It is an outstanding venue to bring together international scientists with a broad range of perspectives, but who all focus on common basic-science questions that have important implications for neural function.  Topics include sensory and motor processing, central integrative processes, development, synaptic plasticity and learning, regeneration, and systems-level approaches to understanding plasticity and behavior.  In addition some sessions focus on emerging technologies. Neuroethology aims to explain natural behaviors in terms of the activity of individual neurons and networks, and to explore developmental and evolutionary aspects of behavior. Neuroethologists use a comparative approach to seek common solutions to common problems.  This involves an understanding of evolutionary principles as they apply to nervous systems and the generation of adaptive behaviors.  Evolutionarily informed comparisons of equivalent behaviors in different species can help to identify the common principles that guide the generation of behavior in all species, including humans. The broader impacts of this meeting are to promote engagement in this area for junior investigators, and in particular women and minority scientists, and to stimulate cross-fertilization of ideas among the participants. Support will be directed to fund travel and registration for student, postdoctoral and junior investigators.  The benefits to American scientists in general, and to young investigators in particular, will be the opportunity for exposure to cutting-edge research and techniques from around the world.
0948562	Collaborative Research: Toward an Understanding of the Long-Term Deformation in the Mississippi Embayment - Phase II	EAR	TECTONICS	07/01/2010	04/03/2012	Kirk McIntosh	TX	University of Texas at Austin	Continuing grant	David Fountain	06/30/2014	$315,943.00		kirk@ig.utexas.edu	3925 West Braker Lane, Ste 11072	Austin	TX	787595316	5124716424	GEO	1572	1576	$0.00	Capitalizing on the success of a pilot study conducted in 2008, which tested the feasibility of marine seismic data acquisition along the Mississippi River, University of Memphis and University of Texas researchers are planning two field programs to acquire approximately 600 km of high-resolution, marine seismic reflection and sub-bottom profile data along the Mississippi River. The two campaigns will image with unprecedented resolution the New Madrid Seismic Zone active fault system and a series of inferred faults suspected to be responsible for earthquake induced liquefaction features predating the seismic activity of the New Madrid Seismic Zone. Exploiting the advantages of marine acquisition (time effective, low cost), the new data will identify the location and timing of deformation within the active fault system (which generates more than 200 magnitude 1.5-4.0 earthquakes a year), and outside the New Madrid Seismic Zone, and contribute to the understanding of how long-term deformation is partitioned in time and space among faults within the Mississippi Embayment. This information is critical to solve the apparent paradox raised by the contrasting evidence of small geodetic vectors, a puzzling lack of substantial deformation, and the high level of instrumental and historical seismicity. <br/><br/>One of the pillars of plate tectonics is the assumption of the rigidity of major plates. Indeed GPS studies show that most plate interiors behave rigidly and, as a result, the majority of earthquakes occur along narrow or diffuse belts at plate boundaries. Located in the heart of the North American continent and 2,000 km away from the nearest plate boundary, the New Madrid Seismic Zone is one of the most active intraplate seismic areas in the world, and one of the most notorious deviations from plate rigidity. Paleoseismological observations show that the area experienced a series of catastrophic earthquakes in historic and prehistoric time and evidence is mounting that the long-term seismicity is not limited to the presently active fault system, but that large earthquakes have occurred in other areas within the Mississippi Embayment, for which the responsible fault (or system of faults) are yet to be identified. This study will provide observational constraints on theoretical models proposed to explain the timing, magnitude and location of intraplate seismicity in the Central United States. The results of this project will also have a crucial impact for earthquake hazard assessments by localizing and characterizing seismogenic faults, and improving the quality and usefulness of seismic hazard maps.

Conceptual and numerical models of abrupt changes and the role of high vs. low latitudes as the drivers of climate change invoke sea ice as a principle cause of variability, but to date there have been no reliable proxies of past sea ice extent. Understanding the role of sea ice in past changes also critically impacts our understanding of the consequences of future changes in Arctic sea ice cover. This research calibrates and applies a set of new organic biomarkers (IP25 sea ice index, and TEX86 temperature index) to reconstruct changes in sea ice and associated sea surface temperatures from a series of high sedimentation rate cores from the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Specifically, the researchers will 1) produce a high latitude spatial dataset of relative IP25 concentrations and compare the distribution of these compounds with modern sea ice extent, 2) generate a new database of biomarker distributions in surface sediments from high-latitude oceans and compare with known SST variations, and 3) reconstruct past changes in seasonal sea ice and associated sea surface temperatures during the late glacial and Holocene from selected high latitude sites. In addition to the societal relevance of better understanding the role of sea ice extent in climate change, broader impacts include support of a PhD student, summer research projects for undergraduates, and a new faculty member at the University of Texas at Austin.
0964692	Physics Modeling of Solar Wind Driven Storms and Substorms in the Earth's Magnetosphere-Ionosphere System	AGS	MAGNETOSPHERIC PHYSICS	06/15/2010	05/14/2012	Wendell Horton	TX	University of Texas at Austin	Continuing grant	Raymond J.

It will extend the mathematical model called WINDMI to describe the storage and release of energy in multiple reservoirs for plasma trapped in the magnetosphere. It will develop a theoretical description for the dynamics of the supersonic solar wind plasma energy, through the magnetosphere to the high-density cold ionospheric plasma. The model will be by projecting the ideal MHD continuum equations and the more accurate kinetic theory equations onto the currents and plasma components of the driven magnetospheric magnetic components. The projections will lead to a set of coupled differential equations for the key plasma currents, densities, and temperatures. New physics components will be developed for the dayside of the magnetosphere. The dayside physics has a collisionless bow shock that reduces the supersonic flow to subsonic, while compressing the plasma and the embedded interplanetary magnetic field. A complex set of plasma currents control the plasmas in the magnetosphere and in the magnetopause boundary layer. The model will use kinetic theory calculations to describe the boundary layers and the mechanism for how the plasma is heated. The model will integrate diverse aspects of the plasma physics of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system and use scientific computing to derive real-time dynamics for the system. The model will predict the magnetic field that are used to define magnetic storms and substorms. These predictions will be compared with observations to validate the model. <br/> <br/>The research is of intrinsic scientific interest in its investigation of the interaction of supersonic plasma winds with dipole magnetic obstacles. It also has societal relevance by providing a new tool for forecasting the occurrence of dangerous space weather storms.  Much of the research will be performed by graduate students and the project therefore has significant educational benefits.

The NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center (NWSC) will house massively parallel petascale computers and mass data storage archives that will enable researchers in the geosciences to achieve dramatic increases in the resolution of Earth System Science models, improve the representations of modeled physical processes, run model simulations covering longer periods of time and produce better statistics. Regional climate simulations with nested grids at meteorological resolutions will become feasible, enabling scientists to investigate the connection between climate and hurricane frequency and strength, study the localized effects of regional climate change on agriculture and water supplies, and investigate numerous other computationally demanding Earth System processes.<br/><br/>The proposed facility will have the power, space, and cooling capacity to support a 1.0 to 1.5 petaflops peak system with an expected data production rate of 23-35 petabytes per year by 2012. This will provide a 15- to 20-fold increase over computing resources currently available to the community at NCAR. This system will be integrated with the cyberinfrastructure (CI) of NSF's TeraGrid eXtreme Digital (XD), the Track-1 'Blue Waters' system, and the DataNet program. The facility will be well connected to computing facilities operated by other Federal agencies such as DOE, NOAA, and NASA as well as high-performance computing systems located at colleges and universities. The NWSC will be a showcase of sustainable design and construction, and will be a world-leader in energy-efficient cyberinfrastructure. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of the proposed work include the deployment of high-performance CI within the NWSC that will enable researchers to perform high-resolution simulations of weather phenomena, global and regional climate, coastal oceans, sunspots, subsurface flow, and more. Earth System research and education will be transformed by the NWSC, as the next generation of Earth science researchers and computational scientists will be attracted by the importance of the problem and the scale of the facilities available to them. Current and planned education, outreach, and training programs built around the facility will help to broaden the impact of the NWSC project on both regional and national scales. Integration of the NWSC with other NSF high-performance CI will provide important linkages with other resource providers and will directly support NSF's vision of a transformative national petascale cyberinfrastructure for science and engineering. Finally, the NWSC has the potential to contribute to economic development in the State of Wyoming in the form of well-paying jobs, workforce training opportunities, and in the transformation of the state into a destination of choice for other high-technology enterprises. Through the facility partnership with Wyoming, these benefits can be extended to other EPSCoR states as well.

Mixing by internal waves is thought to be a primary mechanism governing the overall thermohaline structure of the oceans, and may have significant implications for climate variability. The project promises to reduce the uncertainty in climate prediction associated with the smallest scale physical processes that cannot be explicitly solved by climate models. The project will address three aspects of ocean mixing: near field mixing at internal wave generation sites, mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy transported in the wave field, and far field mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy away from sources. Parameterizations will be based on data-based relations for wave physics, radiation balance theory, and results from process models. In addition to be being based on sound theoretical ideas, the parameterizations will also be based on observational results from the growing data set of microstructure observations.

There is also a long-term trend towards less severe armed conflicts, though climate change threatens to reverse this favorable trend. Rising in temperatures are likely to cause drought and increase natural hazards (including floods and hurricanes).  Resulting migration and in turn, conflict with host communities can lead to local scarcities, increasing the risk of conflict. Climate change will possibly weaken politically-unstable regimes in low-development countries, in turn strengthening the hand of insurgent movements challenging governments and adding to communal conflict. The PIs will look at specific physical phenomena (droughts and natural hazards) whose social and economic effects will then be traced to estimate the probable implications for conflict. The projected impacts of climate change will not result in elevated conflict risk in all societies but depends on country-specific and contextual factors.  The investigation will take place at two scales, the regional and the local, for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  Using a predictive model of the coupled natural (climate) and social (violence) systems, with feedback loops and mediating socio-political-economic variables, the PIs will measure the impact of adverse climate change and/or changes in climate variability on the rate of armed conflict, determine which mediating factors influence the rate of this impact, and project the violence outcomes on the basis of different climate change/variability scenarios. The data from the substantial climate, satellite imaged environmental (land-use), socio-economic and violence sources will be integrated in a geographic information system, with 100 kilometers grids being the primary scale of analysis. Local studies in selected contexts in East Africa (with the support of local research networks) will complement the statistical study by exploring the locally-varying processes linking climate/environmental change to violent events.<br/><br/>Efforts to assess the security implications of climate change have foundered on the paucity of empirical evidence and the lack of consensus in the scientific literature of the extent of the possible relationship. Recent statements by U.S. and international agencies propose climate change/variability as a threat multiplier to existing problems (poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership, and weak political institutions) that might threaten domestic stability in weak states.  Possible impacts of climate change/variability are mediated by contextual conditions, especially governmental policies, socio-economic resources, and existing fractures along regional and ethnic lines.  Sub-Saharan Africa has been identified as the most vulnerable region, with the possibility of significant intra-regional migration/emigration to escape a worsening quality of life leading to communal conflict over declining resources. The research will contribute to policy debates within the US and internationally which, to date, have skirted the issue due to unreliable conflict measures, debatable climate change indicators, information on local differences, and the lack of contact between the natural/climate science and conflict studies communities.
0961825	RUI: River and sediment-modulated stress in planktonic and early settlement Mya arenaria	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	06/01/2010	06/02/2010	Mark Green	ME	Saint Joseph's College	Standard Grant	David L.

They are typically less buffered to acid than open oceans due to the combined effects of acid production during heterotrophy and acidic inputs from both land and atmosphere. Within estuaries, it is important to understand how varying acid burdens impact living resources, particularly those that provide ecosystem services and/or generate income as fisheries. The bivalve Mya arenaria, the focal species of this proposed research, is one such resource that sustains a valuable coastal fishery while providing service via its filtration capacity. Because Mya shells are constructed from a relatively soluble form of calcium carbonate (aragonite), and the clams often inhabit eutrophic waters, they may be particularly vulnerable as pH declines. Planktonic larvae and benthic juveniles are critical life stages -- even small reductions in theier abundances could substantially decrease adult populations. <br/><br/>This proposed research addresses four distinct hypotheses concerning the roles of riverine and sediment interactions on the viability of larval and juvenile Mya. Research activities include the following. <br/><br/>1. Fieldwork will evaluate the spatial and seasonal changes in aragonite saturation state within the Kennebec River Estuary and Casco Bay. Seasonal sampling will be coupled with high-frequency sampling during the annual Mya spawn to observe and document the effect of lowered aragonite saturation state on the health status of larval Mya. <br/><br/>2. Using larval Mya, laboratory experiments will mimic the aragonite saturation state observed in Casco Bay during the high-frequency cruises. Metamorphic change (veligers, pediveligers, and metamorphosed juveniles), growth rate, and survivorship of Mya will be evaluated as a function of aragonite saturation state. <br/><br/>3. Spatially intensive daily cohort monitoring of the intertidal mud flats in Falmouth, Maine, will establish the link between changes in abundance of settling juveniles and aragonite saturation state during the period of Mya set. Cohort monitoring of settling Mya will be examined in reference to sediment pH and aragonite saturation state in nearby deposits to ascertain if sediment saturation state is a primary settlement cue for transitioning larvae. <br/><br/>4. A diagnostic model will be developed for the shellfish management community that can be used to detect aragonite saturation state of the water column. The model would run on routine oceanographic measurements (salinity, temperature, oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence). <br/><br/>Intellectual merit of study: The chemical consequences of increasing atmospheric CO2 and resulting hydrolysis of carbonic acid is well understood and resultant ocean acidification has been accurately predicted with the current generation of global circulation models. These predictions have accelerated research into the effects of ocean acidification on marine organisms, particularly those with CaCO3 exoskeletons. Estuarine waters are far less buffered than oceans, are subject to a variety of acid loadings, and are quite possibly acidifying at a faster rate than the open ocean. Yet, these regions have been largely ignored in 'acidification' research.  Effects of acidification on calcifying organisms are similar regardless of whether of acid origin -- atmospheric exchange, net heterotrophy, or discharge of acidic river water. Likewise, each of these acid fluxes is being perturbed via anthropogenic activity (e.g. fossil fuel use, deforestation, agriculture). The proposed research will further understanding of the combined and cumulative impacts of varied acid burdens on calcifying organisms in coastal waters. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of study: Saint Joseph's College of Maine is an undergraduate institution with many potential opportunities to introduce students to the excitement of scientific research and discovery. This project will have special significance to the 70% of women that make up the student body at Saint Joseph's College, many of whom will experience research science for the first time. The immersion of students into research will be modeled after other sponsored research at SJC, resulting in a new marine science major, in over 35 SJC undergraduates attending and/or presenting research results at national/international conferences (12 as co-authors), and in 4 students co-authoring recent papers for publication.

Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-507.  The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. <br/> <br/>This project proposal focuses on autonomic computing and systems, applicable to the important areas of security, fault management, and data centers. Planned are the prototypes to be deployed on test bed environments driven by the requirements from industry. The most interesting part of the proposal are applications to SCADA environments, which integrate monitoring, multi-level behavior analysis, decision fusion and risk analysis relative to security of SCADA environments. Other areas include autonomic peer-to-peer systems, as well as study related to the data centers, both at the application layer and data center hardware, where focus is on robustness.<br/><br/>The successful completion of this project will represent a significant step toward the design and deployment of highly secure SCADA systems and networks. In addition to security, the autonomic detection of anomalies in applications or subsystems of a datacenter addresses inefficiencies in data center design by eliminating the dependence on over-provisioning, which is a resource-inefficient strategy for ensuring quality of service by trying to offset any sub-system failures and malfunctions. The project has also potential for broader impact on data-intensive applications that leverage the availability of ad-hoc desktop grids for high-throughput computing.
0961707	A General Theory of Matching Estimation	SES	ECONOMICS, METHOD, MEASURE & STATS	06/15/2010	05/04/2015	Alberto Abadie	MA	National Bureau of Economic Research Inc	Continuing grant	Kwabena Gyimah-Brempong	05/31/2016	$380,500.00	Guido Imbens	abadie@mit.edu	1050 Massachusetts Avenue	Cambridge	MA	021385398	6178683900	SBE	1320, 1333	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This research project encompasses two distinct but closely related projects. Both deal with statistics methods for estimating causal effects in settings with binary treatments: units either receive one of two levels of a treatment, and one is interested in the difference in average outcomes under these two levels of the treatment.  In many observational (non-randomized) studies, researchers attempt to estimate causal effects by comparing outcomes for pairs of units, one treated and one not treated, with identical similar values for observed pre-treatment variables.  The key assumption is that after eliminating differences in outcomes due to differences in covariates, the remaining differences can be attributed to the causal effect of the treatment.  Implementing such matching estimators can be difficult if there are many covariates.  A seminal paper by Rosenbaum and Rubin (Biometrika, 1984) shows that in settings with multiple covariates matching on a scalar function of these covariates, the propensity score, can eliminate all biases associated with differences in covariates.  This method has been widely applied.  In settings where the propensity score is unknown, however, the asymptotic distribution for the matching estimator has not been derived.  In fact, it has been shown that commonly used methods for constructing confidence intervals based on resampling methods such as the bootstrap are not valid.  The researchers will develop statistical methods that allow them to derive the asymptotic distribution for matching estimators where the matching is on the estimated propensity score.  They will develop and exploit a new martingale representation for matching estimators, and show that this sheds new light on their asymptotic distribution.  The investigators will then show how to use this representation to derive the asymptotic distribution for the case of matching on the propensity score. Given the widespread use of this matching method, these results will be useful to<br/>practitioners.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Matching estimators are often used to evaluate the effectiveness of public interventions. As a result, valid inferential tools for matching estimators are likely to have substantial impact in empirical practice. This project will produce freely available software to implement the proposed methods.
0955967	CAREER: The Influence of Distributed River Inputs and Coastal Embayments on Dynamics in Large Estuaries	OCE	PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY, EDUCATION/HUMAN RESOURCES,OCE	06/15/2010	05/07/2017	Michael Whitney	CT	University of Connecticut	Continuing grant	Eric C.

Storrs	CT	062691133	8604863622	GEO	1610, 1690	1045, 1187	$0.00	The project is designed to transform the understanding of the effects of distributed rivers and coastal embayments on dynamics in large estuaries like the Long Island Sound (LIS). The hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Wind-driven and tidal straining of across-estuary density gradients is quantitatively as large as straining of along-estuary gradients; 2) Distributed river inputs create focused areas of increased straining and areas of reversed straining conditions; 3) During storm response, smaller river inputs from coastal watersheds collectively have a first-order influence on circulation and density structure; 4) River waters follow regular transport pathways that shift during wind events; 5) Coastal embayments transition from areas of net mixing to increased stratification as tidal currents decrease along the estuary. The hydrodynamic simulations for the LIS will be coupled to a surface-runoff model for coastal watersheds. Straining conditions and the combined influence of the smaller river inflows will be studied to determine the transport pathways for fresh water from the distributed river inputs and quantify the effects of coastal embayments on estuarine circulation and density structure.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed modeling research will transform the understanding of dynamics in large estuaries. The study will advance the understanding of how fresh water from multiple sources combines to determine estuary density fields; tracking these separate inputs also informs the study of riverine nutrient, contaminant, and carbon inputs to estuaries. The research will extend the study of estuarine density straining to large estuaries where a 3D approach is necessary and spatial variations in straining conditions are pronounced. Inputs from distributed smaller rivers from coastal watersheds will be accurately represented using a coupled surface-runoff model and an input method consistent with potential energy considerations. This study will quantify the effects of these smaller distributed rivers and coastal embayments on large-scale estuarine dynamics. The new coupled modeling approach and analysis techniques will increase the ability to model present and future estuarine conditions. The integrated multi-faceted education and outreach effort each year will inform several hundred K-12 students, undergraduates, graduate students, and the general public on estuarine dynamics, storm response, and research results. The main message that nearby rivers and embayments have far-reaching effects should foster interest in and encourage stewardship of the coastal watersheds and estuaries.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will train a post-doctoral researcher and undergraduate student for careers in scientific research and education. Undergraduate and graduate students will be educated by the new 'Freshwater Transport and Mixing' course. Summer undergraduate interns will gain vital research experience. Several hundred students reached by the K-12 education and outreach efforts, through the Project Oceanology field education program and the annual 'Meet Your Estuary Day' for lower-income and minority students, will gain an understanding of the interconnectedness of watersheds and estuaries and a new interest in studying and protecting coastal waters. The new college course and the new Project Oceanology learning module developed will continue beyond the project span; adding to the project?s educational legacy. Research findings will inform research for large estuaries and compliment research on environmental issues facing LIS and other estuaries. This project will inform biogeochemical research on multiple riverine inputs of nutrients, pollutants, and carbon to estuarine systems. The coupling techniques combining the surface-runoff and hydrodynamic models will be shared with the coastal modeling community. Results will be published in scientific journals and presented at conferences. The program will improve the scientific infrastructure at the University of Connecticut and will improve partnerships between the university, Project Oceanology, Connecticut Sea Grant and other organizations.

Bacteria are ideal systems for many microbiorobotic systems, because of the ease of their ?gproduction and refueling?h. For this purpose, microbiorobots (MBRs) are constructed, which consist of flagellated bacteria integrated with fabricated microstructures. The bacterial cells propel the microstructures in fluidic environments.  In this project, some design aspects for the MBRs are explored, including the effects of bacterial density, distribution and orientation on the surface of the MBRs, as well as various modalities to control the bacteria. A number of stimuli, including ultraviolet light, electromagnetic field, chemicals, and thermal stimuli are used as control inputs to the MBRs, while measurement feedback is provided by a computer vision-based system. Deliverables include mathematical models of the system behavior, experimental results on the bacteria morphology, microscopy visualization, prototypical demonstration of motion control, documentation of research results, engineering student education, and engineering research experiences for high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>If successful, the outcome of this research will represent a critical step toward understanding how to control bacterial propulsion systems to manipulate larger engineered elements, for example in microassembly and micromanipulation scenarios. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit from this project through classroom instruction and involvement in the research.  The program will also be integrated with various outreach activities, including (i) microbiorobotics workshops at Drexel and RPI, (ii) active recruitment and training of women and under?]represented minority engineers by leveraging and expanding existing and proven programs already in place at Drexel and RPI, (iii) outreach to high school students and teachers at RPI, and (iv) interactive web?]based tutorials and exhibits.
1009453	Dynamics of Light Interacting with Active Media	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS, DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS	07/01/2010	06/17/2010	Gregor Kovacic	NY	Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute	Standard Grant	Lora Billings	06/30/2014	$202,827.00		kovacg@rpi.edu	110 8TH ST	Troy	NY	121803522	5182766000	MPS	1266, 7478	7237	$0.00	This work will address mathematical descriptions of the dynamics arising in three novel effects generated by the interaction of light with an optical medium in the lambda- configuration.  The first is random polarization switching of light pulses propagating through a lambda-configuration medium, whose description gives rise to the rare combination of a simultaneously completely integrable and stochastic partial differential equation.  The second is the light stopping phenomenon, which requires the development of a new inverse-scattering-transform technique and soliton theory for the Maxwell-Bloch equations with nonvanishing boundary conditions at infinity. The third is light propagating through a combined, lambda-configuration metamaterial, which requires the derivation of a new model to be studied through a combination of exact solutions, asymptotic, and numerical techniques, and may give rise to descriptions of novel phenomena such as simultaneous color and direction switching and a related nonlinear version of Anderson localization, as well as mechanisms for loss compensation in metamaterials.   More broadly, the work will advance the theory of completely-integrable systems, and especially a successful description of loss compensation in metamaterials, may have impact on practical nonlinear optics. Interdisciplinary training in applied mathematics and nonlinear optics will be provided to graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Interaction between light and active optical media (these are media for which such interaction is particularly strong) is one of the most fruitful areas in applied physics and provides the basic mechanism underlying devices such as lasers and optical amplifiers.   It has continued to be a rich source of new physical phenomena, among the latest being light stopping, during which specially prepared optical pulses are slowed down to a fraction of the light speed, and which could be used in designing optical memory.   In addition, this interaction could also be used to reduce losses in optical metamaterials (artificial nano-composites with previously unattainable optical properties such as perfect lens focusing) and thus help advance their development from the current proof-of-concept experiments to eventual practical optical devices.   Due to the great variety of physical phenomena it exhibits, light interaction with active media has also given rise to a broad range of mathematical descriptions of their dynamics.  Three novel such mathematical descriptions will be developed in the course of this work, including those of stopped light, a certain potential type of loss compensation in a metamaterial, and finally a rare exact description of light propagating through a highly disordered medium.

Ultra Wide Band radio is a promising technology for intra-vehicle wireless control and communications applications since it is capable of achieving high-speed and robust transmissions within a short distance.  However, in-vehicle channels introduce dense and extended multi-path components into received signals, and are sensitive to the movement of drivers and passengers. Hence existing Ultra Wide Band technologies need to be redesigned when applied to an in-vehicle environment.  This collaborative project firstly addresses the differential code shifted reference technology to capture more signal energy without performing channel estimation leading to an enhanced bit-error rate performance in a low complexity.  Secondly, cognitive Ultra Wide Band radio will be used to proactively eliminate various in-band narrowband interferences. Finally, intra-vehicle control and communications systems necessitate an innovative research strategy and design methodology in order to meet the requirement on the coexistence of reliable real-time control message delivery and high-speed date communications.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This collaborative project will improve the education quality of electrical engineering and technology programs by involving undergraduate and graduate students and will attract students, especially those from minority groups, to the fields of science, mathematics, engineering, and technology through seminars and demonstrations.  Moreover, the research will help American automotive companies become the worldwide leaders in intra-vehicle wireless control and communications applications, save costs up to billions of dollars per year, enhance the reliability of American made vehicles, offer customers attractive features for informatics and entertainments, and ultimately boost the sales of American automotive products.  Lastly, the outcomes of the research can be easily extended to other American industrial sectors, and hence increase the high-tech ingredient of American industry.

It is then hard to use with previous projects.<br/>- The task of event determination and feature classification is onerous and we don't do it until after we get the data.<br/><br/>These statements point to the lack of a comprehensive, re-useable data ingest framework that consists of a semantically rich set of annotations along the data ingest workflow and a smart storage, propagation and retrieval mechanism for the provenance and derivation information. For the purpose of this project, provenance is defined as: the origin or source from which something comes, its intention for use, who/what is was generated for, its manner, sense of place, and time of manufacture, production or discovery, history of subsequent owners, and documented in detail sufficient to allow reproducibility. Thus, the goal of this project is to provide an extensible representation for provenance for data ingest systems.  Initially, we limit our focus to the set of solar coronal physics instruments operated at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory in Hawaii by the High Altitude Observatory, National Center for Atmospheric Research.  Over time, we will target the broader area of solar and solar-terrestrial physics, including the proposed Coronal Solar Magnetism Observatory. This project leverages innovative work with the Inference Web explanation framework which provides a set of tools for generating, validating, manipulating, summarizing, and presenting knowledge provenance. In addition we will utilize its Interlingua for provenance, justification, and trust representation - PML - the Proof Markup Language.<br/><br/>Two important concepts to be captured are the data quality and nature of the processing stages that the data has passed through. Both qualitative and quantitative encodings of data quality are very important to a scientist determining if the data of interest are useful, applicable or accurate enough for the intended use.<br/><br/>The provenance work will have broad applicibility since it will include domain-independent portions geared for any data ingest system as well as a domain-literate module aimed at solar and solar-terrestrial physics. This project is expected to generate a science-driven extension to PML that will provide representational primitives required for scientific provenance. The project will also contribute to community standards by adding meta data to ontologies developed in related projects with a wide degree of applicability to similar community and government programs.<br/>

PROJECT SUMMARY: During the last few months, we have discovered that all recent experimental and modeling work on the production of valuable pharmaceutical powders (insulin, antibiotics, anti-virals, cortisones,..) was not exploiting or even taking into account a rather basic phenomenon that could lead to very significant future product/process improvements. Our preliminary calculations revealed that if sufficiently small solvent droplets could be sprayed into supercritical CO2 anti-solvent? the ensuing dilation rate would actually be large enough to dramatically reduce the coagulation rate constant and narrow the PSD of precipitating particles in this unusual particle processing environment!<br/>EAGER Program Objectives: The purpose of this 1-year Early Concept/Exploratory Research(EAGER) Grant application to NSF-CBET is to enable our immediate exploration/evaluation of this exciting new research direction.  Not one of the many other groups worldwide (often affiliated with Chemistry departments) has even considered this interesting type of coupling [between homogeneous kinetics and fluid deformation rate], not to mention the possible practical implications for pharma particle production using more advanced injectors---ie, producing smaller solvent droplet diameters (ca. sub 10-micron) to exploit these predicted benefits.<br/>Intellectual Merit: Our brief initial quantitative account of this potentially transformative discovery, along with our preliminary calculations already demonstrating its remarkable PSD-consequences. This present EAGER Program will allow us to immediately develop this initial discovery into a more general process modeling approach, even enabling inclusion of the effects of other potentially important types of solvent non-uniformities (eg., spatial gradients) on coagulation rate constants, including the effects of net particle charge and fluid temperature non-uniformity.<br/>Uniqueness of Approach: Because of our unusual interdisciplinary backgrounds (embracing ChE, Fluid Physics, Mech E, and AeroE) we are in a unique position to investigate this exciting new class of possibilities, and then move on (via a 3-year follow-on NSF/CBET Grant) to improve the modeling of several other key aspects of the attractive supercritical fluid particle processing environment. <br/>Broader Impacts: The intellectual and economic impact of this work via its effect on future modeling efforts in the many SCF-based industries (pharma-, catalyst synthesis, energetic materials, food technologies,) already exploiting supercritical fluids is likely to be very significant----especially as a result of our university lectures, talks at international conferences (2010 IAC, and AIChE) and universities, provisional patent disclosure, and, of course, our archival publications,

LUX-350 promises substantially improved sensitivity to the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), a theoretically attractive explanation for the nature of the missing dark matter. LUX-350 is a two-phase (liquid/gas) xenon experiment, with a total liquid xenon (LXe) mass of 350 kg and a fiducial mass of 100 kg. The LUX-350 detector exploits a number of features of LXe to drive backgrounds down. The active detector volume permits the full reconstruction of event energy deposition and position. Crucially, the background rate is heavily suppressed in the fiducial volume due to the active shielding by the surrounding LXe, and decreases with increasing LXe mass. Integration of LUX-350 will take place at a newly renovated surface facility at SUSEL, the Sanford Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory at Homestake before moving underground.<br/><br/>On LUX-350, Yale is responsible for the xenon purification system, the 100 kV cathode high voltage system, slow control electronics, and radioactive source manipulators for detector calibration. The group has also developed a method of calibrating LXe detectors using Kr-83 atoms dissolved in the LXe, and performed a new measurement of the scintillation efficiency and charge yield for nuclear recoils in LXe. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Development of technology related to LXe will find use in the increasing number of experiments worldwide using noble liquids as detection materials. These projects will also result in technical training in radiation detection, cryogenics, and gas purification for graduate and undergraduate students. LXe has practical applications to gamma ray imaging for astrophysics, Homeland Security, and medical imaging, as well as for fast neutron detection.

Charles Ying	06/30/2013	$337,488.00	Frederick Walker	charles.ahn@yale.edu	Office of Sponsored Projects	New Haven	CT	065208327	2037854689	MPS	1775	6863, 9161, AMPP	$0.00	Technical: The goal of the project is to control and manipulate polarization and electric fields at interfaces of crystalline oxides and semiconductor material. Key to achieving this goal is atomic level control of the microscopic form and structure of the interface, which requires advanced oxide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth techniques. The research requires specialized characterization tools to probe buried epitaxial interfaces with the highest reciprocal space resolution, including high speed methods of measuring the crystal truncation rods of interface structures using synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Other physical and electrical structure characterization techniques include in-situ electrical transport measurements, in-situ surface diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The PIs combine these synthesis and characterization tools to develop new functional behavior in three specific areas: band offsets (interface dipoles), interface polarization, and single layer interface ferroelectrics. Each research direction is focused on a materials system suited to the relevant property under investigation: BaO for band offsets, SrTiO3 for interface polarization, and MX2-type layered films for ferroelectricity. The research addresses the fundamentals of how form (structure) affects function (electrical properties) at crystalline oxide-semiconductor interfaces. By considering crystalline oxides, one can apply a battery of atomic level control and structural characterization techniques to achieve a level of understanding of the microscopic structure that is not possible with amorphous oxides. <br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The research has the potential to transform the utility of semiconductor structures by engineering and tailoring the properties of crystalline oxide-semiconductor interfaces at the atomic layer level. A key component of the project involves undergraduate and post-baccalaureate STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) participation in the implementation and practice of these techniques. Undergraduates grow materials using oxide MBE in both classroom and research environments and characterize these materials using synchrotron scattering techniques. The STEM graduates are involved in the engineering development and improvement of the synthesis and characterization techniques. This project is aimed at enhancing the technical skills of STEM graduates whose career goals are to transition to permanent technical positions in industry.

Korelsky	05/31/2011	$15,000.00		bob.frank@yale.edu	Office of Sponsored Projects	New Haven	CT	065208327	2037854689	CSE	7495	7495	$0.00	The past two decades have witnessed the exploration of a range of grammatical formalisms by computational, theoretical, and psycho linguists, for their utility in building natural language interfaces and machine translation systems, characterizing the nature of human linguistic knowledge, and constructing models of language processing.  Because many of these formalisms share important formal and linguistic properties (most prominently, mild context-sensitivity and lexicalization), there are many potential synergies, computational, theoretical and psychological, that can be gotten by considering ideas that stem from work outside of particular formalism.   Moreover, though theoreticians, computationalists, and psychologists are concerned with solving different problems, ideas that derive from one community often turn out to have a significant consequences for the others.  <br/><br/>The goal of this NSF-sponsored workshop, which will take place at Yale University on June 10-12, 2010, is to foster both of these types of connections: across the formalism divide and the theoretical-computational-psycho divide.   The Tree-Adjoining Grammar community has a history of exploring these connections, and this workshop aims to expand the community of researchers involved in such cross-pollination even further.  The workshop will bring together researchers from the Tree-Adjoining Grammar, Minimalism, Categorial Grammar, Dependency Grammar, HPSG,  and LFG  communities to look at the similarities and differences of the formalisms, with the goals of developing shared, broad-coverage grammars, transferring parsing and machine learning algorithms from one formalism to another. and gaining new insights into the properties of different formalisms and their capacity for linguistic and psycholinguistic explanation. <br/><br/>This award provides support crucial to attract to the workshop not only prominent researchers, who will give invited presentations and tutorial lectures, but also, and perhaps even more importantly, PhD students.  By introducing junior researchers to the fruitfulness of cross-framework and cross-disciplinary interactions at an early stage in their careers, our hope is that the award will have a transformative effect on the kind of work they will engage in during their entire careers, potentially leading to a broader, more integrated perspective in the field at large.

However Silicon anodes have limited applications because of the huge volume change associated with the insertion and extraction of Lithium. This causes cracking and pulverization of the anode, which leads to a loss of electrical contact and eventual fading of capacity. The objective of this project is to develop novel stress-resistant nanostructured Silicon anode architectures with a high capacity and long life. We will systematically study various anode architectures with a view to understanding and controlling failure in nanostructured Lithium-ion battery anodes. More specifically, we propose to study three categories of nanostructured anodes: (1) Nano-rod/nano-spring arrays of Silicon and other promising materials such as Aluminum and Tin, (2) nano-compliant support structures for conventional Silicon film anodes and (3) Silicon scoops deposited on nanorods composed of an electrochemically inert material. In addition to the experiments, atomic scale simulations are proposed to investigate the physics of Lithium diffusion and stress build-up in nanostructures. This information will be used to develop continuum models in order to determine the optimal structure of the nanopatterned electrode.<br/><br/>Rechargeable Lithium-ion batteries are integral to today's information-rich, mobile society. The proposed work will provide the fundamental understanding necessary to develop and refine the design of nanostructured anodes to enable order of magnitude enhancements in charge capacity, charge/discharge rate capability and cycle life of Lithium-ion batteries. This can lead to revolutionary new high performance battery technologies which in addition to portable electronics could also play a central role in next generation wireless communication devices, stationary storage batteries, microchips, defense applications, and even in hybrid and all electric vehicles.

Anderson	05/31/2015	$209,824.00		jeffrey.park@yale.edu	Office of Sponsored Projects	New Haven	CT	065208327	2037854689	GEO	017F	0000	$0.00	Shear in the mantle associated with the motion of Earth's tectonic plates tends to align minerals within large volumes of mantle rock.  One of the most common minerals in mantle rock is olivine, which is stiffer in some direction than in others.  The directional variation of stiffness is called anisotropy.  The partial alignment of olivine minerals in mantle rocks causes these rocks to be anisotropic.  Anisotropy expresses itself in the tendency for seismic wavespeed to vary slightly on the direction of propagation, shear-waves to acquire elliptical polarization, and for incoming seismic waves to scatter into other seismic waves. Love wave are horizontally-polarized surface waves that scatter to elliptically-polarized Rayleigh waves when they encounter regional concentrations of anisotropy.   These scattered waves, called Quasi-Love, or QL waves, are useful for detecting shear near plate boundaries, where the strong plates stretch the plastically-deformable mantle surrounding the plates as they sink at oceanic trenches, spread at rift zones, or crumple where continents collide.  QL waves can be observed on individual seismograms, and complement other types of seismic data. The investigators found QL scattering in and around the Cascadia subduction zone at the NW border in seismic data from the land-based USArray, a component of Earthscope.  At the Cascadia plate boundary the Juan de Fuca plate converges with the North American plate along the coast of the Pacific Northwest, and sinks into the mantle beneath the line of Cascade volcanoes.  Offshore anisotropy beneath the Juan de Fuca plate appears to align in agreement with coastal anisotropy estimated from other data.  This suggests that the mantle beneath the Juan de Fuca plate deforms from the lateral motion of the plate, rather than from slab rollback, that is, a progressive retreat of the plate as it falls (of its own weight) into the plastically-deforming mantle.<br/><br/>The researchers are extending their analysis to the entire Cascadia subduction zone, stacking Quasi-Love scattered waves for stations along great-circle paths that track the progress of individual surface waves. The frequency dependence of the maximum scattering is sensitive to the depth range of anisotropy. QL-scattering proximal to the Cascadia subduction zone is significant, but lateral anisotropic gradients are present inland as well. The researchers are extending the stacking procedure inland from Cascadia to explore QL-crossing paths along the San Andreas system, the Basin and Range, and the Yellowstone hot spot.  <br/><br/>For detailed interpretation of the data the researchers compute synthetic seismograms in simplified earth-model geometries as a quick-interpretation tool, and explore 3-D structure in anisotropy by adapting the SPECFEM-GLOBE seismic-wave simulator to explore the effects of hypothetical anisotropic geometries.  The researchers will produce maps of the Western US, that highlight the locations where Love-to-Rayleigh scattering is strong, what symmetry orientation (and therefore shear orientation) appears to be consistent with the scattering, and whether the anisotropic gradients are asthenospheric (i.e. dynamic), lithospheric (perhaps fossil) or represent deeper flow in the upper mantle.

When a large force (stress) is applied to minerals or rocks under shallow Earth conditions, they will be deformed by brittle fracture. In the deep interior of Earth, temperature is higher and then plastic deformation becomes possible. This plastic deformation helps material circulation by convection that cools Earth and causes most of geological activities including mountain building and deep circulation of water and other materials.  However, to date very little is known on the plastic flow properties of materials under deep Earth conditions due mainly to the technical difficulties. For example, in the deep interior of Earth, not only is temperature high, but also pressure is high. Usually pressure suppresses atomic motion and hence plastic deformation becomes difficult under high-pressure conditions. Does the role of pressure become more important than temperature and hence the viscosity of materials increases with depth? Also most of minerals undergo a series of phase transformations. How do these phase transformations affect the plastic properties? These issues are critical to our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of Earth and other terrestrial planets. <br/><br/>Despite its importance, almost nothing was known about these deep earth deformation as recently as ~ten years ago. Recognizing this need, the investigators started a group effort to develop new techniques of plastic deformation under deep Earth conditions in 2002. Based on the studies during the previous funding periods, they have made major progress including the development of new types of deformation apparatus and the improvements to the stress (and strain) measurements using synchrotron x-ray sources. As a result, we can now conduct quantitative deformation experiments to ~20 GPa and ~2000 K. However, these conditions correspond only to the depth of ~500 km. Earth's mantle extends to ~2900 km. Also, there has been very poor control of water content in materials previously studied. In this new phase of technical development, the team of investigators will focus on (i) extending the maximum pressure to ~30 GPa and higher (~1000 km depth), (ii) improving the control of chemical environment (such as water fugacity) under high-pressure conditions, and (iii) improving the stress measurements through the use of new hardware and theory. These developments will allow  investigation of the plastic properties of Earth materials to the conditions equivalent to the shallow part of the lower mantle under well-controlled chemical environment. Applications of these techniques will shed important new light into our understanding of dynamics of whole Earth.  The project is a collaboration among teams at four institutions, and will provide enhanced infrastructure to the experimental geophysics community, including new facilities at national synchrotron beamlines that will be available to the broader community. The developments will include training and mentoring of graduate students and post doctoral scholars.

Recipients of such messages may not question their validity. Moreover, even upon careful investigation and reflection, not everyone will agree about the validity of particular claims. This project will develop tools that help people make personal assessments of credibility. Rather than relying on particular sources as authoritative arbiters of ground truth, the goal is to minimize the amount of social implausibility. That is, the tool will identify assertions that are disbelieved by similar people (those who, after careful consideration, someone tended to agree with in the past) or come from sources that someone has tended to disagree with. A text mining system for online media will be developed to extract controversial assertions and the beliefs expressed by users about those assertions. Comparisons of beliefs about common assertions, and retractions or updates to beliefs, will be tracked as part of personalized reputation measures.<br/><br/>This work is the first attempt to formally address the automatic assessment of information credibility based on text mining and social computational systems. The techniques will provide the solution to many challenging research problems in information retrieval and reputation networks. The techniques are broadly applicable to other domains where the credibility of content and reputation of sources is a concern, to help a broad class of information consumers.  Prototype tools will be released freely and demonstrated in high schools, thereby building awareness of the diversity of beliefs around topics of public interest.

This project seeks to evaluate novel theoretical constructs in the context of comparatively simple terrain forcing.  The main hypothesis to be explored is that orographic precipitation in the tropics may be described as ascent-forced convection, in which terrain plays a key role in modulating not only upstream triggering of new convective clouds, but their entire life cycle along trajectories across a given mountain barrier.  While cordilleras at various latitudes will ultimately be examined, intensive observations will first be conducted by the NSF-supported University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft operating over/around the Caribbean Island of Dominica.  During the DOMinica EXperiment (DOMEX) in March-April 2011, the King Air's in situ and cloud radar/lidar King Air measurement capabilities will be combined with data from ground-based weather radar and networked rain gauges to comprehensively describe clouds and precipitation that form when comparatively steady trade-wind flow impacts an isolated mountain ridge.  These measurements will specify the nature of this convection, including its relationship to the existence and magnitude of upstream moisture and temperature fluctuations, and better describe cloud dynamics and microphysics in terms of entrainment, vertical velocity, and cloud water production.  A second focus will be to determine the applicability of these results to other locations and climate zones, with candidate comparison sites including Patagonia, Costa Rica, and southeastern Alaska.  Adjunct studies will evaluate stable isotope analysis of runoff water as a straightforward means of determining the average Drying Ratio--the ratio of precipitation to the total water vapor flux across a mountain ridge, known to vary from near 0% in certain tropical locations to 50% at higher latitudes.<br/><br/>The Intellectual Merit of this work centers on development of improved means to explore and describe a newly hypothesized ascent-forced atmospheric convection, and to better relate its occurrence to differing climate zones and associated airmass modifications for flow trajectories across both isolated and more complex arrangements of mountain ridges.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts of this research will include mentoring and field-site training of a postdoc and graduate/undergrad students pursuing work spanning several scientific disciplines, as well as extensive international cooperation.  Ultimate impacts could include improved weather and climate modeling, isotope-climate interpretation, and water resources management.

This summer school, part of an annual program organized and sponsored by the Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium (RMMC), focuses on recent developments in the understanding of conservation laws.  The program begins with a tutorial on the subject, followed by lectures to introduce the participants to current research.  The program is designed to balance the mathematical, computational, and modeling aspects of conservation laws, and it aims to expose participants, especially graduate students, to current areas of active research in the field.<br/><br/>Conservation Laws (or balance laws) are systems of partial differential equations that arise naturally as models for a variety of physical phenomena, including fluid dynamics, magneto-hydrodynamics, combustion, oil recovery, and nonlinear elasticity.  The focus of this summer program is on recent developments in the understanding of such equations.  Beginning with a rapid tutorial phase, the program will expose participants to current areas of active research and help prepare them to pursue open problems in the field.  The program will touch on both theoretical and computational aspects of conservation laws, and application areas (old and new) in which conservation laws play a central role will be highlighted.  Participation of members of groups underrepresented in mathematics is encouraged and supported.<br/><br/>Summer school web site: http://math.uwyo.edu/rmmc/2010/

Welch (Kansas State University)<br/><br/>Key Collaborators: Doina Carragea and Gerard Kluitenberg (Kansas State University), and Paula X. Kover [University of Manchester (United Kingdom)<br/><br/>The research will examine plant responses to vegetation density, which are commonly referred to as shade-avoidance and which greatly affect yield in crop species.  Two plant species, Brassica rapa and Arabidopsis thaliana, are used in this research as models for developing computational approaches that will enable both reconstruction of gene networks that regulate density responses and prediction of different traits (such as flowering time, height, and fruit set) from complex genotypes.  Data collection will include 1) quantifying the developmental, morphological, and transcriptional responses of experimental genetic material (such as mutants and segregating progeny) to realistic density treatments and controlled manipulations of light quality indicative of high- and low-density; and 2) recording near-plant environmental conditions in the field, including soil and atmospheric variables, and incident spectra at 15-min intervals.  Field studies will provide an agroecologically relevant picture of gene function.  In modeling, the project will integrate genetic and environmental data to generate a more complete gene network than is possible from mutant or laboratory studies alone.  Finally, because yield and other phenotypes serve as model outputs, the computational approaches will enable the prediction of diverse traits from plant genotypes.  <br/><br/>The project will 1) develop evolutionary genetics modules to educate teachers on evolutionary theory and basic molecular genetic approaches and 2) provide seed kits to be used in age-appropriate, inquiry-based exercises.  Approximately 75 teachers will be hosted annually in Wyoming, and this educational outreach should ultimately reach between 60-70% of all biology teachers in the state.  As a further outreach component, the computational technology to be used involves a network of computing volunteers.  Via the project website, this network provides another venue to distribute educational materials.  Finally, long-term, high-sampling-rate time series of incident irradiance spectra are extremely rare but of interest to communities ranging from plant scientists to solar energy researchers.  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory will web-deliver the wide-band spectral measurements made as part of this research.  DNA sequence and gene expression information will be deposited in the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) SRA and GEO databases.

University Avenue	Laramie	WY	820712000	3077665320	GEO	1525	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	This project will focus on in situ and remote sensing measurements of wintertime clouds over the Park Range of the Rocky Mountains in northern Colorado. These clouds are generally mixed-phase; the combination of ice, liquid and water vapor presents challenges both to measurements and modeling, and consequently, to understanding their impact on atmospheric radiation and on precipitation. The Colorado Airborne Multi-Phase Cloud Study (CAMPS) will use the Wyoming King Air research aircraft instrumented with both remote (cloud radar and cloud lidar) and in situ sensors (cloud and particle probes, total water hygrometer) to elucidate the vertical and horizontal structure of cold mixed-phase clouds.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/><br/>The data gathered during CAMPS will include information about macro- and microphysical parameters of mixed-phase clouds obtained by both in situ and remote-sensing methods. These data will be analyzed to address a number of important questions about the structure, properties and impacts of mixed-phase clouds. Specific goals include:<br/><br/>1. To assess the vertical and horizontal structure and spatial and temporal variation of cloud properties (particle size distribution, ice and liquid water content, particle habit) in liquid, mixed-phase and precipitating clouds at a mid-latitude continental site with complex terrain during winter.<br/><br/>2. To assess the impact of topography and associated variations in vertical forcing on cloud generation and cloud properties.<br/><br/>3. To develop a data set that provides the information necessary for improving the representation of mixed-phase clouds in cloud-resolving and climate models.<br/><br/>4. To provide correlative data for validation of the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program mobile facility and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration A-Train satellite-borne remote sensors.<br/><br/>5. To provide observational confirmation of the redistribution of snowfall associated with riming inhibition due to enhanced CCN. <br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/><br/>Ultimately, by enhancing the community's understanding of cloud-scale processes, the data from CAMPS will be the basis for improvements in the representation of clouds in global climate models. This will lead to more accurate calculations of current and future climate. In addition the CAMPS project will contribute to both formal and informal education at a number of levels. At least one graduate student from each of the participating universities will be involved with the field work and/or data analysis related to this project. The investigators will include undergraduates from their institutions in flight-planning and/or meteorology exercises related to CAMPS when possible. Formal educational opportunities for elementary school students will be coordinated by the Storm Peak Laboratory staff, including visits to the laboratory and aircraft and classroom exercises. Outreach activities will include signage at the Steamboat Springs Ski Resort, an interactive display at the gondola building and coordination with the 2011 Steamboat Weather Summit.

Previous research is limited in the magnitude of wavelength change because it employed passive optical resonators with short photon lifetimes. The proposed research will make use of active optical resonators (resonators with gain) that exhibit much longer photon lifetimes and thus a larger magnitude of wavelength change. Theoretical investigations will model aspects such as gain saturation and spontaneous emission, and will be complemented by experimental studies in active Indium Phosphide resonators. This semiconductor platform allows control of wavelength conversion via auxiliary optical pulses having sub-milliwatt powers and telecommunication wavelengths.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The proposed activity will provide a rich theoretical and experimental research experience for two Ph. D. students and will train them in an area of national importance; equal opportunity will be given to interested female and minority candidates in the tradition of the University of Rochester. Emphasis will be placed on communicating research findings to the global scientific community through peer-reviewed journal papers and major international conferences. Results will also be integrated directly into graduate and undergraduate courses on optoelectronics and lightwave technology at The Institute of Optics.<br/><br/>

A primary goal for NOAO is to maintain a suite of world leading capabilities that allow the community to do research at the highest level.  A key aspect to fulfilling this goal is fostering collaborations and research across all of modern astronomy facilities including space based and radio observatories. Modern astronomy has evolved to a panchromatic endeavor that utilizes data obtained from gamma rays to radio waves.  NOAO astronomers involved in research collaborations that take advantage of space telescopes (e.g. Hubble, Chandra, and Spitzer) and radio/sub-millimeter telescopes (e.g., VLA and ALMA) enhance the development of NOAO's ground based facilities through complementary observations across the electromagnetic spectrum.  Research collaborations with these other facilities ensure NOAO astronomers are engaged in the most relevant areas of study in modern astronomy, and so they maximize the contribution from NOAO's own ground based telescopes to this effort through significant ground based observing programs, technology development, and the training of the next generation of scientists and engineers.  This support via interagency transfers from other governmental agencies will provide research support to NOAO scientists.  This support will help NOAO carry out its core mission of developing the best ground based facilities for the entire US community.
0961827	Collaborative Research:  The Impact of Multiple Nursery Areas and Adult Age Structure on the Population Dynamics of Marine Fishes	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	06/15/2010	05/22/2012	John Wilkin	NJ	Rutgers University New Brunswick	Continuing grant	David L. Garrison	05/31/2013	$192,908.00		jwilkin@rutgers.edu	33 Knightsbridge Road	Piscataway	NJ	088543925	8489320150	GEO	1650	4444, 9169, EGCH	$0.00	Many marine populations exhibit complex life histories in which larval and juvenile stages are spatially separated from adults. This is the case for many coastal-spawning, estuarine-dependent fishes which utilize multiple estuaries as nursery grounds to ensure that recruitment failure in any single estuary does not translate to total recruitment failure at the population level. For these species, the location and timing of spawning is believed to regulate the pattern of supply of larvae to potential estuarine nursery areas. Furthermore, many of these species exhibit age-dependent coastal migrations which increase in amplitude with age. Thus, there is the potential that changes in the age structure in the population can affect the pattern of supply of larvae to nursery areas and structure the pattern of recruitment. The investigators will carry out an integrated empirical and simulation approach to study the sources, patterns and consequences of larval supply to estuarine nursery areas for Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) along the East Coast of the US. The first goal will be to quantify the contribution of these nursery areas to coast wide recruitment. Juvenile menhaden from nursery areas from Massachusetts to Georgia will be sampled and the microchemical constituents of their otoliths will be characterized. These chemical signatures will be used to assign the nursery affinities of adult menhaden in the coastwide population. The investigators will test the null hypothesis that the Chesapeake Bay remains the most important source of recruits to the population. By determining the nursery affinities of adults from different year classes in the population they will assess whether the contribution of nurseries varies or has shifted over time. The second goal is use a population model linked to an individual-based coupled physical-biological model of recruitment to evaluate whether the known age-dependent migrations of adult menhaden are sufficient to cause the observed shifts in the distribution of larval menhaden that seed potential nursery areas. The simulation model will assist in evaluating mechanisms behind observed changes in the distribution of juvenile menhaden.<br/><br/>This work will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the regulation of spatially-structured marine populations. The last decade has seen the range extension of several estuarine-dependent marine species with dispersive larvae and the long-term recruitment decline of others. This integrated research program seeks to explore the effects of population demography, oceanographic circulation, and nursery site diversity on subsequent population dynamics. Given the documented changes in habitat quality in many estuarine nursery areas, and the anticipated impacts of climate change on oceanographic circulation, distributional changes in individual species are likely to become more common. Moreover, given the pivotal role that many estuarine-dependent species play in many marine ecosystems, understanding distributional changes will have direct consequences for the structure and function of the ecosystems to which they belong. The project will also train young scientists in areas of research (quantitative fisheries ecology, physical oceanography) for which there is current a national need.

Principal among the associated problems are the computation of the eigenstructure of regular matrix polynomials, and in the case of  singular polynomials, the computation of minimal indices and minimal bases. In recent work, the investigators and their colleagues identified rich spaces of linearizations which led to the construction of new structured linearizations,condensed forms, and accurate structure-preserving algorithms. By using new techniques, they have also made progress on singular polynomials, showing that linearizations provide a pathway to the reliable computation of minimal indices and bases. This proposal singles out several important tasks for investigation concerning linearizations, quadratifications and minimal indices and bases. The goal is to develop new algorithms for these computations, and increase theoretical understanding so as to aid in the formulation of effective algorithms.<br/><br/>The problems studied in this proposal are ubiquitous in a wide range of important problems in engineering and applied sciences. Numerical methods for their solution are critical in structural mechanics, molecular dynamics, vibrational analysis, the simulation of electrical circuits, elastic deformation of anisotropic materials, and optical waveguide design, to give a few examples. <br/>The trend towards extreme designs, such as high speed trains, optoelectronic devices, micro-electromechanical systems, and ``superjumbo'' jets such as the Airbus 380, presents a challenge for the computation of the resonant frequencies of these structures. These extreme designs often lead to computationally sensitive problems, while the physics of the underlying problem leads to structure that numerical methods should exploit in order to obtain physically meaningful results. The aim of this project is to increase our theoretical understanding of mathematical transformations that preserve these structures and thereby advance the development of computationally effective algorithms. Consequently, this work will have direct benefit to scientists and engineers across a wide range of disciplines.

Does the migration experience serve as a pathway to hometown influence and political power?  What factors explain the formation of migrant-based organizations (MBOs) in the United States?  This dissertation explores these three questions by using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods to gather and analyze data from migrant-sending communities in four Mexican states and migrant-receiving communities in four US states. Remittances from migration are a vital source of income for many communities, but the political impacts of these resource flows are not fully understood. This dissertation refocuses the questions of migrant impact back on the municipalities of origin in four Mexican states, Oaxaca, Guanajuato, Zacatecas and Chiapas and in the US locales where their migrants are concentrated.<br/><br/>Prior to the NSF-funded research, the investigator has conducted field work to gather qualitative data and oversee a survey of municipal authorities in four Mexican states.  Funds from the NSF will support five field research trips within the United States and two trips to the Mexico research sites.  Data gathered from interviews with migrant leaders in the US will make possible a much more complete understanding of the transnational reality of the Mexican communities in the study--an understanding that would remain incomplete without taking into account the US dimension.<br/><br/>Extant research has shed much light on the economic, social and cultural impacts of migration on sending-communities, but much less is understood about changes in the power structure of sending communities or the political biographies of those who hold local power.  The bulk of research that has explicitly focused on the impacts of MBOs on hometown politics has consisted of thick descriptions of a limited number of cases.  This dissertation aims to move beyond these descriptive analyses to select systematically cases that vary on the dependent variables and test a series of causal hypotheses about the research questions.  To achieve these goals, it will be necessary to draw the connections between the migrant-sending communities in Mexico and their members in US receiving-communities.  Finally, this dissertation will contribute a new quantitative analysis of a database of hometown associations (HTAs) in the US, maintained by the Mexican government, to establish the correlates of HTA formation.  To date no such analysis has been published.<br/><br/>Beyond its expected scholarly contribution, this dissertation will provide insights for policymaking in the US and Mexico.  Immigration is among our most important bilateral issues with Mexico, but very little policy-relevant research has focused on migrant-sending communities there.  Systematic and data-driven research that attempts to study simultaneously Mexican communities and their migrant members in the US is even less common.  The failure of major US policy efforts to curb the flow of undocumented immigration into the United States, most prominently through NAFTA and the border enforcement build-ups that began in the mid-1990s such as Operation Gatekeeper, may in part be attributable to an insufficient understanding among policymakers of the complex social, economic and political dynamics of transnational migration.  The findings from this research will be shared with scholars and practitioners during sessions in a planned summer seminar on immigration and border security, sponsored by the new American University Center on Latino and Latin American Studies.

Przytycki, Mikhail G. Khovanov<br/><br/>This proposal asks for financial support for US based<br/> participants, for a 3-week long summer program devoted to Knot<br/> Theory: Knots in Poland III: conference on Knot Theory and its<br/> Ramifications.  It will be a conference interspersed with<br/> specialized workshops and tutorials.  It will be third<br/> conference in the series of large, very successful international<br/> conferences ``Knots in Poland.  The conferences will take place<br/> in Warsaw July 18-25 and in Banach Center in Bedlewo July<br/> 25-August 4, 2010. Specifically, we propose to support about 15<br/> graduate students and 10 mathematicians without grant.  As part<br/> of the conference we will have a series of 3 talks by Tom Mrowka<br/> on his proof that Khovanov homology can be understood as a page<br/> in a spectral sequence converging to a version of Instanton<br/> Floer homology.  A consequence of this is that Khovanov homology<br/> detects the unknot.  Knots have fascinated people from the dawn<br/> of the human history.  Much of the early knot theory was<br/> motivated by physics and chemistry (e.g. Kelvin theory of vortex<br/> atoms). The fundamental problem in knot theory is to be able to<br/> distinguish non-equivalent knots. There have been exciting new<br/> developments in the area of Knot Theory in recent years. From<br/> the Jones, Homflypt, and Kauffman polynomials, through quantum<br/> invariants of 3-manifolds, Topological Quantum Field Theories,<br/> to relations with gauge theory type invariants in 4-dimensional<br/> topology (Donaldson, Witten, etc).  More recently, Khovanov<br/> introduced homology theory of links which categorifies the Jones<br/> polynomial (a chain complex is build on the Kauffman model of<br/> the Jones polynomial).  Soon after, Ozsvath and Szabo developed<br/> Heegaard-Floer homology, that lifts the Alexander polynomial.<br/> These two significantly different theories are closely related<br/> and the dependencies are the object of intensive study. One can<br/> mention here Khovanov-Rozansky categorification of Homflypt<br/> polynomial, categorification of the Kauffman bracket skein<br/> module of some 3-dimensional manifolds, and the result of<br/> T.Mrowka that Khovanov homology detects the unknot.<br/><br/>The subject has significant applications and relations with<br/>biology, physics, chemistry and the theory of computation.  We<br/>feel that a conference on this subject is highly appropriate at<br/>this time, and we strive to be in the frontier of new development<br/>in knot theory and its ramifications.  The project has broader<br/>impact in several aspects.  Knots in Poland conference brings<br/>together from all over the word, third-world countries, former<br/>Soviet Union, minorities, women, and provides an opportunity for<br/>researchers and students to share their latest ideas and to<br/>collaborate with each other. The knowledge obtained on this<br/>occasion will be disseminated by participants throughout the<br/>world.  Distinguished researchers (including about 10 woman) will<br/>deliver plenary talks surveying the state of knowledge related to<br/>Knot Theory and its Ramifications.  PhD students and fresh PhD's<br/>will be encouraged to attend.

Considerable progress has been made in defining N cycling processes in marine environments in recent years, but significant questions remain unanswered in part due to methodological limitations. Traditional tools for studying N cycling, for example, cannot accurately assess phytoplankton or bacteria specific N use in marine ecosystems. Therefore there is a need to develop new techniques and methodologies. The PIs of this project have recently made two important advances in this context: (1) a flowcytometric methodology (FCM) to separate phytoplankton from bacteria was applied to separately measure N uptake by these two groups. Prior methodologies relied on measurements of different size fractions, which always contain some degree of both phytoplankton and bacterial uptake. FCM allows for the distinct separation of bacterial versus phytoplankton N incorporation. (2) N-based DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) methodology has been adapted to interrogate N uptake in specific phytoplankton populations. DNA SIP can provide evidence for the uptake of an N source into a specific population of phytoplankton or bacteria. This methodology is in contrast to traditional measurements, which cannot make inferences about individual populations or species. <br/><br/>This project aims to apply these two methodological advances in order to obtain the next generation of N uptake measurements. Phytoplankton and bacteria specific uptake rates will be measured via the FCM technique, and the individual groups or species of phytoplankton or bacteria will be interrogated for N uptake via DNA SIP. These tools will be applied across the well-characterized nutrient gradient found in Chesapeake Bay during one summer cruise and one winter cruise. Phytoplankton, bacterial, and archaeal populations will be characterized along the sampling transect via multiplexed pyrosequencing technology. N uptake will be measured for inorganic (NH4+, NO3-, and NO2-) and organic N sources (15N and 14C urea dual-labeled and amino acids) as substrates. The investigators hypothesize that phytoplankton will derive a larger percentage of their N nutrition from organic forms along the transect (i.e. North to South), as competition with bacteria for ammonium increases. DNA SIP will be applied to specific dominant phytoplankton and bacterial populations in order to investigate their N nutrition. By applying this unique combination of methodologies, the project will provide unprecedented community, group and species level resolution of N uptake in Chesapeake Bay and will furnish us with an improved understanding of N cycling in the Bay and marine systems as a whole.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will be integrated into the education of students at the high-school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. Several graduate students will be directly involved in conducting the proposed research, and the PIs will provide undergraduate directed research opportunities for talented and motivated students seeking research experience. Students will be trained in several research areas including: molecular biology, microbial ecology, ecosystems biology, as well as environmental and analytical chemistry. Additionally, the PIs will extend K-12 educational outreach to the community through engaging six Oklahoma high school teachers in summer research projects, followed by interactive videoconferencing via a mobile platform to provide virtual interactive field trips to K-12 teachers in Oklahoma schools. This will be achieved through collaboration with the K-20 Center for Education and Community Renewal at the University of Oklahoma. K-20 is an interdisciplinary, statewide center focusing on educational and community renewal in Oklahoma through interactive, action-oriented partnerships among schools, universities, industry, community and governmental agencies. The Center has an extensive network of over 500 schools and industry partners throughout the state.

McCartney	05/31/2014	$531,174.00		walter.jetz@yale.edu	Office of Sponsored Projects	New Haven	CT	065208327	2037854689	BIO	1165	1165, 9178, 9179, 9183, 9184, BIOT	$0.00	Yale University and the University of Colorado Boulder are awarded grants to develop an interactive, online species distribution workbench and knowledge-base, the Map of Life, as the fundamental mechanism for documentation, integration, and advance of human biodiversity distribution knowledge. Despite hundreds of years of active exploration, human knowledge of the distribution of biodiversity remains very limited. A fundamental factor in this shortcoming is that the majority of direct and indirect information about species' distributions has not been mobilized and integrated. While researchers can readily access fine-scale environmental data with global coverage, access to integrated species distribution information at validated precision remains elusive. This collaborative project will develop a conceptual and cyberinfrastructure framework for provisioning and improving reliable species geographic range information. Map of Life will combine on a single website expert range maps, survey data, and range maps adjusted for species habitat suitability initially for terrestrial vertebrate species, with extensions planned for other animal and plant groups.  It will therefore serve the needs of all those requiring estimates of species geographic ranges across taxonomic groups and regions, such as scientists, land-managers, governments, policy-makers and the general public.  Users can upload data, edit input or output and directly improve or comment on existing maps which will iteratively lead to more advanced species distribution knowledge. Users can also download any and all maps in different formats directly from the application or perform batch-download for multiple species.  Finally, simple richness and regional species list tools will extend the products to users with a geographic focus.<br/><br/>Given that species range maps are one of the most commonly used and familiar information products in biology, the potential broader impacts and benefits of Map of Life to society are remarkable. Unlike printed range maps, the dynamic nature of editable online range maps encourages the public to move from roles of passive consumers to prosumers; they can both produce and consume information and generate new knowledge.  The Map of Life project also presents a unique cross-disciplinary training opportunity in macroecology and biodiversity informatics. Dedicated lab exchanges between Yale and the University of Colorado, along with workshops and symposia at professional meetings will allow extensive cross-fertilization of ideas.  The PIs will also develop targeted map and web tutorials illustrating the notion of human understanding of a species' geographic range and will showcase those products at the Yale Peabody Museum and the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History.

The purpose of the proposal is to explore further several types of questions that underlie these applications, in particular the 'product-phenomena' in matrix spaces and the 'expanding properties' of algebraic functions on finite fields.<br/> <br/>The problems in the proposal are mainly continuing a line of research (in particular by the PI) that turned out to have rather unexpected applications besides their intrinsic interest from the combinatorial point of view. Indeed, purely combinatorial (and basically elementary) techniques brought progress on issues that had stalled for quite some time, such as on the expander properties of certain 'thin' SL2 Caley graphs, and the 'expanding properties' of algebraic functions on finite fields.
1009545	Collaborative Research: Analysis of incompressible high Reynolds number flows	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS, COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH	07/01/2010	06/25/2010	James Kelliher	CA	University of California-Riverside	Standard Grant	Henry A. Warchall	06/30/2014	$15,048.00		kelliher@math.ucr.edu	Research & Economic Development	RIVERSIDE	CA	925210217	9518275535	MPS	1266, 7298	5913, 5977	$0.00	The purpose of this project is to conduct international collaborative research, between two teams of scientists from the USA and Brazil, in the mathematical analysis and modeling of turbulent incompressible fluids. The topics to be investigated are: small viscosity regime of second grade fluids; uniqueness of weak solutions for certain linear perturbations of the two-dimensional Euler equations; the vanishing viscosity limit of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with helical symmetry; the search for hypotheses on the structure of invariant measures or stationary statistical solutions of the two and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with anomalous dissipation; the search for energy cascade for flows in domains with physical boundaries; two-dimensional cascades with large gap bimodal forcing. Turbulence is a common phenomenon in fluid motion, in which macroscopic quantities (velocity, pressure, temperatures, etc.)  no longer have a deterministic relation with global parameters of the flow. Direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows at large Reynolds numbers, that occur in practical applications, such as in geophysical modeling and mixing in industrial processes, are out of reach even for the state-of-the-art computer power. Therefore, there is an urgent need to pursue this challenging problem analytically, by developing rigorous mathematical and statistical tools to investigate it, and to test these tools computationally. <br/><br/>While turbulence is an everyday occurrence, our understanding is still lacking in many aspects. Quantifying the effect of small scales on the dynamics of large scales is fundamental in modern multiscale science. The goal of the project is to enable a predictive analytical study of turbulent flows. This study will impact wide-ranging applications, from geophysical modeling, such as dispersion of pollutants in the ocean, to biological and industrial modeling, such as design of polymeric materials. The project will consolidate the well-established collaborative efforts of the principal investigators with their Brazilian counterparts, and may lead to new collaboration, especially among the junior research personnel. International collaboration among scientists is a key to economic competitiveness in global markets. Four US and three Brazilian academic institutions are involved in the project. The international dimension of the project is further emphasized through two planned workshops. Training and supervision of at least six Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows is also achieved through planned summer schools and scientific workshops. Students and postdoctoral fellows from the US will travel to Brazil to participate in the workshops and the summer schools and interact with the US and Brazilian researchers.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded with the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering.

This project will digitize and consolidate specimen records from 10 bee collections across the United States.  The investigators will make or verify species identifications, capture full label data, georeference and error-check localities, and upload this information to publicly accessible databases.  Web-based tools will be used to capture data across collections efficiently, validate bee and plant names through automated comparison with taxonomic authority files, and synthesize data on species pages with images, digitized literature records, and other information about bees and their host plants.  Data will be uploaded to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and to Discover Life (www.discoverlife.org), a website that features customizable global maps for all global bee species and dynamic identification keys for North American species.  To obtain information needed to conserve and manage pollinators, the investigators will work with ecologists to model geographic and temporal trends in bee populations in relation to environmental variables.  Bees are the most important pollinators of the approximately 1/3 of crops that require animal pollination.  Recent declines in honey bee populations highlight the need to understand better the roles of native bees in agricultural and natural systems.  This project will help predict risks to bees and their pollination services from climate change, habitat loss, and other factors.  The outreach program Bee Hunt (www.discoverlife.org/bee) will educate the public, including students in underserved communities, about bee diversity and the importance of pollination services.  Using digital photography and rigorous research protocols, Bee Hunt will empower people at biological field stations, nature centers, parks, schools, and other sites to collect high-quality data to augment information from specimen records.
0951998	Collaborative Research: Examining the Evolution of Biospheric Oxygenation in Late Archean to Middle Proterozoic Oceans Through High-Resolution Trace Metal Chemostratigraphy	EAR	GLOBAL CHANGE, GEOBIOLOGY & LOW TEMP GEOCHEM	07/01/2010	06/04/2012	Timothy Lyons	CA	University of California-Riverside	Continuing grant	Enriqueta Barrera	06/30/2013	$105,600.00		timothy.lyons@ucr.edu	Research & Economic Development	RIVERSIDE	CA	925210217	9518275535	GEO	1577, 7295	OTHR	$0.00	Intellectual merit: The PIs propose to obtain high-resolution trace metal geochemical profiles from organic-rich sedimentary rocks to examine the evolution of climate and biospheric oxygenation in the Late Archean to Middle Proterozoic. The connections between climate and oxygenation are manifold. Oxygen levels in the deep sea are affected by the rate at which organic carbon is exported from productive surface waters, and hence ultimately from atmospheric CO2. In turn, enhanced burial of organic carbon in marine sediments can increase the O2 content of the atmosphere, with climatic consequences on an Archean Earth dependent on CH4 as a greenhouse gas. Oxygen levels also affect the ocean concentrations of trace nutrients such as Fe and Mo, potentially altering the vigor of marine surface biota and the efficiency of surface-to-deep carbon pumping. Earlier work by the PIs discovered traces of oxygenic photosynthesis and surface ocean oxygenation at least 50-100 M.y. before the first major rise of atmospheric O2 (2.45-2.32 Ga Great Oxidation Event; GOE). Their chemostratigraphic approach revealed an otherwise unrecognized history of biospheric oxygenation that is more complex than previously realized.  Therefore, detailed investigation of this history allows them to test fundamental concepts that relate O2, carbon, micronutrients and climate. For example, can the same basic concepts developed to explain Holocene climate and carbon cycling explain conditions in the Archean and Proterozoic? The PIs propose to refine the timeline of biospheric oxygenation by developing an extensive compilation of trace metal concentrations for Late Archean to Middle Proterozoic rocks emphasizing key intervals straddling the GOE: the 2.7 Ga Joy Lake Sequence (Minnesota, U.S.A.), the 2.3 Ga Rooihoogte and Timeball Hill Formations (South Africa), and the 1.8-1.7 Ga Chuanlinggou Formation (North China). Trace metal geochemical profiles, when combined with sedimentary Fe geochemistry, can constrain the nature of local sedimentary conditions (e.g., bottom water redox state and basin restriction). Bottom water Mo concentrations in ancient oceans can be estimated by comparing Mo/TOC of these rock samples with sediment Mo/TOC and seawater concentrations in modern anoxic basins. For other trace metals whose marine geochemistry is less well understood, broad differences in metal marine budgets between time intervals can be made by comparison with Mo. The Mo isotope paleoredox proxy will be used to procure independent constraints on the extent of regional/global water column euxinia and assess the impact on trace metal abundances in seawater. Re-Os geochronology may provide precise depositional ages. <br/><br/>The PIs will address four main questions: <br/>1. How long is the time lag between the development of pervasive surface ocean oxygenation (and by inference oxygenic photosynthesis) and the GOE? <br/>2. What is the response of early Paleoproterozoic metal marine budgets to the GOE? <br/>3. Do metal marine budgets show temporal trends in the Middle Proterozoic related to increasing biospheric O2 and/or expansion of ocean euxinia?<br/>4. What implications do such trends have for climate during the early Earth and how was microbial and eukaryotic ecology and evolution affected?<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impact: This proposal promotes the early career development of Co-PI Kendall. Additionally, as a component of their project activities, the PIs plan to establish a pilot project that will provide laboratory research experience for ASU undergraduates with physical disabilities (i.e., vision, hearing, speech, or motor impairments). The ultimate goal of the pilot is to increase access to science laboratories for postsecondary students with disabilities. It will also leverage the experiences of Kendall as a successful young laboratory scientist with severe hearing and mild speech impairments. Specific programs will be crafted for each student in collaboration with the ASU Disability Resource Center (DRC). The DRC will provide classroom aids and assistive technologies to facilitate direct student participation in laboratory research activities, including sample preparation, analysis, data reduction, and preparation of undergraduate theses.

This coupling is not fully understood, in<br/>part because the basic mechanical response of interacting<br/>graphene sheets is not yet adequately described.  Important for<br/>predicting this response are the nonlocal van der Waals forces<br/>between layers of graphene and between graphene and a supporting<br/>substrate.  The aim of the project is to develop and investigate<br/>continuum models of graphene structures that incorporate van der<br/>Waals forces in a rigorous way, accounting for long-range<br/>ordering of atoms.  Derived via a multiscale analysis, the<br/>continuum models are formulated within nonlinear rod and shell<br/>theories.  Equilibrium configurations of various graphene<br/>structures -- involving multiple layers and different substrates<br/>-- under external loads are analyzed using the tools of<br/>bifurcation theory.  Also, the thermal properties of nanotube<br/>composites are investigated within the framework of a network<br/>model taking into account the influence of van der Waals forces. <br/><br/>     Interest in macromolecules composed of carbon atoms has<br/>stimulated a great deal of recent research in materials science<br/>and physics.  Much of this work has focused on carbon nanotubes<br/>and, more recently, on the basic structural element of a nanotube<br/>-- graphene.  Graphene is a single-atom-thick sheet of bonded<br/>carbon atoms.  Despite many decades of effort, only within the<br/>last six years have scientists discovered methods for producing<br/>isolated individual graphene sheets.  This discovery has<br/>stimulated a flurry of experimental and theoretical work on the<br/>exceptional mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties of<br/>graphene.  Exploiting these properties could lead to significant<br/>advances in many technologies and yield, for example, more<br/>efficient solar cells, faster microprocessors, or lighter,<br/>stronger composite materials.  The principal goal of this project<br/>is to employ mathematical modeling to gain a better fundamental<br/>understanding of how atomic-scale forces between layers of a<br/>carbon nanostructure influence its mechanical and thermal<br/>characteristics.  The project investigators are developing and<br/>analyzing comprehensive multiscale models of interacting graphene<br/>layers by utilizing ideas at the forefront of existing theories<br/>as well as by introducing new mathematical tools.

Theme 1 of the project defines a new non-orthogonal<br/>fusion frame.  Preliminary studies show that the matrix<br/>representation of the new fusion frame operator can be diagonal<br/>over the same example where the existing fusion frame operator is<br/>completely sparse-less.  Because the fusion operation ultimately<br/>involves the inverse of the fusion frame operator, and because<br/>subspace transformations are generally unavailable in practical<br/>data fusion applications, such a new fusion frame with sparse or<br/>diagonal fusion operator becomes crucial.  Theme 2 studies a<br/>notion of multi-fusion frames based on multiple non-orthogonal<br/>projections onto one subspace.  Nearly surprisingly, the new<br/>multi-fusion frame operator defined on one proper subspace can be<br/>easily positive and invertible.  A number of theoretical issues<br/>are to be understood.  Rooted in studies of themes 1 and 2, theme<br/>3 outlines a notion of reflective sensing and multiple reflective<br/>sensing.  Their theory and applications in side-measured<br/>tomography and multi-path wireless signal receiving are examined. <br/>It is relevant to point out that the implementation of<br/>non-orthogonal projection operators is naturally achievable,<br/>based on earlier work by the investigator on pseudoframes for<br/>subspaces. <br/><br/>     The project relates to signal processing applications. <br/>Signal processing generally refers to making the signal easy to<br/>handle or of better quality.  It is everywhere seen in our modern<br/>society.  In this project, the principal novelties introduced to<br/>signal processing are the new notion of non-orthogonal fusion<br/>frames and ideas of performing data fusion from, e.g., wireless<br/>signals received from multiple paths.  Fusion frame is a notion<br/>developed specifically for various data fusion applications. <br/>Data fusion means combining data measured by different devices or<br/>by different means in order to obtain refined data.  The<br/>advantage of non-orthogonal fusion frames lies in the fact that<br/>they greatly improve efficiency of the data fusion procedure in<br/>practical sensor networks, particularly when the amount of data<br/>is large.  The project aims to develop effective methods of<br/>combining data detected in an array of sensors where information<br/>overlay (among sensors) is abundant and unpredictable.  With<br/>extremely complicated information overlaps, exact and efficient<br/>data combination is made possible by non-orthogonal fusion<br/>frames.  In particular, the project explores image fusion to<br/>provide a combined image of much greater precision or resolution<br/>without ad-hoc procedures present in conventional techniques. <br/>Data fusion problems arise in many applications, ranging from<br/>commercial imaging to geographic survey, mapping, wireless<br/>communication, multi-sensor/camera surveillance systems, and a<br/>great number of sensor network applications.

The common thread relating these approaches is a conception of the mind called embodiment.  At its core, embodiment emphasizes the importance of studying the mind or brain from the perspective that it is situated in a body, and exists to serve that body as it interacts with the world.  This workshop on embodiment includes a two-day gathering of 25-30 people intended to help coordinate thinking and catalyze research in this burgeoning area in the study of mind.  Towards that end, the workshop has three main objectives: 1) to lay out a course for progress; 2) to provide necessary crosstalk and common ground between disciplines and researchers; and 3) to create an enduring educational forum for the growth of embodiment research.  This workshop will bring together emerging and established faculty and students, from multiple disciplines, to build collaborative relationships, establish lines of communication, and discuss what role embodiment theories of mind can play in their own and each other?s research.  To address the needs to provide crosstalk between disciplines, to organize the work on embodiment, and to educate future students of embodiment, a primary product of this workshop will be an ongoing interdisciplinary website (www.embodiedmind.org) dedicated to review and communication of ideas and research on embodiment.

Current low-cost production methods for calcined clay and agricultural residue ash result in poor quality materials with low reactivity, limiting their use in construction.  This research aims to develop thermochemical treatments to align the optimum burning conditions of clay and agricultural residue to produce a more reactive supplementary cementitious material.  The specific research goals are as follows: 1) Quantify the change in optimum burning conditions and increased reactivity of calcined clays when flux additives are used, 2) Apply biomass pretreatments commonly used in biofuel production to agricultural residues to improve the quality of the ash for use in concrete, 3) Develop a methodology for combined calcined clay and agricultural residue ash production and use, and 4) Quantify the life cycle environmental benefit of the combined supplementary cementitious materials.<br/><br/>The replacement of high volumes of portland cement with the proposed combined calcined clay/agricultural residue ash material could greatly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with concrete construction and improve the quality of construction in developing countries since the proposed materials are low cost and widely available.  This multi-institution collaboration will provide interdisciplinary training in agricultural engineering, civil engineering, materials science, and life-cycle analysis and improved classroom instruction on infrastructure materials and sustainability.  A summer graduate student exchange will allow for improved collaboration and exposure to new equipment, research strategies, and laboratory methods.  An outreach program will also be developed to increase the participation of female and historically underrepresented students in engineering and sustainable development.

Wessler (University of Georgia - Athens) <br/><br/>The origin and early diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms) had profound impacts on Earth's biota, providing the raw genetic material from which most crops and economically important plants were derived. The diversification of genes, genomes, and important traits cannot be adequately interpreted without a comparative framework firmly rooted with genome sequences from basal angiosperms. A genome sequence of Amborella trichopoda will provide a foundation for all comparative analyses of angiosperm gene content and genome structure. Among basal angiosperms, Amborella has the most extensive genomic resources, already possessing high-quality genomic libraries, a physical map, and a large expressed gene (transcriptome) database. These resources, along with its pivotal phylogenetic position and moderate genome size (870 million base pairs), make Amborella the singular choice for the first basal angiosperm to be fully sequenced. The Amborella genome project will:  1) complete the physical map of Amborella; 2) generate a high-quality draft sequence and assembly of the Amborella genome using next generation sequencing methods and a cost-effective strategy that has been tested on rice genomes and is superior to traditional sequencing methodologies; and 3) develop bioinformatic tools and public access websites to display the project database as it is produced, and support comparative analyses and data mining by the scientific community at large.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Amborella genome, and the strategies being used to obtain and analyze the genome, will provide a unique scientific resource broadly impacting plant biology as well as excellent opportunities to demonstrate the utility of comparative genomics across the biological sciences. A reference for angiosperm genome content and organization will benefit the analysis of all currently available angiosperm genome sequences and those that are obtained in the future.  Comparative genomics workshops for middle and high school teachers will be held and teaching modules for broad dissemination of project outcomes and the utility of comparative genomics will be created. In addition, the project will expand a successful cross-cultural scientific mentoring program involving minority undergraduate students at each of the participating universities, train postdoctoral scientists and graduate students, and create mentoring opportunities for inner-city high school students to help them consider careers in the plant sciences. Specific mentoring activities for the post-docs will enhance their professional development.  The project website (www.Amborella.org) will provide public access to all data, project results, and long-term repositories. All sequence data will be deposited to NCBI as they become available and image data will be deposited at Morphbank (http://www.morphbank.net/).

To accomplish this goal the PIs will develop a detailed geochronology and analyze Hf- and O-isotopes of detrital zircons in sandstones of the Devonian Taylor Group and the Permian-Triassic Victoria Group. These data will allow them to better determine provenance and basin fill, and to understand the nature of the now ice covered source regions in East and West Antarctica. The PIs will document possible unexposed/unknown crustal terrains in West Antarctica, investigate sub-glacial terrains of East Antarctica that were exposed to erosion during Devonian to Triassic time, and determine the evolving provenance and tectonic history of the Devonian to Triassic Gondwana basins in the central Transantarctic Mountains. Detrital zircon data will be interpreted in the context of fluvial dispersal/drainage patterns, sandstone petrology, and sequence stratigraphy. This interpretation will identify source terrains and evolving sediment provenances. Paleocurrent analysis and sequence stratigraphy will determine the timing and nature of changing tectonic conditions associated with development of the depositional basins and document the tectonic history of the Antarctic sector of Gondwana. Results from this study will answer questions about the Panthalassan margin of Gondwana, the Antarctic craton, and the Beacon depositional basin and their respective roles in global tectonics and the geologic and biotic history of Antarctica. The Beacon basin and adjacent uplands played an important role in the development and demise of Gondwanan glaciation through modification of polar climates, development of peat-forming mires, colonization of the landscape by plants, and were a migration route for Mesozoic vertebrates into Antarctica. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>This proposal includes support for two graduate students who will participate in the fieldwork, and also support for other students to participate in laboratory studies. Results of the research will be incorporated in classroom teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels and will help train the next generation of field geologists. Interactions with K-12 science classes will be achieved by video/computer conferencing and satellite phone connections from Antarctica. Another outreach effort is the developing cooperation between the Byrd Polar Research Center and the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus.

Some of these enhanced properties include ultra-high yield strength, high ductility, good electrical conductivity, and high strain rate sensitivity. Such characteristics make nanotwinned metals highly attractive materials for structural applications. The aim of this project is to provide quantitative insight into the stability and fracture mechanisms in nanotwinned metals by way of a focused experimental and computational modeling effort. These critical issues, if unaddressed, would limit the practical application of these nanostructured metals and alloys, largely due to concerns over the achievement and stability of optimal properties. To this end, the specific objectives of the project are to investigate the role of twin boundaries in the brittle versus ductile response of nanotwinned metals and to study twin boundary-mediated processes such as twin-twin interactions and crack/defect nucleation at twin boundaries, in order to predict the critical twin lamella thickness for optimal performance of nanotwinned metals.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The proposed research is expected to have an impact on several important areas of nanostructured metal science and technology by way of providing valuable insight into the deformation mechanisms governing their behavior. In particular, it will provide a quantitative understanding into the optimal structural performance of nanocrystalline and nanotwinned metals, with regards to critical issues such as strength, ductility, stability, and fracture mechanisms. The ultimate goal of this unified experimental, modeling and manufacturing effort is the development of processing routes for bulk synthesis of nanotwinned metals, which would realize their potential as next generation structural materials. The proposed research would also contribute to the enrichment of the community through education and outreach efforts. Graduate and undergraduate students working on the project, would develop a strong foundation in the multidisciplinary areas of nanomechanics and computational materials science. In addition, the scientific advances made through this project would be integrated into the coursework developed by the investigators at their institutions.

1003838	Doctoral Dissertation Research: The Localized Geographies of Kenyan Election Violence	BCS	GEOGRAPHY AND SPATIAL SCIENCES	06/15/2010	06/03/2010	John O'Loughlin	CO	University of Colorado at Boulder	Standard Grant	Thomas J.

Understood broadly, such rights include not only safety, but also freedom from encountering artificial obstructions to improving socio-economic status. Intercommunity trust is viewed as crucial for maintaining peaceful relationships between groups, and institutional trust is believed to foster engagement in civil society and the formal political sphere. Using Kenya as a case study, this project investigates 1) the spatial dimensions of political violence and 2) the aftermath of conflict on institutional and intercommunity trust. A recent turn in the field of conflict studies emphasizes local-level dynamics of group clashes that occur within broader episodes of violence, ranging from outright civil war to persistent skirmishes between groups contending for political representation or natural resources. Considering this paradigm shift toward fine resolution analysis, this research employs a mixed-methods disaggregated approach to understanding conflict and its impacts on Kenya's social fabric. First, spatial-statistical methods are used to identify patterns of conflict within Kenya surrounding the country's most recent election violence. Beyond anecdotal accounts of certain areas experiencing high rates of violence, the goal of these analyses is to identify any unexpected trends. Furthermore, the project will assess what party interactions and faction activities may have contributed to these uneven patterns within the country. To illustrate the impacts of violent conflict on Kenya's social fabric, this study includes survey research that is designed to elicit respondents perceptions of institutional and inter-group trust. Faith in national and local institutions is crucial for successful governance. Yet, this form of trust can be limited by the uneven provision of public goods, including security, as a result of preferential treatment granted to certain population by individuals in leadership roles. In a context where many researchers emphasize powerful exclusive social ties, this project is designed to examine the degree to which ethnic communities trust one another. It is expected that these relationships have been influenced by communal conflict, but, more importantly, research in the behavioral sciences has shown that social distance between populations can elevate the risk of future conflict within a society. <br/><br/>Previous research has shown that all too often elections in African states are marred by political violence. Conflict can occur in the form of pre-election intimidation campaigns to stifle voter turnout, or as post-election retribution carried out by a group who feel victimized by accusations of ballot manipulation. This research contributes to scholarship on a pervasive social concern by applying a new and diverse suite of spatial methods to the Kenyan political landscape. Results of the project will provide insight into the dynamics of violence in Kenya at local scales and will also be able to characterize Kenya's social fabric as the 2012 election approaches.

Study of single-molecule interaction with NW is enabled by physically limiting attachment of only single or few molecules on the nano-dot of self-assembled monolayers. Using this sensor platform, a comprehensive understanding of electronic biosensing mechanisms, ultimate sensitivity, and bio-abio interfaces down to single-molecule level will be developed. Correlations between device physics, surface chemistry, and sensor performance at molecular scale will be investigated. These insights will be leveraged to develop advanced modulated sensing strategies, such as pH-modulated sensing, multi-channel detection and mapping of protein specific activity vs. cross-reactivity, to improve detection specificity. If successful, the proposed methods will lead to an innovative and manufacturable nanoelectronic bio-chip for label-free biosensing with single-molecule sensitivity and high specificity. <br/><br/>Intellectual merits:<br/> The proposed study of ultimate capability of electronic bio-sensor down to the single-molecule level will significantly advance the understanding of electronic biosensing and provide guidance for future sensor design. This challenging study is enabled by an innovative and reliable biosensor using a patterned monolayer nano-dot as binding interface for a quantum wire transistor defined by lithography. The use of nanolithography to define the nanowires with size (2-10 nm) comparable to those by chemical synthesis will provide better uniformity, device reliability, and manufacturability. It allows in-situ integration with CMOS circuitry on chip. The proposed techniques combining protein titration signature (pH-dependence) with modulated biasing and data analysis with semi-orthogonal mapping of protein specific activity and promiscuous activity to improve specificity are novel and highly transformative. By combining the studies of ultimate sensitivity and specificity, the correlation between them will be investigated, leading to the establishment of critical design rules for electronic biosensor. <br/><br/>Broader impacts<br/>The proposed molecular-scale biosensor and comprehensive understanding of electronic interaction between nanoelectronic devices and bio-molecules at single-molecule level will contribute to the fields of biosensors, nanoelectronics, nanofabrication, and molecular electronics. Improved electronic sensors as a general platform could have a considerable impact on a wide-range of biochemical detection and disease diagnostics including pathogen/virus detection, gene expression, immune-screening, whole blood analysis, as well as home land security. It provides a single-chip biosensing solution desired for point of care detection and diagnostics to overcome the limitations of current optical sensors that require bulky and expensive equipment, labeling, complex sample preparation, and long processing time. The program will utilize a concept of ?e-Biosensor Discovery Kit? to generate significant educational impact, including integration of research and education, promoting diversity, and outreach to K-12, underrepresented women and the Hispanic student body at UTD and local community colleges as well as the workforce in the Dallas and Fort/Worth area.

However, it is not known how ssDNA viruses could mutate rapidly, given that they replicate by using the high-fidelity DNA polymerases of their host cells. One source of mutation that does not involve polymerase errors is spontaneous chemical degradation of DNA bases. Because ssDNA viruses spend more time single-stranded than single-stranded RNA viruses, their DNA bases are more susceptible to oxidative damage.  The most frequent kind of such damage is the deamination of cytosine into uracil, which can lead to mutations of cytosine to thymine when the DNA is replicated.  It has already been shown that ssDNA viruses have much higher than expected rates of C to T transitions during their long-term evolution, and this project will investigate whether or not the higher mutation rates of ssDNA viruses is indeed caused by higher C to T mutation rates.  The absolute and relative mutation rate of cytosine to the other bases in a model ssDNA virus, bacteriophage phiX174, will be determined.  The intellectual merit of this work is its novel cytosine-specific mutation assay, and the combination of phenotypic mutation assays with mutation accumulation studies. <br/><br/>This research has the potential for significant broader impacts. An increased understanding of ssDNA viral evolution, and whether or not it is biased towards mutation at cytosines, will allow the design of more complex, but biologically realistic models of mutation that are necessary for accurate molecular epidemiology of emerging ssDNA viruses of plants and animals.  As cellular genomes also show evidence of mutation due to chemical degradation (especially in highly transcribed genes, which spend significant time single stranded), these more complex nucleotide substitution models might prove useful in bioinformatic analyses of eukaryotic genes. Most importantly, increased understanding of ssDNA mutational biases could be exploited to combat current and future outbreaks of these emerging pathogens. Additionally, this project contributes to the education and representation of women in science on both graduate and undergraduate levels (in collaboration with the Douglass Project for Women in Science, Math and Engineering).

The investigators are examining the process of wood decomposition because it accounts for the majority of C loss following fire. They will identify the community structure of wood-decay fungi and observe how the community changes in response to fire and with time since fire. They are using observational and experimental studies in conjunction with molecular techniques to study the fungal communities and connect them to decomposition rates.<br/> An understanding of how stand-replacing wildfires alter ecosystem C is critical to formulating C predictions throughout the western U.S. This information is even more significant in light of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and climate changes that have led to larger, more frequent catastrophic wildfires. This type of fire emits large amounts of CO2 and leaves a vast legacy of dead wood, which releases CO2 long after the fire. Although it is known that wood decay fungi are a major component of C cycles, the extent that severe fires affect the species composition of these fungi, and how the species composition influences rates of wood decay are poorly understood.

The course materials reflect advanced manufacturing processes recently adopted by industry and state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies and have the potential for significant near-term impact on industry. The course is taught simultaneously at all three universities and the students are collaborating across university boundaries and so the project includes significant efforts in the design and development of collaborative teaching and learning mechanisms. The evaluation, being conducted by an experienced evaluator, is examining the effectiveness of the instructional material and strategies and the effect on student learning. The project team is disseminating through website postings, conference presentations, and journal publications.   Broader impacts include the dissemination of the instructional materials and results.
0949420	Collaborative Research:  Nutrient co-limitation in young and mature northern hardwood forests	DEB	ECOSYSTEM STUDIES	07/01/2010	06/21/2010	Edward Rastetter	MA	Marine Biological Laboratory	Standard Grant	Henry L.

Experimental tests of N vs. phosphorus (P) limitation in temperate forest systems are lacking.  This study will combine modeling and field studies to explore processes mediating nutrient colimitation in relation to successional change in managed hardwood forest ecosystems.  An improved understanding of ecosystem optimization of resource use, including the maintenance of co-limitation, is important to forest management, environmental protection, and basic scientific knowledge. Balanced nutrient cycling is essential to maintaining forest sustainability, and scientists and managers at the White Mountain National Forest will evaluate silvicultural practices in light of results from the proposed research.  For example, their forest management plans require justifying intensive harvest removals in terms of the ability of forests to acquire nutrients for regrowth.  Feedbacks such as the biological enhancement of mineral weathering when nutrients are limiting are clearly relevant to this appraisal.<br/>The Multi-Element Limitation (MEL) model represents co-limitation from the perspective of resource optimization theory and ecosystem biogeochemistry. We have extended the model to include P as well as N, carbon, light, and water, and applied it to simulate primary and secondary succession in northern hardwood forests. Using nutrient additions of N alone in some forest stands, P alone in some forest stands, N+P in some forest stands,  in replicated stands of three ages (~20, 30, and > 100 years) at the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, we will test the patterns of resource limitation predicted by the model and multiple mechanisms of allocation of effort to acquire N and P.  Specifically, the model predicts a greater response of aboveground productivity to N+P than N or P alone. In older stands, it predicts a greater response to N than to P addition, but in younger stands, the model suggests that the supply of N from detritus should be sufficient to create P limitation.
0943599	Collaborative Research: Present and future contribution of glacial runoff to freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska	EAR	HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES	06/15/2010	06/10/2010	Eran Hood	AK	University of Alaska Southeast Juneau Campus	Standard Grant	Thomas Torgersen	05/31/2014	$84,728.00		eran.hood@uas.alaska.edu	11066 Auke Lake Way	Juneau	AK	998010000	9077966494	GEO	1579	9150	$0.00	Freshwater influx to the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) is strongly influenced by glacier runoff as roughly one fifth of its drainage basin is covered by glacier ice. During the last decades GOA glaciers have generally thinned and retreated and hence precipitation stored in the glaciers as snow and ice has been released augmenting streamflow and freshwater influx to the Gulf of Alaska. Glaciers draining to the GOA are highly sensitive to climate warming and mass loss rates are expected to increase. It is hypothesized that runoff from glaciers will initially increase by more than 50% as wastage accelerates, but then will reach a turning point upon which runoff will decrease as the glaciers shrink and partly disappear. Hence, the changes in the hydrological cycles due to glacier wastage are substantially larger than expected changes in any other component of the water budget in this region.<br/><br/>The research will quantify these changes in runoff. A glacier runoff model is used to simulate the current magnitude and timing of runoff from glaciers that drain to the Gulf of Alaska and project how glacial runoff along the Gulf of Alaska will change by 2100 in response to future climate scenarios in Alaska downscaled by a high resolution regional climate model. Further, potential changes to the biogeochemical fluxes into freshwater and marine ecosystems associated with the projected changes in glacier runoff are assessed. Results provide regional scale estimates of glacier runoff changes and associated impacts on biogeochemical fluxes for the GOA. A modeling strategy is developed that can be used to evaluate glacier runoff changes and hydrologic ?tipping points? in other heavily glacierized regions. Moreover, the downscaled climate scenarios we develop will be available for other impact studies. Visualization products of the results are made available to the Mendenhall Glacier visitor center, which is visited by approximately 350,000 people each year.

Two enabling technologies are of particular interest to these institutions: visualization and energy-conscious networked cluster computing.  The NSF-supported UCSD OptIPuter/OptiPortal and GreenLight projects are now ready for broader deployment across the US. Researchers from a dozen MSI institutions have asked for hands-on experience at UCSD.  This project provides participants with technical background and best practices on the GreenLight Instrument for computing and installing, maintaining, and using OptIPortals for advanced telepresence and visualization. <br/><br/>Project GreenLight officially partners with the NSF Minority-Serving Institutions CyberInfrastructure Coalition (MSI-CIEC), which has held three workshops (to date) at UC San Diego. The organizations that comprise the Alliance for Equity in Higher Education, the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), and the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO), established the MSI-CIEC to promote, encourage and facilitate the meaningful engagement of minority-serving institutions in cyberinfrastructure. The GreenLight Instrument enables application scientists to understand how to make greener choices, while still exploiting the exponential growth of computing, storage, and networking required for them to continue to compete globally on frontier scientific research. The GreenLight Instrument helps campuses and users understand how to take advantage of novel renewable and off-grid energy/cooling sources as well as employ middleware that automates optimal choice of cluster compute/storage/power strategies. The overall result is both cost and energy savings to campuses, valuable results for all institutions but essential for minority-serving institutions which often operate with far lower operating budgets than their majority-serving 4-year college counterparts.

A comprehensive mathematical framework will be developed for describing the control of fluid flows at low Reynolds number through localized cyclic boundary deformations using concepts from differential geometry and dynamical systems theory. A high-fidelity numerical approach will be developed for simulating such problems using a viscous vortex particle method. A pair of experimental platforms on contrasting physical scales will be constructed, each comprising a system of reconfigurable resonant probes mimicking cilia observed in nature, and extensive data will be collected to calibrate both theoretical and computational models. Algorithmic methods for separating and sorting particles, and for tailoring the spatial trajectories of individual particles, will be devised and demonstrated experimentally. <br/><br/>The project focuses on developing and demonstrating a novel technique for separating and manipulating fragile microscopic objects immersed in fluids, which has a growing list of applications ranging from the mechanical testing of macromolecules like DNA to the assisted fertilization of human ova with immotile sperm to the sustained excitation of fluid-borne abrasive particles for the precision machining of brittle surfaces. Models will be developed to predict the trajectories of particles in fluids containing multiple vortex fields. These vortex fields will be produced experimentally using oscillating fibers. A pair of experimental platforms with millimeter and micrometer (1/1000 of a millimeter) physical scales will be constructed. For each platform, a system of reconfigurable resonant probes will be used to generate steady vortex fields in particle-bearing fluids. The smallest probes will mimic the microscopic oscillating cilia observed in nature. Data will be collected to validate the theoretical and computational predictive models. This project will not only engender integrated advancements in applied mathematics, computational science, and engineering, but will also shed light on the physics underlying a physiological design present in protozoa and humans alike. The micromanipulation method to be developed represents an improvement over alternative technologies in simplicity, portability, and cost. The PIs' plan for developing this method incorporates a multi-institutional collaboration involving the directed mentoring of at least one postdoctoral researcher, at least two PhD students, and a number of undergraduates (with a deliberate eye toward promoting diversity), the curricular expansion of two cross-disciplinary graduate courses and two undergraduate courses at the PIs' universities, and outreach to biology students at a third university and to high school students in an ethnically diverse area.

Scaling Up is a program of research and development that will enable virtual organizations in the Earth sciences to scale to massive interdisciplinary communities of communities.  A key element is commodity governance, which encodes social and technical aspects of governance in cyberinfrastructure to create virtual units capable of operating, aggregating, and coordinating in a decentralized fashion.  This is a deeply integrative effort that synthesizes expertise in the physical sciences, computer science, political science, social science, and software engineering to propose a strategy for governing large-scale Earth science modeling collaborations that are technically, scientifically, and socially complex.<br/>  <br/>Investigators will conduct a sociotechnical study of three interlinked modeling projects in climate, weather, and surface dynamics, and formulate a conceptual framework that addresses the requirements, structures, and policies of virtual organizations in these and similar modeling domains as a basis for commodity governance implementation.  Commodity governance units will be implemented on a base of cyberinfrastructure projects that are emerging as a means for expressing modeling activities as end-to-end workflows, accessible through science gateways.  The units will be disseminated through the base cyberinfrastructure and demonstrated, to the extent possible, in the target modeling projects.  It will be fully utilized in a pilot project focused on the intercomparison of atmospheric dynamical cores.<br/><br/>The commoditized governance elements, as their name implies, are expected to be applicable to many modeling virtual organizations, including disciplines such as space weather, ecosystem modeling and fusion.  Products of the collaboration will be incorporated into and distributed with the widely used cyberinfrastructure products generated by the Earth System Grid and Earth System Modeling Framework, and introduced to the extent possible into several large virtual organizations.  A pilot project that will demonstrate extensive use of tools and concepts introduced by the collaboration will involve graduate students in exemplary processes for model development - the careful, exhaustive analysis of specific components through rigorous collaborative testing.  Commodity governance itself is intended to be a powerful democratizing force in the modeling community, as it lowers barriers of entry for smaller and marginalized groups by encouraging accessibility to modeling artifacts and transparent, decentralized decision making processes.  The domain in which the proposed work is focusing - the interrelationships of climate, weather, and surface processes - is a key to understanding and addressing critical societal questions about the effects of climate change.

It will provide multi-gigabit bandwidth and services connecting researchers in the US with their counterparts in Asia and utilizing the current technological advances in those areas. <br/><br/>The research and education networks included in the TransPAC3 collaboration cover all of Asia excluding only North Korea, Brunei, Myanmar, and Mongolia. Indiana University will lead the TransPAC3 Collaboration in a cooperative partnership with the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN), Delivery of Advanced Network Technology to Europe (DANTE), and in coordination with Internet2 and other research and education networks that are interconnected through the project. The collaboration in Asia will connect to the APAN XP in Tokyo directly, and from there to 15 countries in Asia. TransPAC3 will connect to China via Hong Kong and the CNHI Exchange Point and to the Trans-Eurasian Information Network (TEIN3) network via Singapore.  The TEIN3 network currently provides connectivity to 12 Asian countries and Europe with 7 additional countries soon to be connected. DANTE is the operator of the TEIN3 network in North, South East, and South Asia and connects almost all countries in those parts of Asia.<br/><br/>TransPAC3 will initially deploy 20 Gbps of bandwidth between Asia and the US using 10G carrier service offerings. TransPAC3 will deploy one 10 Gbps link between Pacific Wave and Tokyo in years 1 and 2. A second 10 Gbps link will be provided by NICT, Japan, at no cost to NSF.  In Year 3 of the award this will be expanded as demand and pricing evolve.  As 40Gbps and 100Gbps become available and affordable at trans-Pacific distance they will become part of the provided service.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>This proposal rests well within the guidelines of the IRNC solicitation and will expand and enhance services in security, identity management, measurement, and operational integration.  US ? Asia connectivity requires close cooperation between the participants, and this project will consist of a collaborative team.  Security is a major issue for all concerned and is a focus of the proposal.  The PI has proposed and intends to provide deployment of accurate and useful measurement technology as well as leading edge circuit services to meet high bandwidth applications.  Eliminating duplication of expensive links should decrease overall costs.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>As with the previous IRNC award, it is expected that the awardee?s TransPAC3 collaboration will provide highly expanded opportunities for US researchers to interact and collaborate with their fellow researchers in Asia.  The PI?s recent cooperation in connecting Pakistan to the global R&E infrastructure continues to show fruitful results.  <br/><br/>Integrating diversity in research and education is a strong component in this proposal.  The PI has plans to partner with the Gerald L. Bepko Internship Program at Indiana University to extend educational outreach and integrate diversity into the TransPAC3 project, with the goal to identify, connect, and work with underserved students and advance their knowledge and ability in information technology.

TL/PW will present a unified connectivity face toward the West for all US R&E networks including Internet2, National Lambda Rail and Federal agency networks, enabling general and specific peerings with more than 15 international R&E links, including those funded by other NSF IRNC projects, serving scores of countries.  Distributed peering services at network Layers 1, 2 and 3 will allow the project to seamlessly support domain-specific projects while remaining committed to equitable shared global R&E network services.  TL/PW will work with Internet2, National Lambda Rail, the other IRNC awardees and international networks to provide seamless evolutionary production networking services to the international research community.  The value of TL/PW to the nation and the world is demonstrated by the fact that TL/PW is not proposing to buy new international links.  Rather, TL/PW funding will be used to provide domestic backhaul, hosting, support and facilitation for those engaged in R&E networking in the region. <br/><br/>TL/PW will provide domestic support for AARNet's SX-TransPORT project, which provides two 10Gbps circuits from Australia to Hawaii to the West Coast of the U.S. on the Southern Cross Cable Network submarine fiber system.  This project not only connects Australia's R&E networking community but also provides connectivity for the world's premiere setting for astronomical observatories, the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii.  The Mauna Kea observatories comprise over $1 billion of international investment by 13 countries in some of the most important cyberinfrastructure resources in the world.  TL/PW will also continue to advance and support research network connections in the Australasia and Pacific regions.<br/><br/>The Intellectual Merit of TL/PW derives from its championing of end-to-end connectivity and network advancement that stimulates innovation among leading domain scientists and cyberinfrastructure engineers.  TL/PW has innovated to create the world's model distributed exchange serving the global R&E networking community, and will continue to advance reliable and cost-effective global cyberinfrastructure to meet broader research and education needs. TL/PW will focus on emerging network-enabled sustainable services, like cloud computing, and will take on a special leadership role to support major international scientific cyberinfrastructure in areas unique to its service area: astronomy and ocean observatories. TL/PW will enable the advancement of scientific discovery, and in so doing, advance the state of cyberinfrastructure-empowered research and education.<br/><br/>The Broader Impact of TL/PW will result from its sweeping enablement of US researchers to easily collaborate with their colleagues in many of the fastest-developing parts of the world. TL/PW is superbly positioned to support global access to large-scale international sensor networks like the NSF-funded Ocean Observatories Initiative and the substantial international investment in telescopes that comprise the Mauna Kea Observatories.  Working with major commercial players, including Amazon and Microsoft, TL/PW will actively advance the state of cloud computing services that investigators will increasingly apply in their research as a greener and more cost-effective approach to cyberinfrastructure deployment. TL/PW also plans to leverage its unique positioning to extend R&E networking into the Pacific Islands, which are central to understanding the global phenomena of climate change, sea-level rise and ocean acidification.

It addresses the fundamental questions of interaction between flows of electrically conducting fluids and magnetic fields. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The project advances our understanding of flows of electrically conducting fluids affected by magnetic fields. The main attention will be given to typical technological and laboratory flows of liquid metals and oxide melts. Model flows in a rectangular duct will be used to investigate how the magnetic field affects the transition to turbulence and properties of turbulent flows, in particular, their ability to transport heat and admixtures. On the basis of the acquired understanding, the PI will search for optimal control methods of electromagnetic flow. <br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/><br/>The results of the research are expected to advance the understanding, modeling, and optimization of the processing of electromagnetic materials, such as steel, aluminum, and semi-conductor crystals, as well as for the design of lithium cooling blankets for future nuclear fusion reactors. In all such technological processes, optimization of the field flow interaction is a key to reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact. <br/><br/>The project will foster a competitive research environment and dynamic innovative instruction at the University of Michigan Dearborn, an institution focused on serving the metropolitan Detroit community. A graduate and several undergraduate students will be trained in the fields of turbulence theory, magnetohydrodynamics, and computational modeling. Close international cooperation strengthens the research and will establish new ties between the U.S. and German science communities.

This realization has motivated significant research in the area of process control to ensure safe and efficient process operation. Traditionally, control systems rely on centralized control architectures utilizing dedicated, wired links to measurement sensors and control actuators to regulate appropriate process variables at desired values. While this paradigm to process control has been successful, when the number of the process state variables, manipulated inputs and measurements in a chemical plant becomes large - a common occurrence in modern plants -, the computational time needed for the solution of the centralized control problem may increase significantly and may impede the ability of centralized control systems (particularly when nonlinear constrained optimization-based control systems like model predictive control-MPC are used), to carry out real-time calculations within the limits set by process dynamics and operating conditions. One feasible alternative to overcome this problem is to utilize cooperative, distributed control architectures in which the manipulated inputs are computed by solving more than one control (optimization) problem in separate processors in a coordinated fashion. However, the rigorous design of cooperative, distributed control architectures for nonlinear processes is a challenging task that cannot be addressed with traditional process control methods dealing with the design of centralized control systems. To design cooperative, distributed control systems, key fundamental issues that need to be addressed include the design of the individual control systems and of their communication strategy so that they efficiently cooperate in achieving the closed-loop plant objectives, as well as the development of efficient strategies for fault detection, isolation and management.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/><br/>Motivated by the above considerations, the objective of this research program is to develop the theory and methods needed for the design and monitoring of cooperative, distributed control systems for large-scale nonlinear processes and demonstrate their application and effectiveness in the context of process systems of industrial importance.  Rigorous methods and architectures will be developed for the design of cooperative, distributed control systems accounting explicitly for the effect of asynchronous and delayed measurements, and novel monitoring and reconfigurable fault-tolerant control strategies will be developed to deal with actuator/sensor/controller failures. Specifically, the research projects include: <br/>1) Design of cooperative, distributed control systems for nonlinear processes using Lyapunov-based model predictive control techniques; control system architecture, model uncertainty and state estimation issues will be explicitly addressed, <br/>2) Design of fault-detection and isolation systems for cooperative, distributed control systems, <br/>3) Development of reconfigurable fault-tolerant control strategies accounting explicitly for stability, performance and robustness considerations, and <br/>4) Applications to simulated and lab-scale process systems of importance to chemical and water industries.<br/><br/>Broader Impact <br/><br/>The development of cooperative, distributed control system design and monitoring methods for large-scale nonlinear processes is expected to significantly improve the operation and performance of chemical processes, increase process safety and reliability, and minimize the negative economic impact of process failures, thereby impacting directly the US economy. The integration of the research results into advanced-level classes in process control and operations and the writing of a new book on ?Fault-Tolerant Process Control? will benefit students and researchers in the field. The development of software, short courses and workshops and the on-going participation in the Abnormal Situation Management (ASM) Consortium will be the means for transferring the results of this research into the industrial sector. Furthermore, the involvement of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in the research through participation in the Center for Engineering Education and Diversity (CEED) at UCLA, and outreach to the California State Polytechnic University in Pomona by offering summer internships to highly-qualified students, will be pursued. Finally, the research will benefit from and contribute to educational initiatives and innovations on the UCLA campus in the area of information technology directed by the co-PI.

This work employs a novel theoretical approach for the statistical mechanics of liquids, the quasi-classical theory (QCT).  The QCT partitions the excess chemical potential into three contributions by enacting a spatial partitioning with a hard-sphere constraint: 1) the cavity free energy for digging a hole in the solvent 2) the free energy for placing the solute into the cavity, and 3) the free energy to release the hard-sphere constraint, allowing direct contact between the solute and solvent. For ion solvation problems, step 2) above yields the largest contribution to the hydration free energy.  It was found that a mean-field estimate of this term is quite accurate.   This method permits computations of free energies at the quantum mechanical level, and in binding sites in proteins.<br/><br/>Specific ion or Hofmeister effects are very important in a wide array of chemical, physical, and biological systems, for example the swelling of  biological membranes,  solvation free energies and activities, surface tension increments, bubble interactions, ion channel transport, colloid interactions, pH measurements, buffer behavior and protein folding and stability.  Professor Beck is involved in organizing a workshop on ions in chemistry and biology to be held in Telluride CO.  He is also heavily involved in undergraduate and graduate curriculum development.
0948320	Estimating and communicating climate impacts on groundwater and surface water resources in northern Mozambique	EAR	EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES	08/01/2010	05/25/2011	Michele Minihane	WA	Minihane, Michele R	Continuing grant	Lina C. Patino	07/31/2013	$170,000.00				Seattle	WA	98115		GEO	1575	7137	$0.00	Dr. Michele R Minihane has been granted the NSF Earth Sciences postdoctoral fellowship to carry out a research and education plan at the University of Washington, Seattle. The project will quantify the impacts of changing climate on the future availability of groundwater and surface water in a region with limited historic hydrological measurements and communicate the potential changes in a meaningful way to the local community and planners. The research will combine remote sensing data, field measurements, and personal interviews to build and calibrate a regional-scale hydrologic model for northern Mozambique. Downscaled data from global climate circulation models will provide inputs for future hydrologic conditions allowing the model to estimate the impacts of climate scenarios on water resource availability in the region. The research will be conducted in collaboration with individuals living and working in Mozambique to both increase community support and to facilitate more effective in-country dissemination of results. Today, access to clean water is a pressing challenge in many parts of the world, including areas in southeastern Africa, will likely become more water-stressed in the future. To further complicate the challenges, these regions typically lack the reliable long-term hydrologic datasets used for water resources planning. This project will address both needs by developing methods to evaluate current groundwater and surface water resource availability from limited available data and by creating models to quantify the local future water availability with climate change. The project will potentially directly impact water resources planning in northern Mozambique, making it easier for local policy makers to understand and predict water availability in the region and thereby providing health and economic benefits to the region. A critical piece of this work will be development of strategies to effectively communicate these results to the local communities and water resources planners. Results will also be shared with non-governmental organizations and donor agencies interested in improving health and economic conditions in rural Africa. The study will focus on provinces in northern Mozambique, but the modeling methodologies and communications strategies developed will be broadly applicable to other regions in Africa and around the world. The results will also be shared through a publicly available website and through collaborations and conferences in Africa and the United States.
1041763	Topics in Pure and Applied Harmonic Analysis	DMS	ANALYSIS PROGRAM	01/31/2010	06/22/2010	Leonid Slavin	OH	University of Cincinnati Main Campus	Standard Grant	Bruce P. Palka	06/30/2011	$66,728.00		leonid.slavin@uc.edu	University Hall, Suite 530	Cincinnati	OH	452210222	5135564358	MPS	1281	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project is devoted to blending and intertwining methods typically attributable to either applied or theoretical aspect of modern Harmonic Analysis, in an effort to solve several long-standing problems, develop important cross-field techniques, and produce meaningful applications. One part of the project deals with the behavior of certain approximation/interpolation processes as their order tends to infinity, a recently developed variant of the Poisson summation formula involving irregular samples, and the regularity properties of solutions of certain boundary value problems. The other part applies the Bellman function method to computing the operator norms of the maximal function on Lebesgue spaces in non-martingale settings, the Riesz transforms on the space BMO, and the generalized Beurling-Ahlfors transform on differential forms; in addition, an extension of earlier sharp results for the John-Nirenberg inequality is studied.<br/><br/>Among the practical areas that may be directly affected by the project are the fields of image and signal processing, including applications to medical tomography. The successful completion of this research should lead to improved methods for accumulation, transmission, and representation of various types of data. Studying the regularity properties of solutions of partial differential equations (PDE) is a fundamental step on the way to using those PDE to describe physical phenomena; such use is widespread and necessary in physics, chemistry, biology, material science, etc. In turn, the computation of norms of important operators, such as the Riesz transforms, allows one to estimate the size of solutions of various PDE.  The Bellman function method itself links such computation to the existence of positive solutions to certain differential equations. On the other hand, the theoretical synergy, which is at the heart of the project, will result in the development of novel powerful techniques, affecting applied as well as pure aspects of Fourier analysis. Another important impact of this research is on education: the results, diverse and far-reaching, will be presented in courses and seminars on different levels, from advanced undergraduate to the doctoral.

The proposed sensor will consist of an innovative debris separator based on surface acoustic standing waves that sorts debris particles by size and delivers them to appropriately-sized detectors, and a parallel array of inductive Coulter counting detectors that enables rapid analysis of a large volume of lubricants. This work is expected to lead to an advanced sensor that has high throughput, high sensitivity, high dynamic range and low cost. It will facilitate better maintenance scheduling for a variety of machinery including bearings, gearboxes, and turbomachinery, thereby significantly reducing the cost of machine operation. In addition, this project also aims to develop and deploy MEMS and sensing technology-related educational materials and contribute to motivating K-12 students and students from underrepresented groups to pursue STEM careers. Undergraduate students will be recruited, with an emphasis on underrepresented minorities and women, to conduct research in this project.  Through hands-on activities added to existing summer workshops, middle school and high school students and their teachers will be exposed to cutting-edge MEMS and advanced sensor technologies.

Thompson  ORG: Clemson University<br/><br/>Title:  Symposium - ACS POLY - Bioactive Polymer and Polymer Surfaces<br/><br/>INTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  This proposal seeks to support travel awards for graduate students, post-docs, and younger faculty, including those from underrepresented groups to attend the symposium on ?Bioactive Polymers and Polymer Surfaces? at the 240th American Chemical Society (ACS) National meeting in Boston, MA (August 22-26, 2010) in the Division of Polymer Chemistry (POLY).  Bioactive polymers and polymer surfaces have the potential to improve the efficacy of, and establish entirely new, medical therapeutics and devices.  Towards this goal, new bioactive polymer systems are increasingly being studied in an attempt to understand and eventually harness polymeric material-guided cell and tissue behavior. The objectives of the symposium are:  (1) To highlight recent advances in the design, synthesis, and characterization of bioactive polymers and polymer surfaces to understand the interaction between cells, tissues, and polymeric materials and to translate this into practical applications in biomedical engineering.  (2) To promote dialogue among polymer scientists, chemists, bioengineers, pharmaceutical scientists, and biologists, and to establish contacts and exchange ideas among workers in these different areas.  (3) To provide opportunities for young investigators including junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate students, to present their most recent research results.  The PI makes a good case for the timeliness of the proposed symposium in the context of other conferences/symposia on related topics.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  Two of the three symposium organizers are females, and a number of female and minority scientists are scheduled to make presentations at the symposium.  At least five of the scheduled speakers are younger scientists.  The requested funding of $4000 is scheduled entirely to support the attendance (travel, lodging, meals) of graduate students, postdocs, and younger faculty.  Funding priority will be given to graduate students attending their first national meeting, junior faculty giving an oral presentation, and researchers belonging to underrepresented groups. The existence of potential funding for student travel will be described in advertisements for the symposium to enhance student interest.

Charles Ying	06/30/2014	$308,248.00		tsybesko@njit.edu	University Heights	Newark	NJ	071021982	9735965275	MPS	1775	6863, 7237, 7969, 9161, AMPP	$0.00	This project develops and fabricates Silicon (Si)/Si-Germanium(Ge) nanostructures with Ge concentration approaching 50% and abrupt Si/SiGe heterointerfaces.  The goal is to demonstrate a prototype of a CMOS-compatible light emitter and, possibly, a laser operating in the near infrared. Recently, the PI showed that in Si/SiGe nanostructures with Ge concentration greater than 20% and low structural defect density, the process of light emission is fully controlled by Si/SiGe heterointerfaces. In these nanostructures, type II energy band alignment and diffused Si/SiGe heterointerfaces (due to Si/SiGe intermixing) are responsible for electron and hole spatial separation and slow radiative recombination. At moderate and high carrier concentration, this slow recombination cannot compete with Auger processes, and luminescence quantum efficiency decreases drastically. <br/>In this project, they will utilize a fabrication technique based on rapid thermal low-pressure chemical vapor deposition and fabricate Ge-rich Si/SiGe nanostructures with low defect density and abrupt heterointerfaces. In these nanostructures, electron and hole wavefunction overlap will be enhanced and radiative recombination will be accelerated by many orders of magnitude. The research plan is focused on (a) fabrication and detailed structural characterization of Ge-rich Si/SiGe nano-layers with abrupt heterointerfaces; (b) strain engineering in these nanostructures and application of strain for modification of energy band alignment at Si/SiGe heterointerfaces; (c) experimental studies and modeling of carrier recombination at abrupt and strained Si/SiGe heterointerfaces; and (d) demonstration of photonic device prototypes including optically and electrically pumped light emitters and, possibly, lasers. <br/><br/>This research project is focused on the development of CMOS compatible, high efficiency light emitters and lasers. If successful, this project will become the milestone achievement in the longtime search for successful light source integration into the CMOS environment. The project also includes comprehensive training of NJIT graduate and undergraduate students in the strategically important areas of semiconductor nanotechnology; integration of research and education, and promotion of a partnership between a public university in New Jersey, Hewlett Packard Research Laboratories in Palo Alto, CA and National Research Council of Canada. An important component of this research project is public education in nanotechnology and outreach efforts to underrepresented groups in science and technology via lectures, demonstrations, laboratory tours and summer research programs for high-school students and teachers in Newark and New Jersey Metropolitan Area.
1041476	EAGER:  Transforming Everyday Social Activity Coordination Through Mobile Outeraction-Support Systems	IIS	Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)	06/15/2010	06/17/2010	Quentin Jones	NJ	New Jersey Institute of Technology	Standard Grant	Ephraim P. Glinert	05/31/2012	$149,991.00		qjones@njit.edu	University Heights	Newark	NJ	071021982	9735965275	CSE	7367	7916	$0.00	One of the primary uses of interpersonal communication channels such as texting, instant messaging and mobile phone conversations is to coordinate social activities, such as the planning of a future face-to-face meeting.  The PI has coined the term outeraction to refer to the communicative processes used by people to manage future interactions (interactions about future interactions).  Yet while outeraction is often primarily conducted through mobile communication, existing mobile applications provide limited or ineffective outeraction-support.  This results in people investing a lot of effort into coordinating everyday activities using unstructured serial communication between relevant parties, thereby wasting a significant amount of time.  The PI argues that the potential for the ever increasing adoption of smart phones to transform everyday social coordination through the systematic development of mobile outeraction-support systems is hampered, because to date outeraction-support system building has lacked a firm foundation.  There are few conceptual frameworks, little empirical knowledge of user requirements and attitudes, and the efficacy of system designs has not been established.  Thus, despite more than 20 years of CSCW research into coordination processes, researchers have yet to instantiate a mobile outeraction-support system that demonstrates a systematic understanding of the overall design space and provides outeraction-support by complementing existing group norms for coordination.  The broad goal of this EAGER is to lay the foundation, through the instantiation of innovative software that embodies lessons learned from studies into everyday social coordination practices, for future work that will significantly expand our knowledge of how to design mobile outeraction-support systems.  A particular focus will be to address people's desire for a shared view of the status of the activity planning process (e.g., knowing who can come to an event at a particular time).  As part of the research plan, the PI will conduct a series of laboratory and field studies in which he will explore issues such as the importance of reachablity and locatablity of actors and resources to the social activity coordination and negotiation process, the extent to which  negotiations / conversations regarding key components of a social activity (its 'what', 'where', 'when', 'why', and 'how') can be scaffolded or require open discourse between actors, and the types of group interaction management (floor) controls individuals often use to organize social activities (current event management software often assumes a single event organizer and provides floor controls that match that assumption, even though everyday experience suggests that social coordination is often far more democratic and ad hoc).  Each of the studies will be associated with extensive software application development, which will exploit and build upon the hardware resources made available at the PI's institution through the NSF-sponsored SmartCampus mobile social computing system testbed.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Using computer technology to improve people's ability to engage in social activities of interest and coordinate with others is a simple way to increase our social connectivity.   This is important, because individuals embedded in richly connected social environments are better able to handle personal setbacks such as financial failures and illness, and to provide social support for others.  Therefore, developing mechanisms for the deployment of mobile outeraction-support systems, so that we are able to more effectively coordinate with one another, is important for society as a whole.
0965624	A Priori Analysis of Subgrid Molecular Transport Effects on High Pressure Turbulent Combustion Modeling	CBET	THERMAL TRANSPORT PROCESSES, Combustion & Fire Systems	07/01/2010	06/17/2010	Richard Miller	SC	Clemson University	Standard Grant	Ruey-Hung Chen	12/31/2013	$220,694.00		rm@clemson.edu	230 Kappa Street	CLEMSON	SC	296345701	8646562424	ENG	1406, 1407	047E, 057E, 061E, 063E, 064E, 9150	$0.00	Miller<br/>0965624<br/><br/>This proposal addresses subgrid statistics of turbulent flames under realistic high pressure thermodynamic conditions relevant to modern diesel engines, gas turbines, and rocket engines. The research will utilize massively parallel direct numerical simulations (DNS), in which all length and time scales of the turbulent flame are fully resolved using high order accurate techniques and without the use of turbulence or subgrid models, to analyze several high pressure flames. The particular focus is on analyzing terms relevant to modern combustion models with emphasis on large eddy simulation (LES) and filtered density function (FDF) approaches. High pressure experiments are difficult and existing DNS validations of these approaches have thus far not addressed four coupled phenomena that can be highly important in real flames: large pressure, realistic chemistry, real property models, and generalized heat and mass diffusion.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/><br/>It is hypothesized that localized subgrid molecular mixing effects, which are often assumed to be negligible relative to turbulent stirring, can have a substantial impact on high pressure flame dynamics. This is due to the fact that ultimately many flames are controlled locally by the diffusion of species and temperature. Extinction and re-ignition events are highly sensitive to local flame conditions and Soret cross-diffusion is also highly amplified at high pressures. DNS will therefore be conducted for hydrogen-oxygen, hydrogen-air, heptane-air, and methane-air reacting shear layers. Both detailed and reduced chemical kinetics, a real gas state equation, real property evaluations, and a complete generalized diffusion model will be incorporated. Massively parallel simulations will produce a database for each flame at various pressures and Reynolds numbers. The database will then be explored in an a priori manner to analyze subgrid terms and statistics related to LES and FDF of high pressure turbulent combustion. Terms requiring modeling will be identified and modeled as appropriate.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/><br/>The research is expected to enhance society's ability to predictively model turbulent combustion at elevated pressures. This is imperative due to the ever increasing combustion chamber pressures encountered in hydrocarbon combustion devices utilized in society (including diesel engines, gas turbines, rocket engines, and other potential hydrogen technologies). Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved. In addition, a multidisciplinary portion of the education plan involves bringing together the graduate students involved with this research with a group of computer engineers at UNC Charlotte. The DNS code will be shared and run on the UNCC parallel FPGA cluster. The purposes of this exercise are: knowledge sharing between two typically non-intersecting groups, and code optimization for both typical and advanced parallel architectures.

Madix at Harvard University for a research project that will develop the fundamental basis for simple, novel heterogeneously catalyzed reactions for the transformation of amides, imines, nitriles and aziridines over copper, silver and gold surfaces through understanding of the kinetics and mechanism of the surface reactions of nitrogen-containing molecules. The proposed studies are based on fundamental principles of surface reactivity discovered and developed in previous NSF-supported work. Amidization, iminization, nitrilation and aziridination reactions facilitated by these group IB metals will be studied utilizing well defined single crystal surfaces. This research will provide a molecularly based understanding of the elementary reaction steps of these complex synthesis reactions. They have the potential for transforming existing technologies into more energy efficient and environmentally benign processes.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Madix will perform research that will have a significant impact on important chemical transformations for the industrial sector with significant outcomes of improved catalyst selectivity, reduced waste, and potentially lower energy consumption. The proposed research is important to the development of processes critical to maintaining leadership in the multibillion dollar chemical industry in the United States and to the reduction in energy use. Broader impacts of the research has as an outcome the training and professional development of postdoctoral students and the training of both women and minority students. Professor Madix will include undergraduates in his research through the REU program at Harvard and will conduct coordinated activities with local high schools to stimulate the interest of minority high school students in physical science. Harvard University's existing partnerships with both The Engineering School at the Hyde Park Educational Complex in Boston and the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School will be utilized.

This award is also supported by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) program. The Harvard Forest Summer Research Program in Forest Ecology will enhance the ability of students to undertake interdisciplinary research and work with teams of researchers to collaborate on cutting edge projects. Teams of students and mentors will work to integrate empirical data with analytical and statistical models to investigate the impact of climatic changes on forest ecosystems. The research results will contribute to the development of practical forecasts of 21st century environmental change in New England and the eastern U.S. areas, and quantify the degree of uncertainty in these forecasts. Results are disseminated widely in senior theses, oral and poster presentations at regional, national, and international meetings, and in peer reviewed publications. In addition to their own research, students attend weekly research seminars and participate in workshops focusing on professional development including choosing and applying to graduate school, preparing scientific talks and papers, engaging in the discussion of the ethical conduct of research, and writing about science for general audiences. The program will actively recruit a diverse group of students from cultural and ethnic groups that are traditionally underrepresented in scientific careers. Applicants are selected based on an essay, letters of recommendation, and expressed interest in specific projects. There is no minimum GPA or prerequisite course requirement. An evaluation plan will assess participants' (1) acquisition and enhancement of scientific research skills; (2) satisfaction with the REU educational experience; and (3) post-program plans for education and scientific career development.

Kovac, California Institute of Technology<br/>ANT-0742592, PI: Clement L. Pryke, University of Chicago<br/>Collaborative Research: BICEP2 and SPUD - A Search for Inflation with Degree-Scale Polarimetry from the South Pole<br/><br/>The proposed work is a four-year program of research activities directed toward upgrading the BICEP (Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization) telescope operating at South Pole since early 2006 to reach far =stretching goals of detection of the Cosmic Gravitational-wave Background (CGB) . This telescope is a first Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) B-mode polarimeter, specifically designed to search for CGB signatures while mapping ~2% of the southern sky that is free of the Milky Way foreground galactic radiation at 100 GH and 150 GHz. The BICEP1 telescope will reach its designed sensitivity by the end of 2008. A coordinated series of upgrades to BICEP1 will provide the increased sensitivity and more exacting control of instrumental effects and potential confusion from galactic foregrounds necessary to search for the B-mode signal more deeply through space. A powerful new 150 GHz receiver, BICEP2, will replace the current detector at the beginning of 2009, increasing the mapping speed almost ten-fold. In 2010, the first of a series of compact, mechanically-cooled receivers (called SPUD - Small Polarimeter Upgrade for DASI) will be deployed on the existing DASI mount and tower, providing similar mapping speed at 100 GHz in parallel with BICEP2. The latter instrument will reach (and exceed with the addition of a SPUD polarimeter) the target sensitivity r = 0.15 set forth by the Interagency (NSF/NASA/DoE) Task Force on CMB Research for a future space mission dedicated to the detection and characterization of primordial gravitational waves. This Task Force has identified detection of the Inflation's gravitational waves as the number one priority for the modern cosmology. More broadly, as the cosmology captures a lot of the public imagination, it is a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in basic science. The CGB detection would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB radiation was to the Big Bang. The project will contribute to the training of the next generation of cosmologists by integrating graduate and undergraduate education with the technology and instrumentation development, astronomical observations and scientific analysis. Sharing of the forefront research results with public extends the new knowledge beyond the universities. This project will be undertaken in collaboration between the California Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago.<br/>

On certain walls in the moduli space of vacua, a BPS object can decay to less massive BPS objects. Such a wallcrossing phenomenon has an extremely rich and mysterious mathematical structure. It is proposed to study wall-crossings from various points of views including vacua with high number of supersymmetries, applying tools of mirror symmetry and string dualities.  Understanding the spectrum of BPS objects is important for calculating black hole entropy and topological string theory.  The PI proposes to uncover new geometrical invariants which are necessary for physically characterizing these string vacua, and explore the implications of a recently defined quasi-local mass which satisfies all known consistency conditions.  The projects address exciting questions that have important implications for theoretical physics, and for differential and algebraic geometry.  Central to the proposal is the training of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to conduct cutting edge cross-disciplinary research and to be effective in interacting with both the physics and mathematics communities.

In ant colonies, for example, individual ants cannot capture rich spatial information from their environment because of their limited sensing ability. Nevertheless, when the ants coordinate their activities within a colony, the group ends up exhibiting better sensing abilities. Using signal processing and communications techniques, the research studies how and why such manifestations of rational and organized behavior arise at the group level from local interactions among agents with limited abilities, what communication topologies enable such behavior, and what type of signal processing enables such formations.  <br/><br/>This research seeks to understand and reverse-engineer the distributed intelligence encountered in socio-economic-biological networks, by investigating relations with learning and rationality over cognitive networks. The latter are adaptive networks that avoid centralized information processing and perform in-network inference and control decisions. Cognitive networks contrast with networks that rely on centralized and parallel information fusion, which are not scalable, are hard to adapt to changing topologies, and suffer from points of vulnerability and information bottlenecks.  The research considers large scale networks of agents and studies how global (rational or irrational) patterns of behavior emerge, including herds, contagions and bubbles in economics. An understanding of how the biotic environment influences collective behavior in animal societies provides a real world guide to good cognitive networks, which can be used in turn to design engineered systems. Cognitive networks have applications in areas ranging from precision agriculture, to environmental monitoring, disaster relief management, and smart spaces.

In this collaborative effort involving the University of California at Davis and Harvard University, the PIs will focus on the design and implementation of parallel hash tables, one of the most fundamental of data structures, on the new platforms.  Real-time parallel hashing would enable a variety of graphics applications on dynamically changing data, including spatial hashing, surface and image matching, and hashed octrees which in turn enable a host of other applications including Boolean surface operations, point-cloud nearest neighbors, ray-tracing acceleration and photon mapping.  In prior work, the PIs built a baseline implementation that shows effective parallel hashing can be done on the GPU; they can construct the table as quickly as the fastest available radix sort, and can execute parallel random access on the elements much more quickly than binary search.  In the current research, the PIs plan to improve upon their baseline implementation significantly, while also focusing on related structures such as multi-maps and Bloom filters.  New designs and construction algorithms will be developed, implemented, and analyzed with respect to performance, and then applied to a variety of computer graphics applications. The PIs expect this work to lead to interesting theoretical results; modern hash table constructions have never been considered in the parallel context, so finding the right model for analysis is one goal of the research.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This project will contribute to the computing infrastructure, not only for computer graphics but also for general-purpose computation.  The PIs will distribute their implementations freely, in part by extending and building upon their existing (and popular) library of general-purpose data structures (the CUDA Data Parallel Primitives).  The PIs note that making the most of the  emerging parallel GPU resources requires training the next generation of programmers to think in parallel; therefore, they plan to exploit this project as an opportunity to revive a long-untaught undergraduate parallel programming course, in addition to studying parallel algorithms with their graduate students.

This project is centered on a research program to study Heavy Ion Collisions at European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) with the ALICE experiment in two areas of interest: the jet physics capabilities brought to ALICE by the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal), and a modest R&D component to explore the enhancement of the EMCaL physics possibilities by improving ALICE's track-by-track particle identification capabilities with the construction of a very high momentum charged particle identification detector (VHMPID), and the expansion of the number of the EMCaL modules.<br/><br/>Recruiting, retaining, and educating science, technology, engineering and mathematics students and teachers has been identified as the cornerstone in the effort to improve scientific literacy, maintain economic growth, and to provide the platform for relevant scientific discoveries.  This project addresses these issues by strengthening a recently instituted high-energy experimental nuclear physics program at CSU: (1) The use of cutting-edge technology for high-energy nuclear physics experiments provides an attractive opportunity to captivate and prepare students, (2) A collaborative program at an international laboratory exposes students to research experiences they could not otherwise obtain at an undergraduate university.  Because of the make-up of our student population, the location of our university and the current outreach programs of the department, this program has the potential to promote inner-city underrepresented students into STEM education.

It will use a global three-dimensional model (GEOS-Chem) driven by assimilated meteorological data and will include mechanistic representations of mercury speciation and transfer between the atmosphere and terrestrial and oceanic reservoirs. The model will improve on the existing version of GEOS-Chem, most notably through the incorporation of a detailed process-based terrestrial model. Although many processes are still uncertain, the work will develop a first capability to model how rapidly changes in anthropogenic mercury emissions are reflected by terrestrial inorganic mercury concentrations. The coupled land-atmosphere-ocean modeling framework will be evaluated and constrained using a large body of observational mercury data from the atmosphere (ships, aircraft, land sites), oceans (air-sea exchange, mercury speciation, correlations with environmental variables), and soils.<br/><br/>This research will provide a platform for future work examining (1) the potentially large impacts of climate change on the global mercury cycle, (2) the link between the global cycle of mercury and that of methylmercury, which is the bioavailable species that accumulates in food-webs. This will lead to a unique resource for the development of national and international policies targeted at reducing environmental mercury levels through control of anthropogenic emissions. The multiphase, three-dimensional modeling framework will have application to future modeling of other contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants. The project will train a graduate student in interdisciplinary environmental modeling.

This radiative approach is operationally specific to marine coccolithophores (Haptophyceae) and sensitive enough to quantify PIC concentrations in oligotrophic gyres. Global images of suspended PIC taken over the seven years of the MODIS Aqua mission show a 'Great Belt' of PIC near the sub-Antarctic front of the Southern Ocean that circles the globe. This feature occurs every year during austral summer and appears to be within the high-nutrient, low chlorophyll region of the Southern Ocean. The area of the Great Belt is ~88 million km2, 26% of the global ocean. Evidence from several cruises into the Great Belt region of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific sectors has verified elevated concentrations of coccolithophores; previous work in the Atlantic sector verified high optical scattering from PIC. The few ship observations we have are entirely consistent with the satellite views. In this project, the investigators will systematically study the coccolithophores of the Great Belt guided by the following science goals: (a) identify the coccolithophore species within this belt; (b) measure the abundance of coccolithophores and associated PIC; (c) measure coccolithopore calcification rates; (d) elucidate factors that may limit coccolithophore latitudinal range (e.g. stratification, temperature, macronutrients, trace metals, grazing); (e) demonstrate whether the variability in PIC relates to shallow export flux; (f) define how variability in PIC production relates to the pCO2, total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon budgets; and (g) examine the impact of short-term ocean acidification on coccolithophore growth and calcite dissolution. <br/><br/>The research will involve cruises along the 50 S parallel to sample the Great Belt, during the austral summer. The investigators will use a combination of underway surface sampling (primarily optical and hydrographic) and vertical station profiles (using CTD/rosette and large volume submersible pumps) to address hypotheses related to the above goals. The cruise track will elucidate both zonal and meridional variability in the Great Belt. Controlled carboy incubation experiments will examine the impact of ocean acidification at various future scenarios on coccolithophore growth and dissolution. Dilution experiments will address grazing-related mortality and dissolution questions. Controlled metal-addition incubations will focus on potential iron, zinc and cobalt limitation of the coccolithophores or competition from diatoms related to silica availability. The proposed field observations and metal-addition experiments will provide important information on the current status of the Great Belt in the context of global biogeochemistry. The ocean acidification experiments to be undertaken are more forward-looking in terms of the fate of the Southern Ocean coccolithophores in a future acidified ocean.  <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The globally significant size of the Great Belt indicates that it likely plays a major role in global biogeochemistry and climate change feedbacks. Thus, the investigators expect this work to have broad, transformative impacts in biological and chemical oceanography. Ocean acidification from the burning of fossil fuels is predicted to lower the pH of the surface ocean by 0.3 units in the next century and up to 0.7 units - a 5-fold increase in the proton concentration by the year 2300. A major goal of this study is to examine the effects of ocean acidification on coccolithophores in a region of low calcite saturation (i.e., one of the first regions expected to become sub-saturating for calcite). The results of these experiments will therefore be highly relevant to our basic understanding of the marine carbon cycle. Related to career development and Criterion II activities, the project includes field experience on two cruises for NSF REU undergraduates from Maine universities or colleges, providing funds for them to attend a scientific meeting. Participation of undergraduate students from Maine colleges builds capacity in our rural coastal state and helps thwart the serious issue of 'brain drain', in which the best students are leaving Maine to seek opportunity in wealthier, more populated states. A teacher will also participate on the cruises (via the NSF-sponsored ARMADA program). This teacher will develop learning modules for students about such topics as coccolithophores, calcification, export production, metal-plankton interactions, ocean acidification and climate change.

If self-control problems influence behavior, they could have particularly important implications for the workplace by dampening worker productivity and leading individuals to earn less than they would like.  In addition, they are likely to influence the optimal design of employment incentive contracts and how firms organize production (O'Donoghue and Rabin 2006; Clark 1994).<br/><br/>However, there is extremely scant empirical evidence on whether self-control problems actually matter for explaining worker behavior.  This project fills this gap by undertaking the first field experiment testing for such problems in a workplace setting.  In doing so, the project seeks to make an important contribution to the economics literature on self-control problems and to the incipient literature on the implications of self-control problems for workplace design.<br/><br/>Research Design: In economics, the self-control problem is often conceptualized as time inconsistency in preferences (Thaler and Shefrin, 1981; Laibson, 1997).  If workers have self-control problems and are sophisticated about these problems, then time-inconsistency models offer four clear predictions: (i) workers will want to use commitment devices to get themselves to work hard in the future; (ii) their demand for commitment will be higher farther in advance of the work period; (iii) the availability of commitment devices will lead to increased effort; and (iv) their self-control problem will be less severe when earnings are paid in the same period as when work is performed.<br/><br/>This project will use this set of predictions to test for self-control problems in a field experiment on full-time data entry employees.  Workers will be offered a choice between two incentive contracts.  The first contract will pay a piece-rate wage of w for each unit of production.  The commitment contract will let workers choose a target level for themselves, and pay them w for each unit of production if they meet their target and only pay w/2 if they fall short of it.  Although a worker can never earn more under the commitment contract and may end up earning much less, workers with self-control problems may choose the commitment contract to bind themselves to work harder in the future.  The experiment treatments will vary the timing of when the commitment contract is offered (the evening before the workday versus the morning of the workday), as well as when wages are paid.  Outcomes on worker choice and production will be used to test the set of key predictions.  If all four predictions hold, this will provide clear evidence that workers face self-control problems, and that workplace arrangements can increase worker effort and earnings by mitigating the self-control problem. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The optimal design of workplace arrangements changes significantly if workers have time-inconsistent preferences.  Consequently, if the project demonstrates large quantitative effects of self-control problems, this would have important implications for how firms should incentivize their workers.  It would also have ramifications for the design of government policies, such as job training programs that seek to reduce unemployment.  In addition, these results would have implications for understanding labor markets?especially in developing countries where work arrangements are varied and include sharecropping, intermittent labor contracting, formal employment, and self-employment.  Considering these arrangements through a self-control lens could deliver drastically new insights on labor market institutions, and on how the workplace can be structured to increase worker welfare.

These tools will be used to evaluate prior knowledge of students entering biochemistry and molecular biology classes from various backgrounds. A central web-based resource for biochemistry and molecular biology educators will be created featuring these assessment tools to help facilitate educational approaches focused on foundational concepts, discipline specific knowledge, and essential research skills, all of which are necessary to prepare students to take on the challenges of the 21st century. Support will be provided for pedagogical approaches based on validated assessments of outcomes. The network has four specific aims: 1) Identification of foundational concepts in terms of core knowledge and foundational principles, research and skills, 2) Creation of a taxonomy of foundational concepts and skills, linked to topics outlined in the undergraduate curriculum recommendations of ASBMB, 3) Development and evaluation of appropriate assessment tools, and 4) Creation of a toolkit that can be easily accessed by the academic community.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project will include bringing faculty from community colleges, primarily undergraduate institutions, research institutions that serve diverse populations of students and institutions serving under-represented minorities together to form teams that will address specific assessment issues. The first large working group, which will include a wide range of experts in content, concept development, pedagogy, and assessment, will meet to define the framework and needs of the concept assessment network. A smaller working group will meet each year to continue development assessment resources. Undergraduate Affiliated Network (UAN) groups from six regions in the country will meet to both contribute to the development of assessment resources and provide feedback to inform the smaller working group. <br/><br/>This project is supported jointly by the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Division of Undergraduate Education.

Swanson<br/>IOS-1020325<br/>RUI: Defining the genetic architecture underlying nonrandom mating in Arabidopsis thaliana<br/><br/>It is well known that flowering plants are not reproductively indiscriminate. The pollen dusted across flower stigmas is a mixture, whose proportions do not often match proportions within progeny.  In other words, some pollen have greater mating success, a phenomenon called nonrandom mating. Nonrandom mating has striking evolutionary significance in organisms across kingdoms. The genetics of nonrandom mating in flowering plants, however, is less well understood. This project will exploit tools available for the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to define the genetic elements that direct nonrandom mating.  A fuller understanding of the genetics of plant fertilization is required to facilitate the manipulation of fertilization in agriculture. Finally, the approach proposed in this project requires the training of undergraduates at a primary undergraduate institution; this work will enhance the institution's research and teaching infrastructures, and provide undergraduate students with research training using cutting-edge technology.  Such work has great potential to expose and recruit students to research professions.
0955124	CAREER: Electromicrobiological Studies Using Microbial Electrochemical Systems Capable of Sustainable Energy Production and Waste Treatment	CBET	ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABILITY	07/01/2010	06/17/2010	Hong Liu	OR	Oregon State University	Standard Grant	Carole Read	06/30/2016	$400,000.00		liuh@engr.orst.edu	OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY	Corvallis	OR	973318507	5417374933	ENG	7644	002E, 046E, 1045, 1187, 9102	$0.00	0955124<br/>Liu<br/><br/>The conversion of biomass, especially organic wastes, to energy is considered an essential part of a sustainable global energy portfolio. Novel microbial electrochemical systems, such as microbial fuel cell for electricity generation and microbial electrolysis cell for hydrogen production, have emerged as potential clean technologies for renewable energy production and waste treatment. The key feature and common process shared by these systems is the microbe-catalyzed electron transfer from organic matter to anodes. Enhancing current output from the anode is critical for the successful application of all these processes, which requires a fundamental understanding of the biofilm that develops on the anode. <br/>The applicants aim, through this project, is to advance the emerging area of electromicrobiological engineering by systematically investigating the high current-producing biofilm of a microbial electrochemical system capable of sustainable energy production and waste treatment. This project will build on the recent studies of a mixed bacterial culture in the applicant?s lab that exhibits many of the desirable features for electricity and hydrogen production. The microbial community is simple enough, however, to remain manageable for analysis of complex interactions between the constituent species, thereby providing an ideal case study for investigation of a current-producing anodic community. The main activities of the proposed research program include: (1) isolation and identification of the dominant bacterial strains in the microbial consortium; (2) characterization of the isolated strains in terms of their morphological, physiological, and electrochemical properties; (3) elucidation of the electron transfer mechanisms of the isolated exoelectrogens; and (4) investigation of the interactive relationships between different bacterial species in the anodic consortium. <br/><br/>This is the first systematic investigation of its kind, wherein a mixed culture with high current-generating capability is studied comprehensively to determine the identities of the predominant bacteria, the mechanisms by which the bacteria transfer electrons to the electrode, and the ways in which the bacteria interact in the community. The proposed research, when successfully accomplished, not only will address the unanswered question of why the current generated by mixed cultures is often much greater and more stable than that generated by most pure cultures, but also will result in the discovery of highly efficient new model species for electromicrobiological studies. Furthermore, the conclusions from this research will enrich our understanding of two critical and poorly-understood aspects of microbial electrochemical systems: the mechanisms of extracellular electron transfer, including biogenic mediators, outer membrane cytochromes, and bacterial nanowires and the metabolic interactions within anodic consortia, involving quorum sensing chemicals, mediators, and exchange of electron donors between species. Understanding the fundamental metabolic and electrochemical mechanisms within the anode biofilm not only will enable the design of stable and efficient systems for energy generation, but also will accelerate the development of microbial electrochemical systems for diverse other applications such as bioremediation and biosensing. The applicant has a solid track record of performance and publication in this research field, and has the resources for executing the proposed program successfully. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are educational, environmental, and economic, and range from local to global in scale. The microbial electrochemical systems that relate to both energy and environmental sustainability can serve as a powerful platform for motivating students to study and understand complex concepts of microbial ecology, electrochemistry, and material science and engineering and resolve energy and environmental issues in the future. This project will significantly improve the scientific reasoning skills of graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students through the development of hands-on microbial fuel cell teaching modules. This project also presents a unique opportunity for blending the educational experience of the local students involved in the project with cutting edge scientific research in an area of national and global concern. Efforts will be made to recruit and mentor underrepresented minority students through OSUs SESEY program. The concomitant treatment of waste during the energy generation process performs a double-duty of sustainability, providing energy from a renewable source while benefiting human health worldwide. Finally, generating energy from agricultural and industrial waste biomass offers a novel source of economic benefit to farmers and industries, especially those in remote areas and in developing countries. The results of this work will be disseminated through publications in refereed journals and conference presentations and also will be made available on the applicants webpage.

Civilians are increasingly the victims of new and contemporary wars.  While repressive forms of crime against civilians prevailed in the Iraq regime of Saddam Hussein, economic crimes against civilians became more common during the post-invasion Coalition occupation.  The crimes of the past Iraq regime set a foundation of sectarian fear and conflict that was released by the US-led invasion and which, in turn, led to rampant crimes against civilians and their property.  The research will assess this sequence with three surveys that include more than 9,000 personal interviews conducted before and after the regime change in Iraq. We will assess whether a sequence unfolded in which ethno-sectarian strong state repression and deprivation was followed in Iraq by a weak state in which fears about safety, protection, and resource needs in turn caused extensive sectarian looting and violent crime by gangs and militias. We will more specifically examine whether the wave of violent crimes that peaked in 2005-6 also elevated ethno-sectarian crimes against property to peak levels. The interview accounts will be used to elaborate and illustrate statistical findings. There is little past analysis of property losses during the occupation of Iraq.  Yet the loss of household and business wealth is assumed to be extensive, especially for Iraq?s more than four million displaced persons.  Previous work predicts that breakdown in state control over crime and violence is most extensive in mixed community settings.  This is likely because conflict increases as contesting groups come into close residential contact or in other ways.  The research will test such predictions in the post-invasion neighborhoods of Baghdad.  We predict that the lower the proportion of the largest ethnic group in a post-invasion neighborhood, and therefore the greater the ethno-sectarian mix, the higher the level of property and person crime. We further predict that a redistribution of wealth in Iraq first began to emerge during a preliminary looting stage (2003-5), then peaked with the rise of violent crimes against persons in a second stage (2005-6), and finally declined in its volume but not in its re-distributional consequences in the third period of the Surge (2007). The combination of data sets available for this research allows a unique case study of the sectarian and economic consequences of violent crime in a transition from a strong to weak state.  This is a kind of transition that may be increasingly replacing older forms of military conflict. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Contemporary wars may be less consequential for military targets than they are for the health and socio-economic well-being of civilian victims.  These losses and transfers of wealth can be especially devastating for some while presenting enormous opportunities for others.  It is important in developing our understanding to document and explain ethno-sectarian aspects of the redistribution of wealth in settings such as Iraq. This understanding is essential to explaining how these conflicts disrupt and destroy opportunities for growth and development where it often is needed most.  Traditional militaristic approaches to the understanding of war in a changing world of international development and destruction are often outdated.  The primary goal of this case study in Iraq is to increase our understanding of the socio-economic consequences of crimes against civilians and their property, elements that increasingly characterize modern day warfare.<br/>

Due to their large scale deployment, these systems pose very different requirements, compared with traditional real-time systems. They generally require soft (predictable) real-time delivery over multiple domains on dynamic networks. These requirements cannot be met using current overprovision or reservation-based solutions. This project investigates a promising solution to effectively address this issue across multiple domains. <br/>The fundamental issues in supporting large-scale predictable real-time delivery on the Internet, by addressing the predictability in the network layer are studies here. In particular, the project explores the ready-available time synchronization technology, such as GPS, CDMA, and IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol, to achieve predictable delivery over multiple domains and dynamic paths. Two key mechanisms are developed to estimate the delay from a router to a destination and service a packet based on its upstream earliness and downstream laxness for more efficient resource sharing among partially-overlapping flows.<br/>The results from this project will provide a viable practical solution to support large-scale distribution control systems and enable more powerful applications in power control, traffic monitoring, and energy management. The research results will be shared with the broad community via journal and conference publications. A prototype system will be built to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. This project will work with Native Hawaiian Science and Engineering Mentorship Program to broaden the participation of minority students.

The research mission of the Center is to perform leading-edge research that is industry driven to produce technologically small satellites and components, which will be on-orbit validated and demonstrated. <br/><br/>The USF research site plans to focus on small satellite technology, expanding the research capability of the current center. Research needs have been defined in collaboration with potential partners representing a range of industries. The research team will emphasize system, subsystem and component level research. A strong multi-disciplinary team of researchers is included, representing mechanical and electrical engineering. Institutional facilities, organized in a number of research centers, are available to support the research described. The collaboration between USF and ASTREC will help advance the state-of-the-art techniques in small satellites as well as enhance the space related academic curriculum using realistic satellite projects. The research interests and experience of the USF team both augment and complement very well the research activities and competencies already represented at the center. <br/><br/>The technologies planned to be developed for small satellites, such as the compact, multifunctional RF devices, would have applicability in emerging commercial and military applications such as biomedical sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles, and could represent transformational technologies in low-power wireless communication. The inclusion of USF in the center would provide access to a highly diverse student body, which would add diversity to the overall center. A variety of NSF and institutional sponsored programs would be leveraged to support Hispanic and African American student involvement in the I/UCRC. Through the Alfred P. Sloan program, USF has 30 minority candidates in the Ph.D. pipeline.  FSU has a long-standing, successful diversity program, which will support the planned efforts of recruiting and out-reach to under-represented groups. Specifically, the proposal includes highly commendable plans for involving students in prominent roles at the planning meetings. The proposing team also has a long-standing, highly successful collaboration with the Tampa Museum of Science and Industry that will be utilized in the proposed research site to reach out to K-12 as well as the general public.

The research thrusts are: 1) fusion of complementary algorithms and 2) optimal sensor distributions for the fused set. Selection of complementary algorithms involves identification of methods whose sensitivity to damage and to the sources that cloud damage detection differs with damage scenarios and operating conditions. In a first phase the project inspects the fusion of detection filters that operate on residual correlations with filters that work with amplitude dependent residual metrics. The research expects to demonstrate that the optimized fused detector will have a damage detection threshold that, for a fixed probability of false alarm, is significantly better than that of the individual algorithms. Intimately connected with the algorithmic fusion is research on the selection of sensor layouts that are optimal, given the fused interrogation scheme. Following the analytical work the research progresses into an experimental phase where the performance of the fused algorithms is tested on a one quarter scale steel structure that is exposed to the weather and thus subjected to realistic environmental changes.<br/><br/>Algorithm fusion has proven fruitful in Automatic Target Recognition and various other areas but a systematic examination in the context of Structural Health Monitoring is first carried out in this project. If successful, this research will not only offer a robust damage detection scheme for applications to civil structures but it will also point to the merit of algorithmic fusion for other objectives such as the localization and the quantification of damage. Educational activities connected with the project include: 1) interactions with Olin College, an undergraduate engineering school of excellence, through introduction of multi-week research activities based on topics from the project 2) involvement with the program Girls Get Connected (GGC), a science and technology outreach for middle school girls in the Boston area and 3) an afternoon of hands-on activities on the Harvard?s Medical School explorations program, which is attended each fall by over 200 middle school students from Cambridge and Boston. The graduate student working on the project will also receive advanced training on the topic of damage detection in civil structures which is of high engineering importance.

GLADE is intended to serve as a nesting ground for the US Geodynamics community to present and discuss both state-of-the-art and emerging research directions.<br/><br/>With the view that computational geodynamics has moved into the realm of predictive capability, this highly technical discipline needs a venue for in-depth and specialized discussion in order that we may learn from each other. However, the geodynamics community also recognizes the essential role that observations have in developing and constraining geodynamic models, in particular those coming from areas such as tectonics, plate reconstructions, and rheology of Earth materials. Towards this goal, the meeting strongly encourages participation from the tectonics community and aims to foster meaningful and continual engagement between the geodynamics and tectonics communities.<br/><br/>The content of the GLADE meeting will be focused upon ma jor outstanding scientific issues that transcend solid Earth geodynamics and related topics in planetary evolution and dynamics. The scientific content is spread over the first three days of the meeting, while the final day will be set aside for tutorials and technical workshops on geodynamics software. These demonstrations and tutorials are intended to emphasize next-generation geodynamics software and community-supported advances to existing software, much of which has been championed and maintained by the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG). All graduate students in attendance will be required to participate in the technical program, but other (senior) participants may leave after the scientific program. The meeting adopts a novel format that seeks to better integrate poster, oral, and discussion sessions, as well as designate time for students to meet with keynote speakers. In addition, the CIG steering committee will host a townhall discussion on the first evening of the meeting in order to gain input from the community regarding past and future software development priorities.<br/><br/>This effort is supported by the Geophysics, Tectonics, and Marine Geology & Geophysics Programs.

A comparative study of contemporaneous intraplate oceanic and continental alkaline volcanism will be used to evaluate sources and processes responsible for magma production and differentiation. The seamount lavas will provide an opportunity to better characterize the composition of their underlying mantle source whereas the continental lavas will provide information on any effects of contamination by continental crust on their source signatures. The cause of Cenozoic magmatism in West Antarctica has been explained by a variety of models based primarily on geochemical evidence from continental volcanism. The proposed investigation will for the first time provide detailed geochronologic and geochemical data for both continental lavas and adjacent oceanic seamount lavas, thus offering a means by which to critically assess whether Cenozoic alkaline volcanism is due to plume or plume-related activities or magmatism unrelated to mantle plumes. The classic element of this controversy is whether the geochemistry of the magmas represents melting of mantle asthenosphere or subcontinental lithosphere and whether there is a degree of contamination as they rise through relatively thick and chemically heterogeneous continental crust. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>This project will support a PhD and MSc student. Undergraduate students will also be involved in sample preparation, analytical work and interpretation via honors/senior theses. A post-doctoral associate will be involved in the oxygen isotopic analysis of the samples. The students will be involved in a multi-institutional and international collaboration. The geochemical database generated will be made available to other researchers in the region and the results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

In particular, we continue to study the complex valued refinement of the Ray-Singer torsion introduced in our joint paper with T. Kappeler using the graded determinant of the odd signature operator. This leads  to new properties of both the Ray-Singer torsion and the eta-invariant. We suggest a refined version of the Bismut-Lott higher analytic torsion which contains more information and is easier to study than the original higher torsion. It also provides a link between the higher analytic torsion and the higher eta-invatriant of Bismut and Cheeger. We suggest a version of the refined analytic torsion for complex Calabi-Yau manifolds. This leads to a multi-dimensional generalization of the Dedekind eta-function. We also consider a new regularization procedure for definition of the trace and the determinant of certain class of pseudo-differential operators on odd-dimensional manifolds. This procedure allows to avoid many anomalies coursed by usual zeta-function regularization. It also turns out to be the most adequate for description of non-linear sigma-models of superconductivity. In a joint project with A. Abanov we suggest to use this regularization to compute  the Berry phase in some of these models. <br/><br/>We use different extension of the notion of determinant and trace from finite matrices to differential operators in oder to construct new mathematical objects. This leads to new invariants of manifolds as well as to the new information about the old invariant. When applied to certain  complex manifolds it gives a generalization of a classical Dedekind eta-function and new applications to number theory. We apply a new construction of a determinant to obtain a new description of some models of superconductivity. This new description allows to compute so called Berry phase in many examples.

The coupling of bacteria with the primary producers therefore has implications for climate and ecosystem models. Since bacteria interact with organic matter, including phytoplankton cells, at the nanometer to micrometer scale, understanding the biogeochemical coupling of bacteria with primary producers requires knowledge of the nature and strength of interactions at the micrometer scale. Using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) the PI recently discovered that a substantial fraction of heterotrophic (non-photosynthetic) bacteria, including the natural assemblages of Synechococcus, previously considered free-living, appeared conjoint with other bacteria. In a preliminary experiment, pelagic bacteria also became associated with cultures of Prochlorococcus (we do not yet know whether natural assemblages of Prochlorococcus harbor conjoint bacteria). In view of the biogeochemical importance of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus as major primary producers in the ocean, their symbioses with heterotrophic bacteria could have far-reaching consequences.<br/><br/>This EAGER study has the potential to change ideas on microbial carbon cycling and marine ecosystems functioning. It may reveal a novel microspatial context, e.g., carbon and nutrient cycling 'hot spots', particularly in oligotrophic waters where Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are major primary producers. This potentially transformative, but high risk research, is an excellent fit to the EAGER model for funding. Cutting edge methodologies, including cryo-electron tomography, nanoSIMS and single cell phylogenetics will be used through multidisciplinary collaborations to test hypotheses on the ultrastructure and ecosystem function of the symbioses. The phylogenetic identity of the conjoint partners will be determined by direct micromanipulation of seawater samples to pick individual conjoint cells followed by analysis by MDA (Multiple Displacement Amplification). NanoSIMS analysis of intercellular elemental exchanges will characterize the nature and biogeochemical significance of the symbioses. Field studies will examine the distribution of the symbioses in relation to relevant environmental factors. Success in the goals detailed by the PI should yield mechanistic understanding and biogeochemical significance of the symbioses. We will rapidly communicate our findings in a wide circulation journal as well as through talks at appropriate conferences.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research project is aimed at gaining insights on fundamental mechanisms underlying the roles of microbes in the functioning of marine ecosystems, biological carbon cycling and the ocean's role in global climate variability. Therefore, the result should also be relevant to pressing societal issues fisheries and climate change. The PI's lab is actively involved in public education from local to international levels, and the findings of the proposed research will be disseminated broadly to the public in appropriately accessible formats. One postdoctoral fellow and one graduate student will receive training during this research.

The proposal is to deploy a Spray glider equipped with a CTD, CDOM fluorometer, and ADP in an effort to observe subsurface oil and general oceanographic conditions. The combination of CDOM fluorometer measurements and acoustic backscatter intensity will be used to sense oil in water. Work will be in collaboration with Breck Owens of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who will take an important role in glider piloting. The glider will be deployed from Cocodrie, Louisiana aboard the vessel Acadiana during the first week of June. The glider will be sent south of the spill site, and away from surface slicks, with the goal of observing the offshore extent of subsurface oil. The data will be widely disseminated in real time for the purpose of establishing oceanic conditions and initializing predictive models.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: As the oil spill is of extreme societal importance, this work proposed here has potentially huge broader impacts. Public interest in the oil spill is extremely high, with intense media coverage. A successful demonstration of the observation of subsurface oil will influence the response to oil spills for years. The collaboration of ocean scientists to address this problem of national scope may prove to be a model for the future. The data generated by gliders may lead to improved prediction of ocean currents in the region, which is essential for knowing how the oil will disperse. This use of gliders is an excellent example of their utility as a tool for rapid response.

0962721	Bacterial Interactions Underlying Coral Disease Resistance	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	06/15/2010	04/15/2011	Farooq Azam	CA	University of California-San Diego Scripps Inst of Oceanography	Continuing grant	David L. Garrison	05/31/2014	$603,638.00		fazam@ucsd.edu	8602 La Jolla Shores Dr	LA JOLLA	CA	920930210	8585341293	GEO	1650	9169, EGCH	$0.00	Intellectual Merit: An ever-growing variety of diseases, including some demonstrably caused by bacteria, are decimating reef-building corals in many places around the globe. Corals are open systems persistently exposed to a great diversity of exogenous bacteria in the overlying seawater and attached to sinking particles. Furthermore, as coastal development continues to expand, increasing eutrophication, there is increasing concern that endogenous bacteria among the normal coral associated community could proliferate to become opportunistic pathogens causing tissue damage and coral death. How corals resist bacterial invasions is a complex issue, one critical aspect being the ability of endogenous bacteria to resist colonization and proliferation of potential pathogens. <br/><br/>Despite great strides in recent years uncovering the remarkable genetic diversity of coral-associated bacteria, mitigation and management of coral diseases remains hampered by a lack of understanding of in situ ecological interactions within the microbial community and with exogenous bacteria that underlie coral health and disease. Bacterial attachment and proliferation are critical steps in the infection process, thus inhibiting or preventing colonization and proliferation of pathogens is fundamental to disease resistance.  <br/><br/>Recent research by the investigator demonstrates that corals exposed to organic matter enrichment can become colonized by potential pathogens, but the communities can rebound from such perturbations. Conducting in vitro studies, the investigator found that bacteria-bacteria antagonism is common among coral isolates which suggests it may be a mechanism to resist community shifts and pathogen colonization. It could thus drive resilience within coral-associated microbial communities.  In this project the investigator will test these interactions in an in situ context.  <br/><br/>Microbes are critical for the functioning of coral ecosystems at the global scale and, therefore, it is essential that a mechanistic understanding of microbial interactions at the microscale be attained.  The following hypotheses will be tested which are designed to elucidate the ecological mechanisms by which bacterial colonization and proliferation in the coral mucus layer (CML) are prevented by microbial interactions:  1) Bacterial community homeostasis in the CML is maintained through the exclusion of potential colonizers 2) Microspatial organic matter hotspots within the coral mucus layer, particularly surrounding zooxanthallae, create loci of intense growth and antagonism 3) Spatially dispersed organic matter inputs overwhelm microscale hotspots and enable pathogens to colonize the CML <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project simultaneously improves our fundamental understanding of coral associated microbial ecology and provides a necessary scientific basis for marine resource management decisions. Public education, at both the local and international levels, is a key component of the routine activities of all participating researchers, and these activities will prosper from inclusion of cutting-edge ecological findings generated by this research. Additionally, three postdoctoral researchers (two full time and one at two months per year) and one graduate student will receive training from the integrated research and education activities supported through this renewal.

Bamzai	05/31/2013	$300,000.00		vramanathan@ucsd.edu	8602 La Jolla Shores Dr	LA JOLLA	CA	920930210	8585341293	GEO	1524, 5740	0000, 4444, 7916, OTHR	$0.00	Project Surya is a scientific experiment aimed at quantifying the radiative forcing due to black carbon (BC) from biomass-fueled cooking and heating fires. Roughly 2.5 billion people depend on biomass burning for cooking and heating which contributes about 25% of the global BC emissions. Absorption of solar radiation by BC is estimated to contribute as much as 20% to 55% of the CO2 to global warming. <br/><br/>The study will encompass a detailed analysis of the results of efforts to reduce BC emissions from 350 rural households in the densely populated Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) region of Northern India. The reductions would be achieved by replacing traditional village cooking stoves with poor combustion efficiencies to modern stoves with higher efficiencies. The fundamental goal of the year-long study will be to collect and analyze observational data to test whether the effects of conversion to clean cooking on radiative forcing are discernable, and whether the net result warms or cools.  The change in net radiative forcing will warm if the reduction in reflecting aerosol is greater than the reduction in absorbing aerosol, and vise versa.  The hypothesis is that the net reduction will result in cooling. This is what will be tested in this proof-of-concept study.  The principal investigator (PI) estimates a ratio significantly greater than one, of reduced absorbing aerosol to reflecting aerosol, which means that a massive conversion to clean cooking would have a significant negative feedback (cooling) to CO2-forced warming.  His estimate must be tested with observations.  This EAGER award will enable that test.  If he is right, the science and applications will be transformative.  The project is  risky for several reasons, among them are the robustness of the measurement of the ratio, the difficulties of upscaling information to much larger, more heterogeneous regions in India, and the new IT data collection techniques developed for working in an environment like an Indian village.  If successful, the payoff could be globally significant.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Project Surya could lead to the rapid reduction of warming aerosol and gases. With indoor pollution killing over a million people a year, global action to cut soot emissions could be of major and immediate benefit for both public health and the climate.

One of the most challenging tasks in modern biology is the interpretation of the massive amounts of data becoming available through recent genomics, proteomics and related advances. Proteins are the cell's worker molecules, so there is a tremendous interest to understand how they behave, relate to each other, and how they regulate physiological processes. At the core of the toolbox is a fast and scalable substructure matching method that finds correspondences of a three-dimensional set of atoms (a motif) to a set of protein structures. The goal is to provide biologists with a versatile 'Swiss army knife' for probing the relationship between protein structure and function. The toolbox will be built in a way that it will automatically draw metadata information from relevant online databases in order to be continuously up-to-date. The output will not only report and visualize the results but link to online sources for further evaluation and analysis. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project will strengthen biological infrastructure by providing a versatile computational toolbox for the analysis of protein structure and function. The toolbox will be widely disseminated (1) as a web service, (2) as a downloadable package with a command line and Python module interface, and (3) as a plug-in for Chimera, a popular, free molecular modeling program. Besides working with their collaborators, the PIs will reach out to interest groups and related conferences for building a community of users for the proposed tool and encourage the contribution of novel workflows by the scientific community.   Students involved in the project will be trained as part of a highly interdisciplinary team, and educational and research activities (through CRA-W, the Computer Research Association's Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research) for undergraduate students are planned.

Plinian eruptions are of very high explosive intensity and destructiveness. They can last for days with individual Plinian phases lasting for hours and producing tens of kilometers tall, sustained columns of hot gases and volcanic particles. These volcanic plumes can become dispersed on a hemispherical or global scale with significant societal impact. Key mechanisms to producing a Plinian eruption are the 'explosive' release of magmatic volatiles, such as water, carbon dioxide and sulfur, in conjunction with the 'explosive' fragmentation of the erupting magma into pyroclasts. The latter are variably sized particles of quenched magma, including volcanic ash. The interrelation between this explosive release of magmatic volatiles and magma fragmentation to result in a Plinian eruption is the focus of this project.<br/><br/>This project will involve the numerical modeling of vesicle size distributions measured in pycroclasts from the 1912 Novarupta eruption. Vesicle size distributions provide a direct record of magma ascent conditions that can be investigated through modeling of bubble nucleation and growth in the ascending magma, both a consequence of volatile exsolution from the magma during ascent-driven decompression. The time-pressure history of an ascending parcel of magma, from which a given pyroclast is derived, is the key parameter determining the fit of modeled to observed vesicle size distributions. This investigation will test the hypothesis that decompression rates are surprisingly large during Plinian eruptions, as well as the question of how bubble nucleation and magma fragmentation are related. The large decompression rates apparently required to nucleate the large numbers of bubbles preserved as vesicles in pyroclasts can only be sustained for very short times, presumably immediately prior to or perhaps during magma fragmentation. It is thought that fragmentation is the consequence of accumulated bubble overpressure in excess of the magma's tensile strength. This project will integrate existing observational analyses of eruptive products with theoretical and empirical work on bubble nucleation and magma fragmentation through a comprehensive quantitative analysis. The resultant reconstruction of magma decompression, bubble nucleation, bubble growth and ultimately magma fragmentation, as recorded by the well-documented 1912 Novarupta pyroclast samples, is expected to lead to new advances in our understanding of explosive volcanism in general and Plinian style volcanic eruptions in particular.
1024412	Doctoral Dissertation Research in Political Science: Descriptive Representatives and Institutional Context	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	08/01/2010	06/24/2010	Lanny Martin	TX	William Marsh Rice University	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	07/31/2011	$12,000.00	Jason Eichorst	lanm12000@gmail.com	6100 MAIN ST	Houston	TX	770051827	7133484820	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	Does better descriptive representation of traditionally underrepresented groups lead to better substantive representation of their interests in policy-making? In other words, do individuals elected to represent a group that has been previously underrepresented (e.g., the indigenous in Bolivia) demonstrate distinctly different policy views than those representatives who have traditionally held power? Does the strength of the link between descriptive and substantive representation depend on the types of institutional mechanisms designed to enhance descriptive representation, the types of parties descriptive representatives belong to, or the strength of party control over their behavior?<br/><br/>This project will attempt to provide answers to these questions as they pertain to one important form of substantive representation: the expression of policy views of descriptive representatives in legislative deliberations. It examines the deliberative behavior of descriptive representatives both on more traditional issues commonly explored in political science literature (e.g., land rights for indigenous representatives in Latin America, or social welfare policy for black representatives in the U.S.) and a wide variety of political issues that are arguably more salient to the general public (e.g., foreign policy, tax policy, and healthcare policy). In doing so, it develops an original measure of substantive representation that maps patterns in speeches during committee debates to uncover whether representatives from underrepresented groups espouse significantly different policy views than representatives from historically represented groups. It will explain and show how the political context conditions legislator behavior and determines the extent to which we should see differences between descriptive and more traditional representatives.<br/><br/>Building on previous work, the researcher proposes a contextual theory of substantive representation that accounts for why political context should affect the behavior of descriptive representatives in particular, thereby mitigating the link between descriptive and substantive representation. The researcher tests the theoretical argument using a sample of Latin American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru) where there is cross-national and temporal variation across the three different political contexts (i.e., the extent of party control, the type of party, and the institutional mechanism used for increasing descriptive representation) and where the committee deliberations appear to serve the same purpose cross-nationally, which is 1) to set the terms of the policy debate and 2) to signal to constituents that legislators are working on their behalf. Field research for this project, which will be conducted in the legislative archives of each country, involves collecting and scanning committee debates as machine-readable documents, and the empirical analysis involves converting the text into data using automated content analysis to uncover patterns in speeches across representatives.<br/><br/>This project makes a substantial contribution by demonstrating whether or not changing the 'face' of the legislature has a significant impact on policy-making. It will uncover if electing members from a historically underrepresented group has an impact on how that group is represented, and if these newly elected descriptive representatives are doing anything different than traditional representatives. More importantly, the project will explore how the political context affects legislator behavior and mitigates the relationship between descriptive and substantive representation. This has a profound impact on understanding just how government can influence everyday life and the effects it has on democratic stability.

Why does conflict break out between groups in some communities but not in others? Such questions are investigated through a study of communal conflicts in Ethiopia, a poor country where local order often breaks down as neighboring groups take up arms to resolve their disputes. By examining patterns of conflict at the district level, this research project aims to explain how institutions of local governance influence tensions produced by social divides and resource scarcity. Specifically, this study examines to what extent the outbreak of violence depends on the representation of different groups in district-level administration and the intensity of weather-related shocks to local crop production or animal rearing.<br/><br/>Ethiopia provides an ideal context for studying how communal conflicts arise through the interaction between institutions, identities, and resources. While the country's districts vary considerably in levels of ethnic diversity and land productivity, decentralizing reforms adopted in the past 15 years have empowered all districts to make decisions over budget expenditures, land use, and agricultural inputs. The distribution of district resources may not affect the welfare of citizens during normal times, but a district's authority over land and water use becomes a critical issue during the prolonged periods of scarcity often confronted in a country that depends on rain-fed agriculture. Whether local groups monopolize or share control of district administration could therefore influence the outbreak of violence between them.<br/><br/>To assess the causes of communal conflict in Ethiopia, this project will develop a dataset of conflicts found in all districts and undertake ethnographic studies of two selected districts over a two-year period. First, the project will draw on government and non-government sources of information to assemble a dataset of local conflicts across Ethiopia's 550 districts between 1995 and 2006. The district-level data will allow for a statistical analysis that tests whether the outbreak of violence can be attributed to institutional, demographic, or economic factors. Second, the project will use the district-level dataset to identify two districts for in-depth ethnographic study. Interviews and focus groups will be organized with members of selected communities to establish how, in practice, administrative authority, demographic pressures, and resource constraints heighten fear or competition between groups. These ethnographic studies will further help to establish how episodes of communal conflict are understood in their local socio-cultural context, overwhelming traditional mechanisms of dispute resolution and possibly creating cycles of recurrent violence. <br/><br/>This project is relevant to the stability of countries in Africa and other developing regions, which share many of Ethiopia's economic and political characteristics. Its research will directly address the impact of decentralizing reforms, which are often promoted as an institutional solution to the competition over resources in multiethnic countries. Yet, it remains to be shown how decentralization affects the outbreak of violence between groups, particularly when those reforms can bring about a realignment of power at the local level. This project's findings will provide a better understanding of how institutional changes interact with demographic and resource pressures in fragile states. The lessons derived from this research will permit scholars and policymakers to craft institutional reforms better suited to preventing communal conflicts that often degenerate into complex humanitarian crises.

Research in psychology has shown that social exclusion changes the ways that people think about their social worlds, sensitizing them to relevant types of social information. Although social exclusion (unsurprisingly) makes people feel sad or hurt, a surprising finding from a number of studies is that social exclusion often leads to increased anger and aggression and that such aggression can even be directed towards individuals who did not do the excluding. The present research project builds on these findings and generates novel hypotheses by integrating a social psychological perspective on social exclusion with theories of sociality coming from evolutionary psychology. Specifically, this research applies the evolutionary psychological idea of hidden correlations. Hidden correlations are relationships that cannot necessarily be detected during one's own lifetime, but that can be detected by natural selection over deep time. These hidden correlations can drive the evolution of psychological processes, creating minds that expect certain correlations to exist, even if an individual would be otherwise unable to learn of them through experience. The proposed research therefore focuses on the hidden correlates of social exclusion.<br/><br/>Based on this, the present research, conducted by researchers Leda Cosmides and John Tooby at the Center for Evolutionary Psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, examines four related sets of hypotheses. The first study set examines the hidden correlates of different reasons for exclusion: Do different causes of exclusion lead to distinct responses? The second study set examines the hidden correlations between social exclusion and social devaluation (the extent to which others take - or fail to take - one's interests and welfare into account). This study set investigates how hidden correlates of social exclusion lead to antisocial reactions, such as aggression, as a means of 'bargaining' for better treatment. The third study set examines a surprising set of predictions made by thinking in terms of hidden correlations: Social exclusion will sensitize the mind to threats of predation, starvation, and illness and injury - all threats faced by excluded individuals in ancestral, but not necessarily modern, environments. Finally, across all study sets, the proposed research examines the biological mediators of the effects of social exclusion by measuring hormonal indicators of stress.

It is also this variability of materials that adds daunting complexity to image understanding. This research program aims to establish the theoretical and computational foundation for automatic visual understanding and recognition of real-world materials. The program tackles this challenging problem from three key aspects, namely, deriving 1) novel hybrid physically-based and data-driven representations of the spatial, angular, spectral, temporal, and scale variations of material appearance, 2) active and passive methods for estimating the values of physically-based parameters that govern material appearance, and 3) single-image material recognition methods that leverage physically-based optical parameters as priors or invariants to guide machine learning techniques. These research thrusts lead to a comprehensive set of computational tools to recognize materials in real-world images despite their complex appearance variations, such as recognizing rusted metals, discerning soft cloth from hard concrete, identifying different fat content of milks, and labeling image regions with material traits like soft, hard, rough, and heavy.<br/><br/>The capabilities resulting from this program are crucial to a broad range of scenarios, for instance, to enable humanoid robots to understand that it should not squeeze the soft hands of a child, autonomous vehicles to understand what regions to avoid in a rugged terrain, visual analyses of tissues to help medical diagnosis, and automated inspection systems to reliably discover sub-standard quality food to prevent ill-health. The PIs work with research groups in these specific application areas to closely integrate the results from this project into their efforts. The results from this research are also broadly disseminated via publications, websites, databases, new courses and symposiums.

Initial efforts will be directed toward the measurement of top pair production cross sections using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, followed by studies on top pair plus jets production. Ultimately, he hopes to progress to a study of Higgs produced with a top pair. To further this long-term research goal, this award includes support for research and development activities aimed at upgrading the CMS trigger to add information from the tracking system that is not currently used in the trigger. Finally, this award allows Professor Lannon to take advantage of a unique educational activity related to his research. The CMS collaboration has agreed to make a small fraction of the data it collects available to QuarkNet, an outreach program in high energy physics research involving high school students and teachers. Along with a colleague at Notre Dame, Lannon plans to create the necessary infrastructure for data collected by the QuarkNet trigger to be used by QuarkNet participants. Achieving this goal would create a long-term infrastructure that would allow high school students and teachers to share in the experience of doing cutting-edge high energy physics research. This infrastructure can be built upon by future efforts to bring this experience to students of all backgrounds, economic situations, and geographical locations through the use of web-based learning and collaboration tools.

Vascular plant, moss, lichen, and fungal specimens will be included in the project. Once digitized, we will place these records online for the public through an existing Web portal (http://www.pnwherbaria.org). We are leveraging the cyberinfrastructure (e.g., Ethernet, servers, technical staff) available at several large universities to build partnerships with smaller institutions that otherwise would not have the resources to undertake this activity.<br/><br/>Our project provides tangible benefits to the general public, undergraduate students, and the research community. Digitizing specimens and making them available online creates public access to collections that have been assembled in part through prior federal funding. The specimen data will be downloadable from the Web site, so anyone can use the information to pursue unique interests and questions. Undergraduate students will be involved extensively with imaging and data basing activities, providing them with skills and training applicable to future professional pursuits. Online availability of nearly 2 million Pacific Northwest herbarium specimens will increase access and efficiency for the research community using these collections.

This project will significantly enhance present and future access by improving storage of this research collection. To improve storage, this project will move specimens from current perilous conditions, caused by normal acidic off-gassing from wooden cabinets, into more accessible archival metal storage cabinets with archival specimen boxes. This project will increase the present and future availability of the collection and associated specimen data to support collection-based research by biodiversity conservation organizations and agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. This project will increase public education by making specimens more readily available to science-based public outreach programs, including tours, exhibits, and collaborative activities with other museum components. The project will educate and train volunteers and undergraduate work-study students, who are likely to include members of underrepresented groups (the PI's 7-year track record shows that 20% of 142 volunteers have been from underrepresented minority or ethnic groups, and 7% have had disabilities). The mollusk collection at CMNH is a major resource of international significance, being the largest collection of northern Appalachian non-marine mollusks and one of the top five freshwater mussel collections. Historically significant, the collection vouchers 100 years of research. Examples of recent collection use include molecular and morphological systematic studies (including five by students), environmental monitoring, training for mussel surveyors, and museum exhibits. Any thorough study of North American mollusks would refer to this collection. Information on the CMNH Collection of Mollusks can be found at http://www.carnegiemnh.org/mollusks/collection.htm.

This radiative approach is operationally specific to marine coccolithophores (Haptophyceae) and sensitive enough to quantify PIC concentrations in oligotrophic gyres. Global images of suspended PIC taken over the seven years of the MODIS Aqua mission show a 'Great Belt' of PIC near the sub-Antarctic front of the Southern Ocean that circles the globe. This feature occurs every year during austral summer and appears to be within the high-nutrient, low chlorophyll region of the Southern Ocean. The area of the Great Belt is ~88 million km2, 26% of the global ocean. Evidence from several cruises into the Great Belt region of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific sectors has verified elevated concentrations of coccolithophores; previous work in the Atlantic sector verified high optical scattering from PIC. The few ship observations we have are entirely consistent with the satellite views. In this project, the investigators will systematically study the coccolithophores of the Great Belt guided by the following science goals: (a) identify the coccolithophore species within this belt; (b) measure the abundance of coccolithophores and associated PIC; (c) measure coccolithopore calcification rates; (d) elucidate factors that may limit coccolithophore latitudinal range (e.g. stratification, temperature, macronutrients, trace metals, grazing); (e) demonstrate whether the variability in PIC relates to shallow export flux; (f) define how variability in PIC production relates to the pCO2, total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon budgets; and (g) examine the impact of short-term ocean acidification on coccolithophore growth and calcite dissolution. <br/><br/>The research will involve cruises along the 50 S parallel to sample the Great Belt, during the austral summer. The investigators will use a combination of underway surface sampling (primarily optical and hydrographic) and vertical station profiles (using CTD/rosette and large volume submersible pumps) to address hypotheses related to the above goals. The cruise track will elucidate both zonal and meridional variability in the Great Belt. Controlled carboy incubation experiments will examine the impact of ocean acidification at various future scenarios on coccolithophore growth and dissolution. Dilution experiments will address grazing-related mortality and dissolution questions. Controlled metal-addition incubations will focus on potential iron, zinc and cobalt limitation of the coccolithophores or competition from diatoms related to silica availability. The proposed field observations and metal-addition experiments will provide important information on the current status of the Great Belt in the context of global biogeochemistry. The ocean acidification experiments to be undertaken are more forward-looking in terms of the fate of the Southern Ocean coccolithophores in a future acidified ocean. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The globally significant size of the Great Belt indicates that it likely plays a major role in global biogeochemistry and climate change feedbacks. Thus, the investigators expect this work to have broad, transformative impacts in biological and chemical oceanography. Ocean acidification from the burning of fossil fuels is predicted to lower the pH of the surface ocean by 0.3 units in the next century and up to 0.7 units - a 5-fold increase in the proton concentration by the year 2300. A major goal of this study is to examine the effects of ocean acidification on coccolithophores in a region of low calcite saturation (i.e., one of the first regions expected to become sub-saturating for calcite). The results of these experiments will therefore be highly relevant to our basic understanding of the marine carbon cycle. Related to career development and Criterion II activities, the project includes field experience on two cruises for NSF REU undergraduates from Maine universities or colleges, providing funds for them to attend a scientific meeting. Participation of undergraduate students from Maine colleges builds capacity in our rural coastal state and helps thwart the serious issue of 'brain drain', in which the best students are leaving Maine to seek opportunity in wealthier, more populated states. A teacher will also participate on the cruises (via the NSF-sponsored ARMADA program). This teacher will develop learning modules for students about such topics as coccolithophores, calcification, export production, metal-plankton interactions, ocean acidification and climate change.

There is also a long-term trend towards less severe armed conflicts, though climate change threatens to reverse this favorable trend. Rising in temperatures are likely to cause drought and increase natural hazards (including floods and hurricanes). Resulting migration and in turn, conflict with host communities can lead to local scarcities, increasing the risk of conflict. Climate change will possibly weaken politically-unstable regimes in low-development countries, in turn strengthening the hand of insurgent movements challenging governments and adding to communal conflict. The PIs will look at specific physical phenomena (droughts and natural hazards) whose social and economic effects will then be traced to estimate the probable implications for conflict. The projected impacts of climate change will not result in elevated conflict risk in all societies but depends on country-specific and contextual factors. The investigation will take place at two scales, the regional and the local, for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Using a predictive model of the coupled natural (climate) and social (violence) systems, with feedback loops and mediating socio-political-economic variables, the PIs will measure the impact of adverse climate change and/or changes in climate variability on the rate of armed conflict, determine which mediating factors influence the rate of this impact, and project the violence outcomes on the basis of different climate change/variability scenarios. The data from the substantial climate, satellite imaged environmental (land-use), socio-economic and violence sources will be integrated in a geographic information system, with 100 kilometers grids being the primary scale of analysis. Local studies in selected contexts in East Africa (with the support of local research networks) will complement the statistical study by exploring the locally-varying processes linking climate/environmental change to violent events.<br/><br/>Efforts to assess the security implications of climate change have foundered on the paucity of empirical evidence and the lack of consensus in the scientific literature of the extent of the possible relationship. Recent statements by U.S. and international agencies propose climate change/variability as a threat multiplier to existing problems (poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership, and weak political institutions) that might threaten domestic stability in weak states. Possible impacts of climate change/variability are mediated by contextual conditions, especially governmental policies, socio-economic resources, and existing fractures along regional and ethnic lines. Sub-Saharan Africa has been identified as the most vulnerable region, with the possibility of significant intra-regional migration/emigration to escape a worsening quality of life leading to communal conflict over declining resources. The research will contribute to policy debates within the US and internationally which, to date, have skirted the issue due to unreliable conflict measures, debatable climate change indicators, information on local differences, and the lack of contact between the natural/climate science and conflict studies communities.

An organizationally-adept agent is not only aware of its role(s) in an organization, but can also monitor how well it is fulfilling its organizational responsibilities and can proactively adapt its behaviors to meet organizational needs better. Organizationally adept agents evaluate their behaviors based not on their (agent-centric) self-interests but rather on their (organization-centric) responsibilities to each other, and autonomously adapt to achieve organizational objectives emergently. <br/><br/>Elaboration and adaptation by organizationally adept agents means that the ultimate organization design is formed by a combination of top-down design (to produce a ballpark organization) and emergent refinement processes. Further, this combination can be iterative and ongoing, where organizationally adept agents can detect tension between top-down and emergent influences, and inform the design processes of runtime interaction patterns and environmental tendencies that suggest useful top-down organization restructurings. <br/><br/>The intellectual problems being pursued are central to practical issues in scaling multi-agent systems to help solve complex, long-term, global problems. Many critical challenges facing society including climate change, health care, and sustainable energy|require a prolonged commitment to monitoring and managing distributed activities. Networked computer systems populated by software agents, which can be constantly measuring, comparing, and interpreting information to understand and respond to wide-scale phenomena, promise to address such challenges, but need the kinds of innovations proposed in this project. Second, while the project is specifically looking at organizations for computational agents, our results will inform, and be informed by, research on human organizations. To stimulate sharing insights and results, the investigators will organize a multi-disciplinary symposium on organization-centric reasoning, and will train an inter-disciplinary cohort of graduate students.

N. U. Sumanto, supervised by Dr. Robert Hefner, will undertake research on interreligious violence, citizenship, and post-conflict peace in the Christian-Muslim conflict zone of Maluku, Eastern Indonesia. The project proposes to investigate first, factors underlying interreligious violence, and, second, factors shaping the post-conflict truce and efforts to rebuild an operative structure and public culture for multi-religious citizenship in the region. More specifically, the project aims to examine the role of religious networks, organizations, discourses, and practices before, during, and after the violence, investigating which social resources aggravated local tensions, and, conversely, which contributed or is contributing to the creation of a public culture capable of mediating ethnic and religious divisions. The central focus of the project, then, is to explore the dynamics of Maluku's religious groups and civic organizations in responding to violence and the post-conflict truce, and to examine the implications of religious networks, associations, and discourses for the peace and for local understandings and practices of national citizenship. The research will utilize (1) ethnographic fieldwork, (2) network and associational analysis, and (3) the study of historical and textual materials. <br/><br/>This project is important because it will contribute, first, to social science theories of violence, conflict resolution, citizenship, and peacemaking in multi-religious societies. Second, the project will contribute to the growing body of theory and research on the role of religion in deeply divided societies. More generally, this project will also be of direct relevance to the study of violence and reconciliation in those parts of the world that have suffered the ravages of mass violence.

Thus, hybrid zones represent unique opportunities to separate intrinsic and extrinsic causes of variation among animals. Furthermore, because a variety of animals are in direct competition, hybrid zones are also ideal locations for studies of competitive ability. This project focuses on two species of howler monkeys, Alouatta palliata and A. pigra, with different vocalizationsthat hybridize in a small region in southern Mexico. The research builds on previous morphological and genetic sampling of the hybrid zone and addresses two main questions: 1) what causes vocal variation among A. palliata, A. pigra, and hybrids? and, 2) how do different vocalizations impact competitive ability in the hybrid zone? To address these questions the project integrates molecular, morphological, behavioral, and acoustic data with playback experiments. Sources of vocal differences will be uncovered by comparing vocalizations among purebred and hybrid males to their genetic background, morphology, location, and social setting. The playback experiments involve both males and females and reveals the types of calls that males find intimidating or females find attractive (or both). The study examines the proximate and ultimate factors shaping primate vocalizations, how sexual selection structures admixture and gene flow, and how differences in vocalizations affect sexual selection. <br/><br/>The project is highly collaborative and will strengthen research ties at many levels; between departments at the University of Michigan, between the University of Michigan and Ohio State University, and internationally between US universities and the Universidad Veracruzana in Mexico. In addition to providing considerable training to Mexican and US students, the project will directly benefit conservation through an educational workshop directed to school-age children within the area of hybridization. Furthermore, the presence of a long-term study in the region and the inclusion of Mexican researchers and students will promote primate studies and conservation in Mexico, a country of high biogeographic importance for primates and other Neotropical taxa.

This project will digitize and consolidate specimen records from 10 bee collections across the United States. The investigators will make or verify species identifications, capture full label data, georeference and error-check localities, and upload this information to publicly accessible databases. Web-based tools will be used to capture data across collections efficiently, validate bee and plant names through automated comparison with taxonomic authority files, and synthesize data on species pages with images, digitized literature records, and other information about bees and their host plants. Data will be uploaded to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and to Discover Life (www.discoverlife.org), a website that features customizable global maps for all global bee species and dynamic identification keys for North American species. To obtain information needed to conserve and manage pollinators, the investigators will work with ecologists to model geographic and temporal trends in bee populations in relation to environmental variables. Bees are the most important pollinators of the approximately 1/3 of crops that require animal pollination. Recent declines in honey bee populations highlight the need to understand better the roles of native bees in agricultural and natural systems. This project will help predict risks to bees and their pollination services from climate change, habitat loss, and other factors. The outreach program Bee Hunt (www.discoverlife.org/bee) will educate the public, including students in underserved communities, about bee diversity and the importance of pollination services. Using digital photography and rigorous research protocols, Bee Hunt will empower people at biological field stations, nature centers, parks, schools, and other sites to collect high-quality data to augment information from specimen records.
0952291	ETBC: COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: MASS-DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT MERCURY ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION DURING MICROBIAL METHYLATION AND REDOX TRANSFORMATIONS OF MERCURY IN NATURAL WATERS	EAR	GEOBIOLOGY & LOW TEMP GEOCHEM, CZO: CRITICAL ZONE OBSER SOLIC	06/01/2010	09/23/2011	John Reinfelder	NJ	Rutgers University New Brunswick	Continuing grant	Enriqueta Barrera	05/31/2014	$397,757.00	Tamar Barkay	reinfelder@envsci.rutgers.edu	33 Knightsbridge Road	Piscataway	NJ	088543925	8489320150	GEO	7295, 7693	OTHR	$0.00	Intellectual merit: The proposed research is based on recent achievements by the PIs and others, and seeks to expand the PIs? on-going studies of isotopic fractionation during microbial and abiotic Hg transformations. During the last five years the PIs have shown that: (i) Mass dependent isotopic fractionation (MDF) occurred during the microbial reduction of ionic mercury (Hg[II]) by several bacterial strains that possess the enzyme mercuric reductase and MDF also occurred during microbial methylmercury (MeHg) degradation; (ii) Photoreduction of Hg(II) and photodegradation of MeHg caused MDF as well as mass independent fractionation (MIF) of up to 2?. Varying amounts of MIF (denoted as ƒ199Hg and ƒ201Hg) recorded in freshwater and marine fish tissue suggested different extents of photo degradation of MeHg prior to its incorporation into the aquatic food web. These results along with large variations in natural samples documented by the Blum lab and others, strongly suggest that the isotopic composition of Hg has the potential for distinguishing between different sources of Hg(0) emissions and pathways of Hg(II) reduction and MeHg degradation.<br/>To date, the PIs? studies have focused on Hg redox transformations and MeHg degradation. Yet, the bioaccumulation of MeHg in aquatic food webs has a profound effect on human and ecosystem health and the examination of whether or not isotope fractionation occurs during methylation of Hg is, therefore, a high priority. If significant fractionation occurs during formation of MeHg and is modulated by different environmental conditions and by the nature of the methylating processes, tools for distinguishing sources and pathways of MeHg in the environment may become available and enhance the management of Hg contaminated ecosystems. The first objective of the proposed study is the examination of isotopic fractionation during Hg methylation by sulfate and iron reducing bacteria to test the hypothesis that microbial Hg methylation results in significant MDF, but not in MIF. The second objective is the investigation of<br/>how environmental variables, which define freshwater and marine environments, impact MIF and MDF during Hg redox transformations to test the hypothesis that photochemical reduction, oxidation and demethylation will imprint diagnostic MDF and MIF signatures on reaction substrates and products. Finally, Hg isotopic fractionation during transformation pathways mediated by an important component of aquatic ecosystems, phototrophic planktonic organisms, has not been examined to date. The third objective addresses this lack of knowledge by testing the hypothesis that intracellular Hg(II) reduction and MeHg degradation in phytoplankton incubated in the light will result in MDF and possibly MIF. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The proposed research activity will continue to lay the groundwork for a new approach or the identification of sources, sinks, and pathways of Hg transformations in impacted ecosystems. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance understanding of Hg biogeochemistry on temporal and spatial scales ranging from molecular mechanisms, to ecosystems, to global cycles, and to the geological record. As ecosystem Hg contamination remains a major public health concern, this project will support implementation of sound environmental practices to reduce Hg contamination and exposure. The proposed research will train a postdoctoral fellow in the application of stable isotope-based approaches in geobiology and ecosystem processes. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students will be integrated into the project, exposing them to cutting edge concepts and technologies, which are at the interface between biology, geology and ecosystem sciences. It is at this interface that important<br/>paradigm-shifting, research advances are being made. Undergraduate students will assist with the analytical geochemistry as part of senior thesis research projects and PhD dissertation projects. Results will be published and disseminated broadly.
0962749	Using ancient DNA to understand the relationship between human biology and cultural practices in the Late Woodland and Mississippian Time Periods (AD 930-1200) in North America.

Ancient DNA methods are used to examine the importance of small-scale population movements in this change. DNA is analyzed from individuals at sites that span the Late Woodland and Mississippian periods (AD 930-1200) on the periphery of Cahokia, and from Mississippian individuals at Cahokia region sites. Analyses test the hypothesis of temporal genetic continuity at these sites, and determine whether alterations in mortuary practice reflect changing concepts of kinship. Fluoride dating will resolve the burial sequences at these sites.<br/>This project will significantly increase the genetic data from previously unstudied populations of prehistoric Native American peoples. Analyses will further our understanding of Native American prehistory and how culture is affected by movements of people, and provide the first genetic data from multiple Late Woodland mounds. Hypotheses regarding Late Woodland and Mississippian mortuary practices and kinship will be tested. This is the basis for a larger regional study of prehistoric genetic diversity and disease, and will be used to investigate familial factors in research on prehistoric tuberculosis infection patterns.<br/><br/>This project provides educational opportunities at multiple levels. This research is part of the dissertation of three female graduate students. The development of the Fluoride Dating Lab enhances options for graduate and undergraduate training and provides a direct benefit to regional anthropologists. Results will be utilized in outreach programs to local K-12 schools and museums. A symposium will be organized at the Midwest Archaeological Conference. These results may aid in policy formation by government institutions and museums with respect to Native populations.

Space shuttles are launched not only on the basis of weather forecasts, but also on an engineer's subjective opinion that a part will or will not fail. Military missions and political policies are put in place using intelligence analysts' beliefs that an event will occur or has occurred. Without doubt the use of probability judgments to make decisions makes the accuracy of subjective probabilities of utmost importance. Indeed the accuracy of subjective probabilities has been well studied in the cognitive and decision sciences. Yet, an equally valuable aspect of subjective probabilities is the amount of time it takes judges to formulate their estimates. Clearly, the time a judge takes to make a probability judgment has external costs to both the judge and the decision maker. Yet, little is known about the internal time course of subjective probability judgments. Consequently, the impact these external costs have on subjective probabilities and their accuracy is not known.<br/><br/>In this project the Principal Investigator pursues research examining how variables external to the judge (e.g., time pressure; rewards and penalties) and internal to the judge (e.g., attention and sequential effects) impact the time course and accuracy of subjective probabilities. A general framework called Judgment Field Theory will integrate how these internal and external variables impact probability judgments. Moreover, the framework offers a cognitive account of how different descriptions of the same event (e.g., Lance Armstrong will win the race vs. Lance Armstrong won?t lose the race) change how judges evaluate the likelihood of an event occurring and how this evaluation changes as a function of time. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the research are three-fold. First, the research will help in the development of methods to evaluate the accuracy of subjective probabilities. These methods can ultimately be used to improve the accuracy of judges. Second, the theoretical framework will be used in the development of an undergraduate psychological methods course curriculum that infuses a traditional methods course with techniques of cognitive modeling. Finally, a broader impact is the outreach to and integration of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students into cognitive science at MSU.

T he apparent consensus regarding the impermeability of their categorical boundaries has two roots. The first was the scientific revolution of the Renaissance, predicated in large part upon the rise of Copernican cosmology, empiricism, and the systematic development of modern mathematics, physics, biology, and chemistry. The second was the gradual institutionalization of disciplinary divisions in the faculties of the modern university, which in the 19th century culminated in the segregation of the European educational system between classical studies and scientific and technical training. Despite the legacy of a modern-day institutional compartmentalization that seeks to distance the arts (and the humanities of which they are a part) from the natural sciences, they revolve within a shared history characterized as much by negotiation, mutual learning, and symbiosis as by pronouncements of fundamental difference. The recognition of this shared history as well as a desire to draw upon it as both intellectual resource and source material helps drive the emergence of what has been termed the new Leonardos and Renaissance teams, a loosely held movement that thrives upon the collaboration between artists and scientists. The participants in these collaborations have forged new intellectual pathways, often articulating areas of study that combine insights from the sciences and humanities. This international collaborative research project will explore the institutional, political, epistemic, and technological matrices that both allow for these interfaces to emerge and that shape their development and wider impact. The investigators will conduct a multi-sited study of contemporary collaborative projects involving diverse groups of scientists and artists in the United States and the United Kingdom. Major questions that the investigators address include: What sorts of resources (material, financial, and regulatory) are marshaled for the collaborations? How and why do artists engage with and reinterpret a range of scientific practices? Why are scientists interested in artistic representations of their work? What new forms of public access are created when scientists open their laboratories to artists? How do such collaborations tackle the ethical and political dimensions of complex problems? How do these collaborations allow for a shift to occur regarding how participants and their various audiences understand the content and purpose of art and science as well as their place within society? In pursuing these questions, the investigators will employ participant observation, interviews, focus groups, surveys, and visual interpretative methods in order to generate detailed descriptions and analyses of the day-to-day activities and products of five sites of art-science collaboration. In addition to previously used approaches, the investigators will focus particular attention on geographic aspects of the interactions among scientists and artists in order to recognize the spatial situatedness of people, things and the relations that bind and transform them.<br/><br/>The project will make a substantial contribution toward understanding how lessons learned can be transposed into other contexts, thereby developing and realizing models for public outreach at different sites. Because the examination of science-art collaborations often entails the advancement of public knowledge about a number of contemporary world-wide crises and discoveries, the project will serve as a study of the development of innovative strategies for the delivery of popular education and knowledge transfer devoted to timely, policy-related issues of the larger public interest. The project will aid in the mapping of a broad network of emerging resources for further collaborations across the humanities and social and physical sciences, making it a resource for researchers and funding agencies seeking to develop new directions in research collaboration. The project also has the potential to have a transformative impact upon funding agencies. As interdisciplinary, collaborative projects, funded by both public and private foundations and occurring both inside and outside the bounds of the academy become more widespread, projects like this one can help provide a model for investigation and a baseline for assessing their effects and effectiveness.
0964646	CIF: Medium: Collaborative Research: From Retroactivity to Modularity: Design and Implementation of a Genetic Insulation Device in Yeast	CCF	ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS, COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY	10/01/2010	07/25/2013	Ron Weiss	MA	Massachusetts Institute of Technology	Continuing grant	Mitra Basu	09/30/2014	$442,500.00		rweiss@mit.edu	77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE	Cambridge	MA	021394301	6172531000	CSE	7796, 7931	9218, HPCC	$0.00	From Retroactivity to Modularity:<br/>Design and Implementation of a Genetic Insulation Device in Yeast<br/>Domitilla Del Vecchio and Ron Weiss<br/><br/>Modularity is an important property of engineered systems, yet it is debatable whether it is a general property of natural bio-molecular systems. Discovering the extent of modularity and understanding its mechanisms is one of the most important open research problems in systems biology. Furthermore, the long term success of synthetic biology critically depends on the ability to implement modular systems in such a way that the properties of individual components do not change unpredictably upon their interconnection. Our proposed research seeks to understand the mechanisms of modularity in regulatory networks using a combined theoretical/experimental effort through the design, implementation, and analysis of a special genetic retroactivity insulation device in yeast. This novel device effectively decouples transcriptional components that would otherwise be highly interlocked by allowing propagation of a regulatory signal in the forward direction while minimizing the undesired phenomena of retroactivity in the reverse direction. Besides providing an important new circuit element for synthetic biologists, the mathematical analysis of an insulating device will lead to an improved understanding of the extent to which modularity is present in regulatory networks in biological systems. The first aim of our research is to show that retroactivity affects regulatory networks without insulation and therefore that modularity is not a natural property of bio-molecular signaling pathways. Second, we will demonstrate a novel insulation device that counteracts retroactivity and allows a circuit to transmit information reliably despite loading from downstream clients. This special circuit will be designed and placed between two connected components to insulate them from retroactivity effects. We will study the device?s performance, ability to regulate many copies of a downstream component, and requirements for correct operation. Third, we will study how well the insulation device is decoupled from the cellular environment. To this end, we will perform system-level analysis and investigate crosstalk between the device and various important cellular processes.<br/> Intellectual Merit: Existing synthetic circuits lack an ability to insulate a driving input signal from retroactivity of the output load, precluding modular composition of complex biocircuits. To address this problem, we propose to construct and characterize a synthetic phosphorylation-based insulation device and instrumentation pathway that will demonstrate a general and modular technique for building sophisticated, large scale biological systems. Our novel technique leverages the integration of special rapid feedback mechanisms into biocircuits in order to create insulation devices, and hence has implications for the design and implementation of many other biological motifs and networks. Our research includes new theoretical and computational analysis of devices with feedback and retroactivity, and these new tools will also be applicable for the study of biological network problems other than retroactivity. This analysis is fundamentally important for tuning and characterizing desired insulation properties while minimizing interference with other cellular processes.<br/> Broader Impact: In synthetic biology, this research will lead to a general understanding of the engineering principles of modularity for bio-molecular systems design. Likewise, in systems biology, this research will address a fundamental question ? To what extent is modularity an inherent property of biological systems? The product of our collaborative efforts will lead to the discovery in natural systems of motifs similar to our insulation device and to the explanation of how modularity is achieved, including insight into when and where natural systems implement modularity and for what purposes. Ultimately, the resulting capability of modular composition to achieve defined engineering goals in biological systems will have tremendous impact on human therapeutics, including regenerative medicine, diabetes, and cancer therapy, as well as in other diverse areas, including biofuel production, environmental remediation, pharmaceutical production, and biosensing applications. This research will contribute to new interdisciplinary courses and will be integrated into a ten week undergraduate synthetic biology Summer program that culminates in an international competition and has a track record of attracting women, under-represented groups, and high schools students to the field.

Biological systems, including the cell division process which plays a major role in development and cancer, immune response and circadian rhythm (which governs our behavior over the course of a day) are similarly activated across many different species. Indeed, much of the progress in understanding these systems was achieved by studying their behavior in model organisms. When using expression experiments, which measure the level of genes at different time points and in different conditions, to study these systems, researchers often identify hundreds, or even thousands, of genes as being expressed in each of the species. This makes it hard to analyze the resulting sets and to accurately identify genes that control key aspects of the system. In addition, our ability to correctly detect interactions among these genes is greatly reduced since many potential interactions can be used to explain the observed expression values. This joint computational-experimental project will allow us to identify a core set of genes; genes which are conserved in both sequence and expression across multiple species. <br/><br/>These genes represent key components of the biological system, are essential to its proper maintenance and function and would be used for further studies and for initial modeling. Predictions made by our method for these systems will be validated by new biological experiments which will in turn be used to further refine the computational model leading to a computational-experimental loop. As part of the proposal we will also develop an open source software package for cross species expression analysis. We will also develop and offer a new class on the analysis and use of cross species genomics data.

The experimental work will be performed in a new soccer ball turbulence facility that will be built as part of the project. The new facility will be capable of producing isotropic turbulence with a Reynolds number (based on the Taylor microscale) of 500.  Into this flow, we will introduce metal coated hollow glass spheres and image those spheres using an advanced version of digital holographic particle image velocimetry (DHPIV). Using a unique optical setup, we will image the particles in single and double exposure modes to obtain position and velocity statistics. Additionally, we will perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) that will be used to: (i) advance the DHPIV technique; and (ii) complement the experimental measurements.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The measurements we propose to make in the lab and in silico will allow us to quantify two important aerosol processes: (i) two-particle dispersion of inertial particles; and (ii) inertial particle collision rates, both for the first time. DHPIV will capture position and relative velocity statistics, and through kinematic relationships these data will be used to quantify the dispersion rate and the collision kernel as a function of the particle parameters (Stokes numbers) and Reynolds number. The new facility, combined with a judicious choice of particles, will allow us to isolate the effects of each parameter. A crucial aspect of the velocity measurement is the accurate pairing of particles in the two images. Current algorithms do not work well for inertial particles that don't necessarily follow the flow or remain highly correlated. With the aid of DNS, we will develop a new matching algorithm based on sweeping the time lapse between images.  The DNS too will be advanced under this study. Our current algorithm is capable of performing 10243 simulations on our 32-node cluster. However, in order to match the conditions of the proposed experiments, we must increase the resolution. We will modify the data structure of our code so as to take advantage of recent developments in the 3D fast Fourier transform. The new code will be able to run on 100's and even 1000's of processors on the Texas Advanced Computing Center, enabling 20483 simulations and Reynolds numbers of 500. In this way, we will continue our tradition of making quantitative comparisons with the experiments. Additionally, DNS yields more information than the experiments about the flow field, as well as allows us to study Lagrangian statistics. We will perform these studies to test assumptions we have made in the analysis of the experiments, as well as to advance our theoretical understanding of particle dispersion and collision.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>The motion of discrete particles in a turbulent fluid is of great significance to a broad range of engineering flows as well as natural flows. From understanding the competition between growth and oxidation of soot particles in a diesel engine, to quantifying the impact these particles have on the global climate, we are challenged to describe the dispersive and collisional properties of particles in order to get these predictions right. Historically our understanding of turbulence has gone hand-in-hand with our ability to measure the key variables, either experimentally or computationally. The goal of this proposal is to measure the statistical quantities that will allow us to quantify these two important aerosol processes. These results will stimulate an exciting new theoretical understanding, both within our group and elsewhere. Our approach is unconventional in that we intermingle DNS and experiment completely. Indeed, a strength of this work has been our ability to make quantitative comparisons between DNS and experiments. We meet weekly via videoconference to thoroughly discuss all aspects of the work. This provides a rich environment for students, who are exposed, at a high level, to all of the activities. The PIs have been heavily involved with outreach throughout their careers. Recent activities include recruitment and mentoring of women and underrepresented minorities at their respective institutions, outreach within the community, and organization of a series of high profile workshops at the NSF directed towards encouraging underrepresented minorities into the academy.

Transposable elements are pervasive across the genomes of higher order organisms and are a fundamental force behind genomic evolution. They are also are one of the key data sources for studying evolutionary processes at the genomic level. But while effective algorithmic methods exist for the identification of transposable elements that have retained sufficient sequence similarity to their progenitor, the capability of these methods quickly diminishes when searching for transposable elements that have experienced a higher level of sequence decay due to age or presence in more evolutionary volatile genomic regions. The key research results of this study will include 1) the mathematical formulation and implementation of an algorithm underlying a comprehensive de novo generation of transposable element libraries, 2) a fast, sensitive search tool for transposable elements based on that library, 3) a model of transposable element domain structure leading to the improvement of transposable element discovery, 4) an improved understanding of mammalian neutral substitution rates from a transposable element based analysis, and 5) adaptation of the same methodology of neutral substitution rate analysis to plant genomes and a comprehensive study of rate variation in plants.<br/><br/>This grant will also provide an opportunity to develop aspects of a comprehensive bioinformatics program using the proposed research as the background for the introduction of new students into the field. In addition to using the problem of transposable element annotation as the basis for an introductory programming class targeted towards undergraduate biologists, an online Bioinformatics course will be developed and implemented with the goal of allowing the remote teaching of the subject at schools without the resources to maintain their own program. To this end, we will specifically target Berea College, an institution exclusively serving economically disadvantaged students, developing a bioinformatics module to be incorporated into certain courses and an annual workshop designed to expose their students to the field.

Purchase of new cabinets will allow the PI to move more than 13,250 specimens of mammals, representing 26 of 29 extant orders, into a single location. Specimens have heretofore been stored in three different locations in six different designs of cabinets, ranging from modern steel cases to secretarial supply cabinets and cabinets hand made by Curator Emeritus Bryan P. Glass and his students during 1940-1950s. Not only have specimens been inadequately protected, but the diversity of cabinet designs and dimensions results in inefficient use of newly renovated space allocated to COV in 2009. New cabinets will alleviate currently poor storage conditions, improve use of newly renovated space, and allow thoughtful and steady expansion for research and teaching. Osteological material will be housed in dust-free cabinets, and fragile tanned hides will be moved into custom cabinets similar to those for large, fragile textiles. This project also facilitates reorganization of specimens to reflect current taxonomy. The resulting improvements in storage conditions and organization will facilitate collaborations with Art Department programs at OSU, increase accessibility to the public of northern Oklahoma, and enhance collaboration with K-12 programs in the Colleges of Engineering, Architecture, and Technology and Education. The PI will offer a multidisciplinary course in curatorial practices supported by this award. In addition to students enrolled in the course, the project will provide direct support to one doctoral and three undergraduate students and will supplement existing practicum experiences for approximately five undergraduates per semester.

Most of this work will utilize fast neutrons produced at UK's accelerator laboratory and the radiation detection capabilities developed in this laboratory. The broad-based research program will include selected studies of nuclei undergoing shape oscillations and transitions, the roles of protons and neutrons in nuclear excitations, nuclear shell structure, and data relevant to rare decay modes. Nuclear level lifetime measurements, for which the methodology has been developed over many years in our laboratory, provide crucial information in many of these investigations. Additional projects that are particularly appropriate to the capabilities available at the UK accelerator laboratory will be pursued, and collaborative research with colleagues from other institutions is emphasized.<br/><br/>Education at the graduate and post-graduate levels is an integral part of all activities in our laboratory, and graduates of this program are trained nuclear scientists who are important in meeting our national needs. Providing a supportive professional experience for students is an ongoing, vital component of our program, and these students enthusiastically participate in experiments at other facilities, scientific conferences, and the activities of professional societies. Research at a small accelerator laboratory, such as ours, permits the mentoring of young scientists on a daily basis. For many years, the research facilities of our laboratory have been made available to students and faculty from non-doctoral-granting institutions, as well as scientists from other research universities, national laboratories, and nuclear-related industry. Research performed in our laboratory has contributed directly to national interests, such as homeland security and the design of advanced nuclear reactors, and will continue to do so. These applications are well represented by the activities of government and industrial partners who utilize our accelerator and research equipment. For example, collaborative studies with colleagues from industry have led to improved neutron-detection-based methods for the inspection of luggage for explosives and illegal drugs, and data obtained in our laboratory has been used to evaluate direct energy-storage devices. In each case, the unique capabilities of our laboratory were important considerations in the selection of our facility for this work.

The approach applies a series of algorithms that implement a form of three-dimensional, migration inversion. Three-component waveforms of body waves recorded by the TA are manipulated in a manner similar to seismic reflection processing to produce a three-dimensional image volume of P to S scattering strength beneath the continent. The method is being used to produce high-resolution images of the subducting lithosphere of the Juan de Fuca/Farallon system and to develop a 3D model of the geometry of that system. As the array moves eastward the method will be used to image lithospheric scale boundaries that can be applied to test models of how the Precambrian core of the continent was assembled. Technical problems being attacked to improve the capabilities of this new method are: (1) extension of the method to image S to P conversions, (2) new methods for estimating the impulse response of the medium (deconvolution), (3) improved handling of irregular data that are the norm for passive arrays, (4) improved error appraisal metrics, and (5) multiple removal. Broader impacts include support for a PhD student's research and plans to make 3D image volumes available via the web.
0952108	ETBC: COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: MASS-DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT MERCURY ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION DURING MICROBIAL METHYLATION AND REDOX TRANSFORMATIONS OF MERCURY IN NATURAL WATERS	EAR	GEOBIOLOGY & LOW TEMP GEOCHEM	06/01/2010	09/26/2011	Joel Blum	MI	University of Michigan Ann Arbor	Continuing grant	Enriqueta Barrera	05/31/2014	$262,402.00		jdblum@umich.edu	3003 South State St. Room 1062	Ann Arbor	MI	481091274	7347636438	GEO	7295	OTHR	$0.00	Intellectual merit: The proposed research is based on recent achievements by the PIs and others, and seeks to expand the PIs? on-going studies of isotopic fractionation during microbial and abiotic Hg transformations. During the last five years the PIs have shown that: (i) Mass dependent isotopic fractionation (MDF) occurred during the microbial reduction of ionic mercury (Hg[II]) by several bacterial strains that possess the enzyme mercuric reductase and MDF also occurred during microbial methylmercury (MeHg) degradation; (ii) Photoreduction of Hg(II) and photodegradation of MeHg caused MDF as well as mass independent fractionation (MIF) of up to 2?. Varying amounts of MIF (denoted as ƒ199Hg and ƒ201Hg) recorded in freshwater and marine fish tissue suggested different extents of photo degradation of MeHg prior to its incorporation into the aquatic food web. These results along with large variations in natural samples documented by the Blum lab and others, strongly suggest that the isotopic composition of Hg has the potential for distinguishing between different sources of Hg(0) emissions and pathways of Hg(II) reduction and MeHg degradation.<br/>To date, the PIs? studies have focused on Hg redox transformations and MeHg degradation. Yet, the bioaccumulation of MeHg in aquatic food webs has a profound effect on human and ecosystem health and the examination of whether or not isotope fractionation occurs during methylation of Hg is, therefore, a high priority. If significant fractionation occurs during formation of MeHg and is modulated by different environmental conditions and by the nature of the methylating processes, tools for distinguishing sources and pathways of MeHg in the environment may become available and enhance the management of Hg contaminated ecosystems. The first objective of the proposed study is the examination of isotopic fractionation during Hg methylation by sulfate and iron reducing bacteria to test the hypothesis that microbial Hg methylation results in significant MDF, but not in MIF. The second objective is the investigation of<br/>how environmental variables, which define freshwater and marine environments, impact MIF and MDF during Hg redox transformations to test the hypothesis that photochemical reduction, oxidation and demethylation will imprint diagnostic MDF and MIF signatures on reaction substrates and products. Finally, Hg isotopic fractionation during transformation pathways mediated by an important component of aquatic ecosystems, phototrophic planktonic organisms, has not been examined to date. The third objective addresses this lack of knowledge by testing the hypothesis that intracellular Hg(II) reduction and MeHg degradation in phytoplankton incubated in the light will result in MDF and possibly MIF. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The proposed research activity will continue to lay the groundwork for a new approach or the identification of sources, sinks, and pathways of Hg transformations in impacted ecosystems. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance understanding of Hg biogeochemistry on temporal and spatial scales ranging from molecular mechanisms, to ecosystems, to global cycles, and to the geological record. As ecosystem Hg contamination remains a major public health concern, this project will support implementation of sound environmental practices to reduce Hg contamination and exposure. The proposed research will train a postdoctoral fellow in the application of stable isotope-based approaches in geobiology and ecosystem processes. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students will be integrated into the project, exposing them to cutting edge concepts and technologies, which are at the interface between biology, geology and ecosystem sciences. It is at this interface that important<br/>paradigm-shifting, research advances are being made. Undergraduate students will assist with the analytical geochemistry as part of senior thesis research projects and PhD dissertation projects. Results will be published and disseminated broadly.

The availability of protein function annotations supports the everyday work of biologists in multiple areas---from biomedical discovery to the study of plant drought resistance, and the design of bacteria useful in biofuel production.  Assigning function to proteins in sequenced genomes is a major undertaking, and with new organisms being sequenced daily, experimentally determining the function of all the proteins in those organisms is not practical, requiring computational assignment of function to proteins that have not been studied in the lab.  Computational scientists have been considering the problem of function prediction for over two decades.  Yet, the basic methodology for protein function prediction has not changed much during this time and remains that of annotation transfer from proteins with a known function using a method for sequence comparison such as BLAST.  Protein function prediction has several properties that make it difficult to apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods to this problem, such as the large number of potential functions (thousands of possible terms), the fact that proteins can have multiple functions, and the hierarchical relationship between terms in the Gene Ontology (GO), which is the standard system of keywords used to describe protein function.  In this work the problem of annotating proteins with GO terms will be explicitly modeled as a hierarchical classification problem using the methodology of kernel methods for structured outputs, which allows the modeling of complex prediction problems.  This methodology will allow the PIs to integrate a variety of genomic information - sequence data, gene expression, protein-protein interactions, and information mined from the biological literature.  The award will lead to a function prediction method with state-of-the-art accuracy.  The project will have broad impact by providing the GOstruct method to the bioinformatics and biology communities in the form of downloadable software and an online-accessible function prediction server. Education will be impacted through the incorporation of the tool into new courses in programming for biologists and on kernel methods.

The PIs will focus on three topics: 1) accuracy and completeness of the gas phase emission inventory with an emphasis upon understanding emission sector contributions; 2) analysis of ozone indicator species, photochemical processing of volative organic compounds (VOCs) and related features of VOC/NOx (nitrogen oxide) limitations in the region; and 3) investigation of particulate emissions and aging with an emphasis upon partitioning of semi-volatile compounds (SVOC) between gas and vapor phases. The end products will be a better understanding of ozone and aerosol formation and fate within this megacity region and a better basis for placing the impact of this megacity in perspective with respect to future change in China. In the three week field program, the PIs will operate from a tall flux tower. This will involve chemical speciation of ambient VOCs and size distributions of aerosols coupled with NOy, CO, SO2, and O3 measurements and boundary layer lidar sensing. This work will be carried out in collaboration with scientists from the local Tianjin University as well as with NCAR scientists, who will be at the field site during the same time period (September 2010).<br/><br/>Gaining an initial understanding of atmospheric chemical cycles within this region will benefit overall understanding of megacity impacts on regional and global chemistry and thus benefit societal decisions regarding global change. The work will also target undergraduate and graduate student education through the PIs' NSF REU atmospheric chemistry program and a new and novel Atmospheric Policy Trajectory (APT) program.

Around 500 people in Buon Trap town consider themselves as Bih ethnically, but fewer than 30 people are fluent in Bih. This supports the fear that the generation of elderly adults is the last generation speaking Bih. This doctoral dissertation project will contribute toward the preservation of the language by providing the first-ever orthography of Bih. Co-PI Tam Nguyen of the University of Oregon will undertake significant onsite work with the language. The co-PI will record natural language data in the form of conversations, folklore, songs and other forms of discourse. These oral texts supplemented with word-by-word elicitation when appropriate will contribute vocabulary toward the development of a Bih/Rade/English/Vietnamese dictionary.<br/><br/>A Bih/Rade/English/Vietnamese dictionary promises to offer a significant contribution to linguistics and related fields as there are no grammars, dictionaries or scholarly publications available on the language to date. A detailed documentation of the Bih lexicon contributes to the field of Austronesian historical linguistics, particularly to Vietnamese scholars interested in the reconstruction of proto-history, such as anthropology, archaeology, folklore, art-history and population genetics. First and foremost, the project will be of use to the Bih people who exhibit the fear of their language loss and wish to have written forms of their lexicon for language preservation. As collaboration with the University of Tay Nguyen and the Center of Daklak Ethnic Research is included, the proposed project is carefully designed to meet the needs of the speaking community as well as those of the academic communities.

They can be produced when the pressure on a liquid that contains gas is reduced, when a can of Coca Cola is opened, for example. Bubbles also form in the turbulence around the propeller of a ship or when a liquid is heated above its boiling point. In some situations, bubble production has undesirable effects. For example, over the course of time the bubbles produced near the propeller of a ship, damage the propeller. On the other hand, bubble generation can also be very useful, as in an ultrasonic cleaner. The long-range goal of this research is the study of how bubbles are formed and how to control the formation for technological advantage. Experiments will be performed to investigate bubble production in liquid helium under a number of different conditions. Liquid helium is chosen for these experiments because it can be produced with exceptional purity, and so effects that might arise from impurities in the liquid can be controlled or eliminated. The research project will contribute to the national need for scientists trained in the technically important fields of optics, cryogenics, fluid mechanics and computer simulation.<br/><br/><br/>****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****<br/><br/>An electron injected into liquid helium forces open a small cavity, producing an electron bubble of radius 2 nm. This individual investigator award supports research that includes several projects to study these bubbles and to use them to investigate the properties of quantized vortices. The first project will be to investigate the exotic ions, electron bubbles of unknown structure that are smaller than normal bubbles. In a second project a study will be made of electron bubbles in which the electron has been optically excited to the 1D quantum state. The third project is to attach electron bubbles to quantized vortices and by imaging these electrons, study the motion of the vortices. This work is exciting because electron bubbles are unique quantum systems with a size and shape of the bubble determined by the quantum state of the electron. Their study can answer fundamental questions concerning the nature of the measurement process in quantum mechanics. The research is a combination of experiment and theory, and includes collaboration with groups in Paris and Barcelona. With the combination of these components, the research is an excellent means for the training of graduate students and undergraduates.

The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.<br/><br/>This award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Jason J. Amsden to work with Dr. ChangHee Lee at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea. <br/><br/>Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices offer an intriguing alternative to silicon based devices due to their ease of processing, mechanical flexibility, and low cost. However, at present the power conversion efficiency of OPV is still too low to compete with silicon based devices. Two possibilities for improving the power conversion efficiency in OPV include use of new low band gap high mobility polymers and use of hybrid materials incorporating semiconducting polymers and semiconductor nanocrystals. Polymers with a low band gap more efficiently collect solar radiation and semiconductor nanocrystals such as zinc oxide are advantageous because of their high electron mobility compared to organic molecules, solution processing, and tunable band gap. <br/>This research studies for the first time the morphology and charge transport properties of zinc oxide nanocrystal and low band gap polymer hybrid photovoltaic devices. The project will include two main components: The first objective is characterization of the interaction and charge transport properties between low band gap polymers and zinc oxide nanocrystals in various morphologies using various types of spectroscopy and microscopy. The second parallel objective is to investigate the photovoltaic performance of hybrid devices using the insights gained from spectroscopy and microscopy.<br/><br/>In addition to the obvious benefit of increased knowledge about organic photovoltaic materials for solar energy conversion, this research will help develop new international collaboration between the PI and research groups at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea (Prof. ChangHee Lee and Prof. Do Yeung Yoon), at the Max Plank Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany (Prof. Klaus M¸llen), and at Boston University in Boston, USA (Prof. Kenneth J.

A comprehensive mathematical framework will be developed for describing the control of fluid flows at low Reynolds number through localized cyclic boundary deformations using concepts from differential geometry and dynamical systems theory. A high-fidelity numerical approach will be developed for simulating such problems using a viscous vortex particle method. A pair of experimental platforms on contrasting physical scales will be constructed, each comprising a system of reconfigurable resonant probes mimicking cilia observed in nature, and extensive data will be collected to calibrate both theoretical and computational models. Algorithmic methods for separating and sorting particles, and for tailoring the spatial trajectories of individual particles, will be devised and demonstrated experimentally. <br/><br/>The project focuses on developing and demonstrating a novel technique for separating and manipulating fragile microscopic objects immersed in fluids, which has a growing list of applications ranging from the mechanical testing of macromolecules like DNA to the assisted fertilization of human ova with immotile sperm to the sustained excitation of fluid-borne abrasive particles for the precision machining of brittle surfaces. Models will be developed to predict the trajectories of particles in fluids containing multiple vortex fields. These vortex fields will be produced experimentally using oscillating fibers. A pair of experimental platforms with millimeter and micrometer (1/1000 of a millimeter) physical scales will be constructed. For each platform, a system of reconfigurable resonant probes will be used to generate steady vortex fields in particle-bearing fluids. The smallest probes will mimic the microscopic oscillating cilia observed in nature. Data will be collected to validate the theoretical and computational predictive models. This project will not only engender integrated advancements in applied mathematics, computational science, and engineering, but will also shed light on the physics underlying a physiological design present in protozoa and humans alike. The micromanipulation method to be developed represents an improvement over alternative technologies in simplicity, portability, and cost. The PIs' plan for developing this method incorporates a multi-institutional collaboration involving the directed mentoring of at least one postdoctoral researcher, at least two PhD students, and a number of undergraduates (with a deliberate eye toward promoting diversity), the curricular expansion of two cross-disciplinary graduate courses and two undergraduate courses at the PIs' universities, and outreach to biology students at a third university and to high school students in an ethnically diverse area.

The project focuses on high accuracy electronic structure characterization of molecular clusters held together by weak non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and dispersion interactions. Non-covalent clusters have significance in almost every area of the physical and biological sciences, playing key roles in everything from solvation to the physical, chemical, and electronic properties of materials in the solid phase. <br/><br/>The project has two goals: (1) Development and implementation of multi-centered (MC) integrated electronic structure methods (e.g., MO:MO, QM:QM, QM:MM and ONIOM) for the evaluation of molecular properties such as dipole moments, harmonic vibrational frequencies, NMR shielding constants among others; and (2) Application of the methodology for studying chemical physics of water clusters and micro-solvation phenomena. Of particular interest are the electronic and vibrational structure of water clusters at the crossover from 2D to 3D hydrogen bonding networks, the blue-shifted vibrational frequencies of azabenzenes in the condensed phase, and the relationship between the energy of complexation and solvent polarity for aromatic º-type interactions between electron rich 1,5-dialkoxynaphthalenes and electron deficient 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylicdiimides.Broader impact activities include a continued effort to mentor female and underrepresented students at the undergraduate and graduate level. Software developed during the project is made freely available. In addition, the large body of benchmark data generated as a by-product during the calibration of the MC integrated technique is collected, organized and distributed in a public and accessible database.

A combination of laboratory experimentation, numerical simulations and theoretical approaches will be applied to this investigation, which will in-part hinge on a geometric photon tracing method to better determine radiative scattering properties of contaminated ice at both visible and infrared wavelengths. A systematic analysis will be undertaken to improve physical understanding and insight into computationally efficient methodologies deriving snow albedo (i.e. energy reflectance) from a radiative transfer model representing both single and multiple snow layers that include a variety of combinations of snow grain size and shape, black carbon/dust-snow mixtures, and realistic variations of the incident angle of solar radiation.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this work relates to providing a firm theoretical and model-based foundation for reducing uncertainties in climate system forcing associated with changing atmospheric and snowpack conditions. <br/><br/>Broader impacts will derive from improved ability to anticipate rapid changes in snowcover via improved model predictions and associated improvements in water resource management in sensitive areas, including but not limited to glaciated mountains and polar regions, as well as through student education at both graduate and undergraduate levels.

Many questions remain unresolved about the general theoretical problem of designing optimal voting mechanisms to efficiently aggregate preferences and information, without explicit side payments, and also about actual behavior under such mechanisms. Theoretically, there are questions of the relative performance of different voting mechanisms, where performance can be evaluated relative to several different objectives, including economic efficiency, informational efficiency, and equity. The research approaches voting behavior from a mechanism design perspective, and compares the performance of different voting mechanisms in different kinds of environments. The research encompasses five projects in political economy. Three of these projects will explore promising extensions of the research initiated under the current grant. These are: (1) The Dynamic Political Economy of Public Infrastructure; (2) Strategic Voting and Information Acquisition in Committees; and (3) Vote Trading in Committees. The first follows naturally from the dynamic political bargaining model studied under the current grant. Bargaining agreements evolve over time, with past bargaining outcomes setting the table for current and future rounds of bargaining. We extend that pure private good model to incorporate a dimension of durable public goods, or public infrastructure. We propose to compare the effects of different voting rules and government organization on the bargaining process, especially with respect to the effects on efficient investment in public infrastructure. The second project evolved from experimental studies conducted by the PI and collaborators on the swing voter's curse, a phenomenon whereby less informed voters have incentives to either abstain or even vote strategically against the outcome they would choose if the decision they would choose on their own. The extension endogenizes the acquisition of information by voters. The third part of the proposed research involves studying new voting mechanisms that allow voters to express preference intensities over a multiple decisions across different issue dimensions. We apply competitive equilibrium analysis to this kind of environment and propose a new equilibrium concept with vote trading, called ex ante exchange equilibrium. We then study the predictive power of this model by setting up controlled laboratory vote markets. The emphasis is on the comparative statics predictions and the efficiency properties. The two additional projects are: (4) The Emergence of Efficiency in Dynamic Coordination Problems; and (5) Dynamic Cursed Equilibrium with an Application to Sophisticated Voting in Dynamic Agendas with Incomplete Information. The analysis of the data will explore these extended models of limited rationality to help explain where and why the theory seems to be adequate and where and why it misses. Project (4) characterizes efficient dynamic equilibria subject to constraints imposed by the symmetry structure of the coordination game. We will design and conduct experiments that look at the effects of the number of players in the group and also the effects of the symmetry structure of the game. Project (5) explores a new specification of limited strategic sophistication that extends the cursed equilibrium to extensive form games. It extends the cursed equilibrium logic from traditional mixed strategies (strategic form) to behavioral strategies. The original formulation was done in strategic form and so the idea of cursed equilibrium did not have bite in many sequential contexts. We apply this to a variety of sequential games,<br/>in particular sequential voting with incomplete information. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: In addition to basic research, the proposed research has an education component, by training graduate students in experimental economics and economic theory. The ultimate goal of the research is to better understand how procedures in commitees affect decision making and with and eye to understanding how these procedures may be modified to improve decision making and overcome obstacles such as conflicting preferences and beliefs, and asymmetric information. This better understanding in the long run can improve performance of organizations and policy-making institutions. The performance of voting procedures are evaluated according to traditional economic welfare criteria, informational efficiency, and equity. There is extensive software development proposed under the grant. This software may be used freely by other researchers in experimental economics and will be publicly available as open source code.

For example, the embryo may be exposed to steroid hormones produced by the mother. In mammals, including humans, the placenta produces enzymes that metabolize, and render inactive, maternal steroids before they reach the developing embryo. Thus, the embryo is buffered from the potentially detrimental effects of maternal steroids. In species that lay eggs, embryos are exposed to maternal steroids present in the yolk when the egg is laid. This project examines how maternal steroids move from the yolk to the embryo in turtles. In addition, a variety of molecular and biochemical techniques will be employed to characterize how these maternal steroids are metabolized during embryonic development. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of how embryos regulate their endocrine environment. Importantly, many of the same metabolic enzymes examined in this proposal are also responsible for metabolizing exogenous chemicals such as plasticizers and pesticides. Characterizing these enzymes will enable researchers to investigate whether these foreign chemicals may disrupt steroid metabolism to produce detrimental effects. Compared to those from live-bearing species, embryos from egg-laying species provide a powerful system in which to study how various factors influence embryonic steroid metabolism because they develop outside of the maternal environment and can be readily manipulated. All experiments in this proposal will provide training opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate students, as well as a post-doctoral researcher.

The award supports work by Dr. Hang (Hubert) Yin at the University of Colorado at Boulder to carry out fundamental studies on understanding the molecular recognition in cellular membranes and to establish a solid foundation for an integrative chemical biology educational program in the Front Range region. Integral membrane proteins regulate pivotal biological processes through their transmembrane domains. But molecular recognition in the cellular membrane is little understood due to the lack of available probes with high affinity and specificity. Dr. Yin's group aims to develop a generally applicable method to probe molecular recognition in representative membrane protein systems (e.g. Escherichia coli aspartate receptor, Tar). The pedagogic activities involve establishing an infrastructure for a progressive, integrative chemical biology program that empowers diverse groups of students, researchers and educators. Collaboration with local high schools will be carried out, promoting chemical biology and biotechnology interest in the youth. Another major focus of our integrative research and education program is on promoting under-represented minority groups in science within the Boulder population. This work will positively impact scientific advancements and the local community by: (1) expanding the fundamental understanding of molecular recognition in cellular membranes; (2) shedding light on the poorly understood mechanisms of signal transduction across membranes, and (3) integrating research, teaching, and outreach activities at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
0961632	Collaborative Research: The impact of multiple nursery areas and adult age structure on the population dynamics of marine fishes	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	06/15/2010	04/23/2012	Thomas Miller	MD	University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences	Continuing grant	David L. Garrison	05/31/2014	$390,058.00		miller@cbl.umces.edu	BOX 775	Cambridge	MD	216130775	4102212014	GEO	1650	4444, 9169, EGCH	$0.00	Many marine populations exhibit complex life histories in which larval and juvenile stages are spatially separated from adults. This is the case for many coastal-spawning, estuarine-dependent fishes which utilize multiple estuaries as nursery grounds to ensure that recruitment failure in any single estuary does not translate to total recruitment failure at the population level. For these species, the location and timing of spawning is believed to regulate the pattern of supply of larvae to potential estuarine nursery areas. Furthermore, many of these species exhibit age-dependent coastal migrations which increase in amplitude with age. Thus, there is the potential that changes in the age structure in the population can affect the pattern of supply of larvae to nursery areas and structure the pattern of recruitment. The investigators will carry out an integrated empirical and simulation approach to study the sources, patterns and consequences of larval supply to estuarine nursery areas for Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) along the East Coast of the US. The first goal will be to quantify the contribution of these nursery areas to coast wide recruitment. Juvenile menhaden from nursery areas from Massachusetts to Georgia will be sampled and the microchemical constituents of their otoliths will be characterized. These chemical signatures will be used to assign the nursery affinities of adult menhaden in the coastwide population. The investigators will test the null hypothesis that the Chesapeake Bay remains the most important source of recruits to the population. By determining the nursery affinities of adults from different year classes in the population they will assess whether the contribution of nurseries varies or has shifted over time. The second goal is use a population model linked to an individual-based coupled physical-biological model of recruitment to evaluate whether the known age-dependent migrations of adult menhaden are sufficient to cause the observed shifts in the distribution of larval menhaden that seed potential nursery areas. The simulation model will assist in evaluating mechanisms behind observed changes in the distribution of juvenile menhaden.<br/><br/>This work will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the regulation of spatially-structured marine populations. The last decade has seen the range extension of several estuarine-dependent marine species with dispersive larvae and the long-term recruitment decline of others. This integrated research program seeks to explore the effects of population demography, oceanographic circulation, and nursery site diversity on subsequent population dynamics. Given the documented changes in habitat quality in many estuarine nursery areas, and the anticipated impacts of climate change on oceanographic circulation, distributional changes in individual species are likely to become more common. Moreover, given the pivotal role that many estuarine-dependent species play in many marine ecosystems, understanding distributional changes will have direct consequences for the structure and function of the ecosystems to which they belong. The project will also train young scientists in areas of research (quantitative fisheries ecology, physical oceanography) for which there is current a national need.
0964978	2010 Gordon Research Conference on Mutagenesis to be held August 1 through August 6, 2010, at Colby College in Waterville, Maine	MCB	Genetic Mechanisms	07/15/2010	06/28/2010	Nancy Maizels	RI	Gordon Research Conferences	Standard Grant	Susan Porter Ridley	06/30/2011	$5,000.00	Nancy Gray	maizels@u.washington.edu	512 Liberty Lane	West Kingston	RI	028921502	4017834011	BIO	1112	1116, 7465, 9183, BIOT, 1112	$0.00	The 2010 Mutagenesis Gordon Research Conference will address in molecular detail how mutations occur, how conserved pathways promote repair of such mutations, and how mutations can affect cellular processes. As the source of biological diversity, mutations enable subsets of organisms to survive despite changing conditions, and thus have been essential for life from its start. Mutagenesis drives the emergence of organisms which are better able to survive changing environmental conditions, but also promotes emergence of novel pathogens. Some mutations are spontaneous and inevitable, while others are induced by mutagens present in the environment either naturally or as a result of human negligence. Using experimental tools that span genetics, cell biology, biochemistry and structural biology, scientists have made dramatic progress in defining mechanisms of mutagenesis in recent years. Much of this progress has depended upon basic insights gained from experimentation with simpler microbial systems, especially the bacterium E. coli and the yeast S. cerevisiae. There is a growing understanding of how oxidative DNA damage, which may be an inevitable consequence of respiration, promotes mutations that contribute to genomic instability and aging; of how specific genomic sites and regions may be hotspots for mutagenesis; and of how regulated mutagenesis is essential to the pathogenesis of microorganisms and to the immune response. Mechanisms of mutagenesis and repair have proven to be highly conserved, and there has been continuous and fruitful interactions between investigators using a wise range of organisms and approaches. The 2010 Mutagenesis GRC will bring together a diverse group of scientists whose interests focus on mechanisms of mutagenesis and its consequences, in a format that promotes active discussion, presentation of new ideas, and development of collaborations that transcend disciplines and national boundaries. <br/><br/>The Mutagenesis Gordon Research Conference seeks to bring together leading investigators, both those who are established and those whose careers are still in their early stages, for a highly interactive meeting in a retreat-like environment. Participants will represent a wide range of research interests in areas including replication and repair fidelity, DNA modifications (both natural and synthetic), carcinogenesis, evolution and genetic toxicology. The chair of the 2010 meeting is a woman and it is anticipated that the speaker roster will be at least 25% women, with at least one Hispanic speaker. The organizers will strive to ensure that women, junior scientists (recently independent investigators, post-docs and graduate students) and underrepresented minorities are selected to attend the meeting, giving preference to such individuals when selecting meeting participants. The spectrum of topics and the breadth of expertise, perspectives, approaches and systems will set this meeting apart from more specialized conferences. This breadth, together with the intensity of a focused meeting with a limited number of participants, fosters the cross-fertilization of ideas and the collaborations that ultimately will lead to novel insights into mutagenic mechanisms and their results. The small size and unusually collegial and informal nature of the Mutagenesis Gordon Research Conference, along with its emphasis on discussion among investigators with diverse expertise, make it unique within the mutagenesis field. Through this meeting new collaborations will form and new knowledge will be disseminated. Funding from the National Science Foundation will help support the participation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and investigators whose careers are just getting underway.

Bensman	05/31/2014	$471,147.00		jim.steenburgh@utah.edu	75 S 2000 E	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	841128930	8015816903	GEO	1525	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	Orography has a dramatic influence on lake-effect snowstorms, not only in regions with major mountain barriers such as the Great Salt Lake Basin of northern Utah, but also in the eastern United States and Canada where more modest relief is found around the Great Lakes. For example, over the Tug Hill Plateau of northern New York, which lies downstream of Lake Ontario, annual snowfall increases 25-50 mm for every 100 m rise in elevation and storm-total accumulations have reached 360 cm in extreme lake-effect events. Orography also modifies the morphology of lake-effect snowstorms by altering the relationship between the large-scale flow and the development of precipitation structures such as broad-area precipitation shields and shoreline bands. Knowledge of lake-orographic precipitation processes is important not only for weather prediction, but also applications in hydrology, ecology, and geomorphology.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the project is to improve understanding of lake-orographic precipitation processes and their influence on the weather and climate of lake-effect regions. Key questions to be investigated include: <br/><br/>(1) to what extent does orography modify the morphology of lake-effect snowstorms, <br/>(2) which orographic processes and phenomena are responsible for these modifications, and <br/>(3) to what degree do lake-orographic precipitation processes contribute to the hydroclimate of lake effect regions? <br/><br/>These questions will be addressed in a three year research program that examines two regions where there are strong orographic influences on lake-effect precipitation. The first is the Great Salt Lake basin of northern Utah where the Wasatch Mountains and other ranges rise up to 2000 m above lake level. The second is the Tug Hill Plateau of northern New York, which provides a broad upland region 400-500 m above Lake Ontario. The research will produce a synthesis of results from a radar-based climatology, a field campaign, and numerical modeling.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: <br/>The research will advance knowledge and understanding of the physical processes that control lake-effect and orographic precipitation and, in turn, the influence of these processes on the hydrometeorology of lake-effect regions. Efforts to establish a relationship between the large-scale flow and lake-effect morphology have proven challenging, with previous workers specifically identifying the need to better understand the role of orography in altering structural transition zones. Project results will address this need.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>The project addresses the societal need to improve weather and climate prediction in lake-effect regions. Other broader impacts include:<br/><br/>(1) the infusion of research findings into undergraduate and graduate courses, training courses, and web-based educational modules, <br/>(2) the mentoring of two graduate students and the broadening of the participation of women in NSF-sponsored programs, and <br/>(3) the enhancement of public scientific understanding through collaborations with an NSF GK-12 graduate fellowship program that involve graduate student researchers in K-12 classrooms to teach discovery based environmental science in Salt Lake City school districts.<br/><br/>Further, this research program will likely engender broad scientific interest in other allied research communities such as hydrology, ecology, and geomorphology.

The ESP?s will be deployed together in an array configuration to obtain real-time data on a wide range of microorganisms and their metabolites. For many years, this has been a distant dream, but that dream is now close to reality with the development and commercialization of the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) that is the centerpiece of this proposal. The ESP can be deployed subsurface for months at a time. It collects and processes water samples, identifies and enumerates harmful algal bloom (HAB) species, pathogens, and other microorganisms as well as the concentration of specific metabolites such as algal toxins, and relays the data to shore. To foster greater flexibility, the ESP has been designed with a microfluidic block which allows analytical modules of different types (e.g., quantitative PCR) to be placed downstream of the water processing core. A wide variety of organisms and chemicals of interest to science and society can be analyzed over time scales that are not otherwise possible, all in automated fashion. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The potential broader impacts include: educational and outreach benefits from numerous undergraduates, graduate students, post docs, technical staff, and senior faculty working with the ESPs through various projects; various summer internship programs provided by WHOI and Biosecurity, Inc. for undergraduates including minority students; Monterey Bay Aquarium has included the ESP in a program that runs twice a day reaching almost 300,000 people a year; Volunteer phytoplankton researchers from 11 different states will be exposed to the ESP at various training workshops; scientifically, the placement of more ESP's into the ocean and eventually onto mobile platforms will give us the potential to inform and drive adaptive sampling in the way that CTD measurements do now; testing and establishing ESP technology will not only further the proposed research but also contribute to commercial interests that manufacture and sell advanced scientific instrumentation. As the technology is proven, other research groups will seek to incorporate it, and demand for the same or similar instruments will grow; many of the enabled/enhanced projects (research and educational) supported by this proposal are multi-investigator, and even multi-institutional, in nature and would further increase networking and partnering among relevant research groups.

However, creating powerful Web applications is a difficult task and current development tools exacerbate the problems with a low-level approach that discourages modularity and code reuse. This project is exploring a new architecture for Web application development, where applications are created by assembling high-level reusable components rather than building from scratch. A component architecture can dramatically simplify the development of interactive Web applications by encouraging reusability and by hiding inside the components many of the complexities that bedevil Web developers today. This project is exploring three aspects of component architectures: new abstractions for higher-level Web components, including layout management; abstractions for layering data management components to simplify transformations, business rules, and aggregation; and the application of component architectures to mobile devices in order to manage differences in device form factors. We are exploring design choices, creating production-quality implementations for both framework elements and specific components, and evaluating the implementations. In addition, we are releasing the framework in open-source form for others to use. Overall, this project will increase our understanding of component-based architectures and Web application development.
0969033	CSEDI: Thermal conductivity of lower mantle minerals and heat flow across the core/mantle boundary	EAR	STUDIES OF THE EARTHS DEEP INT, ICER	06/01/2010	01/17/2014	Abby Kavner	CA	University of California-Los Angeles	Standard Grant	Robin Reichlin	05/31/2014	$346,012.00	Laurent Pilon	akavner@ucla.edu	10889 Wilshire Boulevard	LOS ANGELES	CA	900951406	3107940102	GEO	1585, 7699	0000, 1031, 7969, OTHR	$0.00	The heat flow across the Earth's core-mantle boundary controls the thermal evolution of the whole Earth, which is ultimately expressed on the surface by plate tectonics. However the thermal properties of the core/mantle boundary are not well known, leading to significant uncertainties in our understanding of the temperature and heat profile of the Earth - both currently and in the past. The goal of this proposal is to determine the thermal properties -especially thermal conductivity- of the Earth's mantle, through a combination of experiment and modeling. This information will be used to help constrain the temperature profile throughout the Earth's interior, the style of mantle convection, and the timing for the growth of the inner core. <br/><br/>We will combine methods from theoretical and experimental mineral physics and heat flow modeling in crystalline bulk and in composite materials to measure the thermal conductivity of the deep Earth. Starting with a data set describing the lattice thermal conductivity of MgO and MgSiO3 at deep mantle conditions, we will measure how the presence and behavior of iron changes those values at high pressures and temperatures. The experimental data will be interpreted with help from computational models of heat flow in the laser-heated diamond cell, used to make these measurements. Finally, we examine the implications for the mantle using a heat flow model for composite materials and including both conduction and radiation. The overall outcome will be an estimate of the thermal conductivity of the lower mantle at core/mantle boundary conditions, and how the thermal conductivity varies with pressure, temperature, and composition. <br/><br/>This project brings together two scientists from very different disciplines: a mechanical engineer with expertise in heat transfer and a geophyscist with expertise in measurements of physical properties under extreme conditions. This interdisciplinary project will support the training of a graduate student for three years. In addition, this project will support summer research for undergraduates at UCLA. Measurements of thermal properties of materials under extreme conditions are important not only for Earth & planetary science, but also for engineering, materials science, and physics. Both researchers are actively involved in science education and outreach at all levels, and have active research groups including undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars.
0968823	Collaborative Research: CSEDI--Grand Challenge for Experimental Study of Plastic Deformation Under Deep Earth Conditions	EAR	GEOPHYSICS, INSTRUMENTATION & FACILITIES, STUDIES OF THE EARTHS DEEP INT	07/01/2010	06/29/2012	Donald Weidner	NY	SUNY at Stony Brook	Continuing grant	Robin Reichlin	06/30/2014	$599,979.00	Li Li	donald.weidner@sunysb.edu	WEST 5510 FRK MEL LIB	Stony Brook	NY	117940001	6316329949	GEO	1574, 1580, 1585	0000, 1031	$0.00	The main goal of this joint project is to further develop the experimental techniques of studying plastic deformation under deep Earth conditions. When a large force (stress) is applied to minerals or rocks under shallow Earth conditions, they will be deformed by brittle fracture. In the deep interior of Earth, temperature is higher and then plastic deformation becomes possible. This plastic deformation helps material circulation by convection that cools Earth and causes most of geological activities including mountain building and deep circulation of water and other materials. However, to date very little is known on the plastic flow properties of materials under deep Earth conditions due mainly to the technical difficulties. For example, in the deep interior of Earth, not only is temperature high, but also pressure is high. Usually pressure suppresses atomic motion and hence plastic deformation becomes difficult under high-pressure conditions. Does the role of pressure become more important than temperature and hence the viscosity of materials increases with depth? Also most of minerals undergo a series of phase transformations. How do these phase transformations affect the plastic properties? These issues are critical to our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of Earth and other terrestrial planets. <br/><br/>Despite its importance, almost nothing was known about these deep earth deformation as recently as ~ten years ago. Recognizing this need, the investigators started a group effort to develop new techniques of plastic deformation under deep Earth conditions in 2002. Based on the studies during the previous funding periods, they have made major progress including the development of new types of deformation apparatus and the improvements to the stress (and strain) measurements using synchrotron x-ray sources. As a result, we can now conduct quantitative deformation experiments to ~20 GPa and ~2000 K. However, these conditions correspond only to the depth of ~500 km. Earth's mantle extends to ~2900 km. Also, there has been very poor control of water content in materials previously studied. In this new phase of technical development, the team of investigators will focus on (i) extending the maximum pressure to ~30 GPa and higher (~1000 km depth), (ii) improving the control of chemical environment (such as water fugacity) under high-pressure conditions, and (iii) improving the stress measurements through the use of new hardware and theory. These developments will allow investigation of the plastic properties of Earth materials to the conditions equivalent to the shallow part of the lower mantle under well-controlled chemical environment. Applications of these techniques will shed important new light into our understanding of dynamics of whole Earth. The project is a collaboration among teams at four institutions, and will provide enhanced infrastructure to the experimental geophysics community, including new facilities at national synchrotron beamlines that will be available to the broader community. The developments will include training and mentoring of graduate students and post doctoral scholars.

An organizationally-adept agent is not only aware of its role(s) in an organization, but can also monitor how well it is fulfilling its organizational responsibilities and can proactively adapt its behaviors to meet organizational needs better. Organizationally adept agents evaluate their behaviors based not on their (agent-centric) self-interests but rather on their (organization-centric) responsibilities to each other, and autonomously adapt to achieve organizational objectives emergently.<br/><br/>Elaboration and adaptation by organizationally adept agents means that the ultimate organization design is formed by a combination of top-down design (to produce a ballpark organization) and emergent refinement processes. Further, this combination can be iterative and ongoing, where organizationally adept agents can detect tension between top-down and emergent influences, and inform the design processes of runtime interaction patterns and environmental tendencies that suggest useful top-down organization restructurings.<br/><br/>The intellectual problems being pursued are central to practical issues in scaling multi-agent systems to help solve complex, long-term, global problems. Many critical challenges facing society including climate change, health care, and sustainable energy|require a prolonged commitment to monitoring and managing distributed activities. Networked computer systems populated by software agents, which can be constantly measuring, comparing, and interpreting information to understand and respond to wide-scale phenomena, promise to address such challenges, but need the kinds of innovations proposed in this project. Second, while the project is specifically looking at organizations for computational agents, our results will inform, and be informed by, research on human organizations. To stimulate sharing insights and results, the investigators will organize a multi-disciplinary symposium on organization-centric reasoning, and will train an inter-disciplinary cohort of graduate students.
0944686	Collaborative Research: Ecophysiology of DMSP and related compounds and their contributions to carbon and sulfur dynamics in Phaeocystis antarctica	PLR	ANTARCTIC ORGANISMS & ECOSYST	06/01/2010	06/25/2012	David Kieber	NY	SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry	Continuing grant	Charles Amsler	05/31/2014	$360,347.00		djkieber@esf.edu	PO Box 9	Albany	NY	122010009	3154706606	GEO	5111	7969, 	$0.00	Abstract<br/><br/>Spectacular blooms of Phaeocystis antarctica in the Ross Sea, Antarctica are the source of some of the world's highest concentrations of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and its volatile degradation product, dimethylsulfide (DMS). The flux of DMS from the oceans to the atmosphere in this region and its subsequent gas phase oxidation generates aerosols that have a strong influence on cloud properties and possibly climate. In the oceans, DMS and DMSP are quantitatively significant components of the carbon, sulfur, and energy flows in marine food webs, especially in the Ross Sea. Despite its central role in carbon and sulfur biogeochemistry in the Ross Sea, surprisingly little is known about the physiological functions of DMSP in P. Antarctica. The research will isolate and characterize DMSP lyases from P. antarctica, with the goal of obtaining amino acid and gene sequence information on these important enzymes. The physiological studies will focus on the effects of varying intensities of photosynthetically active radiation, with and without ultraviolet radiation as these are factors that we have found to be important controls on DMSP and DMS dynamics. The research also will examine the effects of prolonged darkness on the dynamics of DMSP and related compounds in P. antarctica, as survival of this species during the dark Antarctic winter and at sub-euphotic depths appears to be an important part of the Phaeocystis? ecology. A unique aspect of this work is the focus on measurements of intracellular MSA, which if detected, would provide strong evidence for in vivo radical scavenging functions for methyl sulfur compounds. The study will advance understanding of what controls DMSP cycling and ultimately DMS emissions from the Ross Sea and also provide information on what makes P. antarctica so successful in this extreme environment. The research will directly benefit and build on several interrelated ocean-atmosphere programs including the International Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) program. The PIs will participate in several activities involving K-12 education, High School teacher training, public education and podcasting through the auspices of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab Discovery Hall program and SUNY ESF. Two graduate students will be employed full time, and six undergraduates (2 each summer) will be trained as part of this project.

To accomplish this goal the PIs will develop a detailed geochronology and analyze Hf- and O-isotopes of detrital zircons in sandstones of the Devonian Taylor Group and the Permian-Triassic Victoria Group. These data will allow them to better determine provenance and basin fill, and to understand the nature of the now ice covered source regions in East and West Antarctica. The PIs will document possible unexposed/unknown crustal terrains in West Antarctica, investigate sub-glacial terrains of East Antarctica that were exposed to erosion during Devonian to Triassic time, and determine the evolving provenance and tectonic history of the Devonian to Triassic Gondwana basins in the central Transantarctic Mountains. Detrital zircon data will be interpreted in the context of fluvial dispersal/drainage patterns, sandstone petrology, and sequence stratigraphy. This interpretation will identify source terrains and evolving sediment provenances. Paleocurrent analysis and sequence stratigraphy will determine the timing and nature of changing tectonic conditions associated with development of the depositional basins and document the tectonic history of the Antarctic sector of Gondwana. Results from this study will answer questions about the Panthalassan margin of Gondwana, the Antarctic craton, and the Beacon depositional basin and their respective roles in global tectonics and the geologic and biotic history of Antarctica. The Beacon basin and adjacent uplands played an important role in the development and demise of Gondwanan glaciation through modification of polar climates, development of peat-forming mires, colonization of the landscape by plants, and were a migration route for Mesozoic vertebrates into Antarctica. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>This proposal includes support for two graduate students who will participate in the fieldwork, and also support for other students to participate in laboratory studies. Results of the research will be incorporated in classroom teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels and will help train the next generation of field geologists. Interactions with K-12 science classes will be achieved by video/computer conferencing and satellite phone connections from Antarctica. Another outreach effort is the developing cooperation between the Byrd Polar Research Center and the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus.

These models are converging on predictions about climate changes that are likely to occur in coming decades. Such changes are certain to provoke human responses and many commentators have suggested what those responses are likely to be in particular parts of the world. Nevertheless, human populations are complex systems in which changes in one part of the system can have significant consequences for other, perhaps quite remote, parts of the system - meaning that human responses to climate change must also be studied as processes in a complex system involving, potentially at least, all human societies. To date, however, the social sciences have not produced models of large scale human population systems that integrate predictions from climate models. One reason for this neglect may be that such work requires knowledge not only of the basic principles of human behavior and the techniques for modeling it, but also of (1) current climate models; (2) geographic information systems (GIS) which provide a means for organizing geographic data worldwide, including human population data; (3) statistical techniques for analyzing the large amounts of data produced from population simulations; and (4) actual human responses to climate changes both in the recent past (e.g., Darfur) and in the more remote past (e.g., ancient Maya). Accordingly, the present project includes two political scientists with background in behavioral modeling; a climatologist who has worked extensively on climate modeling; an expert in geographic information systems; an expert in applied mathematics and statistics; and an archaeologist. Initial steps toward the behavioral model will be tested against known cases of climate change in the recent past (e.g. Darfur) and the more remote past (e.g., the Mayan collapse). To the extent predictions from the developing model do not match known human responses in such cases, its parameters will be adjusted - and, subsequently, tested against further such cases. <br/><br/>Archaeological evidence shows that climate change has undermined many civilizations in the past but also that the climate changes per se were often less damaging than the human responses to those changes - including mass migration and armed conflict. In the interdependent modern world, human responses to climate changes have the potential to ripple well beyond an immediately affected area, and responses to such changes in different and perhaps quite remote areas might interact in negative ways. Thus, well developed models of likely human responses to expected climate changes - including abrupt changes - will allow policy makers to anticipate not only local consequences of local climate changes, but also geographically perhaps quite remote consequences. The project takes initial steps toward more fully developed models of human responses to climate change, just as early climate models can now be seen as initial steps toward the more fully developed climate models that presently exist.

Current trends suggest that cores will be relatively simple, that on-chip memory will be partitioned into per-core caches, and that each cache will be relatively small. Furthermore, chips will continue to be pin-limited and therefore DRAM bandwidth won't scale with the number of cores.<br/><br/>Parallel software that is data intensive has the potential to run well on multicore processors due to the large total amount of on-chip cache, but requires effective use of the distributed on-chip caches. The dangers are that data used by many cores will be duplicated in many cores' caches, decreasing the total amount of distinct data that can be cached; and that some cores may incur DRAM loads trying to access more data than fits in their caches, while other cores have spare cache space.<br/><br/>As the number of cores per DRAM interface and the latencies between caches on a chip increase, it is important for software to manage the distributed caches well. A collaborative approach that involves architects and systems researchers to extend the memory interface to provide control over data placement and enable on-chip efficient data movement provides a holistic solution. Specifically, this work proposes data-movement control (DMC) interface, which includes support for cache-to-cache transfers, batching of several cache lines, sending a message to a core that is close to a cache that holds a particular data item, and data monitoring. The proposal also includes techniques to route data over the interconnect that will provide high performance for the DMC interface.<br/><br/>If successful, DMC will help data-intensive applications avoid memory bottlenecks and allow them to run well on future multicore processors. A full-system simulator will allow other researchers to explore intelligent and efficient data management and enable research projects in MIT's graduate computer architecture class, educating students about the challenges of multicore computing.
0964088	Investigating the Structure of Tornadoes and the Near-tornado Environment Using Mobile High-frequency Ka-band Doppler Radar Technology	AGS	PHYSICAL & DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY	07/01/2010	06/10/2012	Christopher Weiss	TX	Texas Tech University	Continuing grant	Edward L. Bensman	06/30/2015	$355,344.00		chris.weiss@ttu.edu	349 Administration Bldg	Lubbock	TX	794091035	8067423884	GEO	1525	0000, OTHR, 1525	$0.00	The intellectual merit of this study will be in the introduction of high frequency mobile Doppler radar technology to the VORTEX 2 field program. This is a large field program entering its second field operations period in May-June 2010 involving multiple mobile platforms focused on the study of tornadic thunderstorms in the upper Great Plains region. This contribution to the field program will involve two Texas Tech University Ka-band (35 GHz) (TTUKa) radars. Observations with these radars will be used to address many VORTEX 2 objectives related to better understanding the nature of circulations in the near-tornado environment, in tornado cyclones, and in sub-tornado-scale vortices. Owing to the use of non-linear pulse compression, a first for mobile high-frequency radar, these radar systems feature higher sensitivity than other such radars. The fine angular resolution and high sensitivity of the TTUKa radars will provide previously unresolved detail and coverage of air motions at the tornado scale. Two primary observational objectives are (1) horizontal and vertical structure of tornado vortices, and (2) pre-existing vertical vorticity maxima prior to tornadogenesis. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the study will be manifested in several ways. Graduate and undergraduate students will be heavily utilized in the planning and execution of TTUKa data collection and the presentation of preliminary results at mission briefings. Some of these students have a background in fields other than meteorology (e.g., civil engineering, wind engineering, mathematics), and therefore have the opportunity to expand their knowledge base. Given the typical ethnic diversity of the student population at Texas Tech University, traditionally underrepresented groups will have the opportunity to contribute to the project, particularly those of Hispanic descent.<br/><br/>One ultimate goal of the proposed research is the improved understanding of tornado vortex structure, leading to advancement in understanding of hazards due to tornados. Another objective of the research is to improve tornado forecasts through the recognition of the influence of detectable variability in the pre-tornadic supercell environment on subsequent storm evolution. This increase in forecast skill is vital for the protection of life and property. Through the broad dissemination of research results in journal publications and conference presentations, all research objectives that are met will have significant impact in the community.

Birchler (University of Missouri - Columbia), Jiming Jiang (University of Wisconsin - Madison), Gernot Presting (University of Hawaii - Manoa), and Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra (University of California - Davis)<br/><br/>Centromeres are regions of the genome that organize and regulate chromosome movement. They are key elements in the development of next-generation artificial chromosomes for introducing new traits into crop plants. Yet the biology of centromeres remains poorly understood. The experiments carried out in this project will complete the sequence and assembly of maize centromeres, address known epigenetic limitations associated with employing artificial chromosomes, develop improved strategies for streamlining centromere study and use, and document the diversity of centromeres in maize and allied species. <br/><br/>To expand training opportunities in plant genetics, two programs will be initiated. One will provide hands-on training in plant cytogenetics through an Annual Cytogenetics Workshop to be held at the University of Wisconsin. The second will be an international student exchange program between project laboratories and the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Specifically, thirteen students will be funded to travel between universities and work on collaborative projects relating to centromere evolution and function. A web site (www.plantcentromeres.org) will be used to disseminate results from the project and to coordinate outreach activities. In addition, sequence data will be deposited at MaizeGDB (www.maizegdb.org) and GenBank. Germplasm generated will be deposited at the Iowa North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station (Ames, IA).

The thousands of vital chemical reactions that allow life are catalyzed by enzymes. Despite being studied systematically for more than a century, it is still not clear how enzymes accelerate chemical reactions. Enzymology has delved deeply into uncovering the mechanism of catalysis in biology and now attempts to understand reactivity in terms of macromolecular structure and in the dynamic motions of macromolecules. Structures and their movements promote some chemically complex, biologically critical reactions. Just as important, these same structures prevent deleterious side-reactions. The elegant tuning of enzyme reactivity is the result of evolution under selective pressure. Changing environments, or changing metabolic imperatives, cause new enzyme activities to evolve. The task of understanding how enzymes catalyze reactions, how their activity is controlled, and how new activities can emerge requires insight from many perspectives. This Gordon Conference on Enzymes, Coenzymes and Metabolic Pathways will provide a highly interactive venue to present discuss and debate the cutting-edge of enzyme research.<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Enzymes, Coenzymes and Metabolic Pathways is now one of the most influential in the broad area of enzymology. It gathers the leaders in the field, trainees at the student or postdoctoral level, and those in between. The collegial, informal atmosphere, coupled to the GRC non-disclosure policy, is extremely effective in fostering the free exchange of ideas and cutting-edge results. The Enzymes GRC has truly been the birthplace of many fruitful collaborations and new research directions. The Enzymes GRC has also been a very effective mechanism for incorporating women and underrepresented minorities into enzymology and the metabolic pathway community. The event allows participants to build invaluable networks with leaders in the field from academia, industry, and government. This year's conference continues this tradition of inclusiveness, with a very high proportion of speakers and discussion leaders being women and underrepresented minorities. The conference also provides important networking opportunities and intellectual development for graduate students and postdoctoral associated, and, therefore, helps to sustain the field by developing new talent.

The flow of water masses between the Bering Sea and the Arctic and Pacific oceans, changes in Arctic ice volume, and whether dense intermediate waters formed in the Pacific during this time will be investigated as some of the possible triggers of past climate change. The high resolution sediment records obtained from this cruise, with relatively large-amplitude signals, provide a unique opportunity to understand how insulation changes in the upper atmosphere propagate through the climate system and to further test if the orbital cycles of climate change primarily operate on 23ky versus 40 ky timescales. This study utilizes K % logging data from the cruise with paleomagnetic, sedimentological (eg., grain size analysis) and paleontological (eg., analysis of microfossil assemblages; d18O and d13C measurements of benthic and planktonic forams) measurements from the drill cores. The information expected from this study is critical for understanding the fundamental drivers and feedbacks between ice sheets, oceanic and atmospheric circulation and the global carbon cycle. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project significantly advances large investments previously made in an important IODP expedition. The data derived from this investigation can provide important information for paleoclimate/ocean models, and is relevant towards projections of future climate under IPCC AR4 scenarios. The project includes a team of early and mid-career scientists, and includes international collaborations with other scientists of the IODP community. Support is also provided for undergraduate and graduate education, and for public outreach and education.
0961735	Globalization, Trade, and the Task Content of U.S. Employment	BCS	GEOGRAPHY AND SPATIAL SCIENCES	06/15/2010	05/27/2011	David Rigby	CA	University of California-Los Angeles	Continuing grant	Thomas J. Baerwald	05/31/2013	$214,870.00	Thomas Kemeny	rigby@geog.ucla.edu	10889 Wilshire Boulevard	LOS ANGELES	CA	900951406	3107940102	SBE	1352	1352	$0.00	The structure of the global economy currently is being transformed in ways that will have profound implications for the location of production, the nature of work, and economic well-being around the world. Early stages of globalization were characterized by the international exchange of final products, whether port for wheat or automobiles for apparel, resulting in a spatial division of labor that was sorted by industry. In contrast, the current round of globalization is separating production tasks once integrated within firms and industries, shifting them to locations around the world. To understand the implications of this shift for the U.S. economy, greater understanding is needed about tasks that can be offshored and which are likely to remain place-bound. The objective of this research project is to measure how trade has impacted the task structure of the U.S. economy. While theoretical models of task trade have recently been developed, empirical exploration has been severely limited by lack of appropriate data. The investigators will create a unique dataset suited to measuring the impact of task trade by linking detailed U.S. Census microdata that describe trade flows, firms, workers and the tasks in which they are engaged. These data will enable the researchers to explore three primary questions: (1) What is the impact of trade on the task structure of the U.S. economy? (2) How is trade-induced job loss related to the analytic and interpersonal complexity of occupations? (3) How has the subnational geography of tasks shifted in the U.S. economy over the last fifteen years, and how are these shifts related to the regional impacts of trade and the characteristics of local production systems?<br/><br/>In today's highly interconnected world, patterns of trade are closely linked to economic performance and the geography of work. This project will improve scientific knowledge regarding the transformation of the global system of trade from one premised on exchanges of final goods to one focused on the exchange of a rapidly increasing array of intermediate goods and services. The project will measure the impact of the changing nature of trade on the structure of work in the U.S. economy and the differential effect of that change across U.S. regions. The results of this project will help to identify the nature of jobs that are robust to trade competition and those footloose activities that are likely to be increasingly located offshore. The project also will contribute to ongoing debates in fields like education and labor economics regarding the preparation required for 21st century workers in advanced economies.

Poe Rd.	Bowling Green	OH	434030230	4193722481	GEO	5112	0000, OTHR	$0.00	ntellectual Merit: <br/>This proposal is for a combined geochronologic, petrographic, geochemical, and Sr-Nd-Pb-Os-O isotopic investigation of existing lava samples from the seamounts in the Adare Basin and from the adjacent continental Hallett Volcanic Province in Northern Victoria Land. A comparative study of contemporaneous intraplate oceanic and continental alkaline volcanism will be used to evaluate sources and processes responsible for magma production and differentiation. The seamount lavas will provide an opportunity to better characterize the composition of their underlying mantle source whereas the continental lavas will provide information on any effects of contamination by continental crust on their source signatures. The cause of Cenozoic magmatism in West Antarctica has been explained by a variety of models based primarily on geochemical evidence from continental volcanism. The proposed investigation will for the first time provide detailed geochronologic and geochemical data for both continental lavas and adjacent oceanic seamount lavas, thus offering a means by which to critically assess whether Cenozoic alkaline volcanism is due to plume or plume-related activities or magmatism unrelated to mantle plumes. The classic element of this controversy is whether the geochemistry of the magmas represents melting of mantle asthenosphere or subcontinental lithosphere and whether there is a degree of contamination as they rise through relatively thick and chemically heterogeneous continental crust. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>This project will support a PhD and MSc student. Undergraduate students will also be involved in sample preparation, analytical work and interpretation via honors/senior theses. A post-doctoral associate will be involved in the oxygen isotopic analysis of the samples. The students will be involved in a multi-institutional and international collaboration. The geochemical database generated will be made available to other researchers in the region and the results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.
0960777	Collaborative Research: The Political Economy of Localized Communal Conflicts in Ethiopia	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	08/01/2010	06/22/2010	Lahra Smith	DC	Georgetown University	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	07/31/2014	$92,483.00		ls356@georgetown.edu	37th & O St N W	Washington	DC	200571789	2026250100	SBE	1371		$0.00	Under what conditions does violence erupt in multiethnic communities? Why does conflict break out between groups in some communities but not in others? Such questions are investigated through a study of communal conflicts in Ethiopia, a poor country where local order often breaks down as neighboring groups take up arms to resolve their disputes. By examining patterns of conflict at the district level, this research project aims to explain how institutions of local governance influence tensions produced by social divides and resource scarcity. Specifically, this study examines to what extent the outbreak of violence depends on the representation of different groups in district-level administration and the intensity of weather-related shocks to local crop production or animal rearing.<br/><br/>Ethiopia provides an ideal context for studying how communal conflicts arise through the interaction between institutions, identities, and resources. While the country's districts vary considerably in levels of ethnic diversity and land productivity, decentralizing reforms adopted in the past 15 years have empowered all districts to make decisions over budget expenditures, land use, and agricultural inputs. The distribution of district resources may not affect the welfare of citizens during normal times, but a district's authority over land and water use becomes a critical issue during the prolonged periods of scarcity often confronted in a country that depends on rain-fed agriculture. Whether local groups monopolize or share control of district administration could therefore influence the outbreak of violence between them.<br/><br/>To assess the causes of communal conflict in Ethiopia, this project will develop a dataset of conflicts found in all districts and undertake ethnographic studies of two selected districts over a two-year period. First, the project will draw on government and non-government sources of information to assemble a dataset of local conflicts across Ethiopia's 550 districts between 1995 and 2006. The district-level data will allow for a statistical analysis that tests whether the outbreak of violence can be attributed to institutional, demographic, or economic factors. Second, the project will use the district-level dataset to identify two districts for in-depth ethnographic study. Interviews and focus groups will be organized with members of selected communities to establish how, in practice, administrative authority, demographic pressures, and resource constraints heighten fear or competition between groups. These ethnographic studies will further help to establish how episodes of communal conflict are understood in their local socio-cultural context, overwhelming traditional mechanisms of dispute resolution and possibly creating cycles of recurrent violence. <br/><br/>This project is relevant to the stability of countries in Africa and other developing regions, which share many of Ethiopia's economic and political characteristics. Its research will directly address the impact of decentralizing reforms, which are often promoted as an institutional solution to the competition over resources in multiethnic countries. Yet, it remains to be shown how decentralization affects the outbreak of violence between groups, particularly when those reforms can bring about a realignment of power at the local level. This project's findings will provide a better understanding of how institutional changes interact with demographic and resource pressures in fragile states. The lessons derived from this research will permit scholars and policymakers to craft institutional reforms better suited to preventing communal conflicts that often degenerate into complex humanitarian crises.

Mixing by internal waves is thought to be a primary mechanism governing the overall thermohaline structure of the oceans, and may have significant implications for climate variability. The project promises to reduce the uncertainty in climate prediction associated with the smallest scale physical processes that cannot be explicitly solved by climate models. The project will address three aspects of ocean mixing: near field mixing at internal wave generation sites, mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy transported in the wave field, and far field mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy away from sources. Parameterizations will be based on data-based relations for wave physics, radiation balance theory, and results from process models. In addition to be being based on sound theoretical ideas, the parameterizations will also be based on observational results from the growing data set of microstructure observations.

The creation of accessible problem sets and and lecture notes is time intensive, but methods courses requiring such preparation are becoming more widespread across all types of institutions. OPOSSEM, the Online Portal of Social Science Education and Methodology, solves these problems by providing various resources for teaching social science research methods for edcuators in secondary, undergraduate, and postgraduate settings. The web portal is hosted by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), which provides for its long term longevity.<br/><br/>This project, which develops this portal, has substantial intellectual merit. It has the potential to transform methodological instruction in the social sciences by adopting cutting edge and broadly available technologies and methodologies to promote the formation of educational networks and communities among secondary, undergraduate, and graduate instructors. <br/><br/>This project also has substantial broader impacts. First, project materials will be used as part of a pilot project by Native American students at the Ihanktowan Community College on the Yankton Sioux Tribe Reservation. These students will be provided with resources through this project that may encourage them to consider the social sciences as a major or graduate pursuit. Second, the portal will provide resources that will strengthen undergraduate training in the social sciences. This will result in the pool of potential graduate students in these fields to be better prepared to undertake graduate study. Third and finally, the project reaches out to secondary school teachers in both the social sciences and the mathematical sciences. Many mathematically oriented high school students lean to the natural sciences because they see applications to those sciences in their math and science textbooks. Some of these students may be encouraged to consider the social sciences if they are exposed to similar examples in those sciences. The portal will make this more likely.

Courts are said to be especially dependent on public trust as they lack purse and sword to enforce their orders. This study will focus on one political theory known as descriptive representation, which posits that institutions enhance their political legitimacy by reflecting the gender, ethnic and racial make-up of the American population. Such institutional diversity not only helps realize the ideals of popular sovereignty, but also sends an important message to historically underrepresented groups that they are welcome in the halls of power. Given the spate of criticism of the Judiciary in recent years, the enhancement of the courts? political legitimacy has never been more timely and important. Accordingly, the research question at issue in this project is: how does increased diversity on the federal bench impacts citizens? views about the legitimacy of U.S. courts?<br/><br/>An innovative research design will be used for this project ? a series of experiments using a national random sample of subjects and conducted on the internet. Experiments have a critical advantage over traditional surveys, for they establish causation, and not mere correlation. The data collected for this survey will enable a wide array of researchers in the social sciences, the legal academy, and the federal government to better understand the relationship between race/gender and institutional legitimacy. The data will prove especially useful to scholars of Congress, the bureaucracy, the presidency, race and gender politics, and public opinion ? many of whom are engaged with questions about the changing demography in the U.S., and its impact on American politics. With the election of the first African American president, diversity in our government has never been more salient an issue.

Of special interest are polarimetric measurements made in supercells combined with rapid-scan (i.e., rapidly repeated) volumetric radar descriptions of tornadic supercells. The former will provide 3-D descriptions of hydrometeor distributions in these storms, which are necessary for a full understanding of storm thermodynamics and dynamics while the latter will illuminate rapidly evolving and recurrent storm features. Tandem numerical experiments will ingest these measurements into a state-of-the-art cloud model in order to obtain improved estimates of atmospheric variables not directly measured by radar (such as air temperature, moisture content and vertical velocity within storm updrafts/downdrafts). This project will also support collection and analysis of data from the first rapid-scan polarimetric X-band mobile Doppler radar utilized in the study of severe thunderstorms, whose development was previously supported by NSF.<br/><br/>The Intellectual Merit of this work derives from obtaining a more complete understanding of severe thunderstorms, the tornadoes they produce, and detailed dynamical relationships between the two.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts will be immediately realized through training of graduate students involved in data collection and analysis, and through the PI's involvement in undergraduate education and dissemination of result both through formal publications and various media outlets. Ultimately, this work may have societal benefits through improved numerical forecasts and more timely public warnings. Benefits will also accrue through critical evaluation and resulting improvement of cutting-edge mobile radar technologies.
0951802	Collaborative Proposal; Environment, Society, and Economy: Modeling New Behaviors Emerging from Coupling Physical Coastal Processes and Coastal Economies	EAR	DECISION RISK & MANAGEMENT SCI, GEOMORPHOLOGY & LAND USE DYNAM, ENV., SOCIETY AND THE ECONOMY	07/01/2010	06/24/2010	Brad Murray	NC	Duke University	Standard Grant	Richard Yuretich	06/30/2014	$460,036.00	Martin Smith	abmurray@duke.edu	2200 W.

In turn, the processes that shape landscapes affect humans, often posing natural hazards. In coastal environments these two-way interactions involve coastal erosion, which threatens coastal communities, and shoreline-stabilization efforts, which affect the evolution of the surrounding coastline. Previous numerical modeling has shown that localized shoreline stabilization efforts, such as nourishing beaches by adding sand, can alter shoreline erosion rates even in distant parts of a coastline. Thus, a coastal community that chooses to stabilize its shoreline inadvertently affects other communities, so that the economies and management of coastal communities are linked. This research will use numerical modeling to address the kinds of coupled environmental and economic patterns that emerge under different decision-making regimes. An economic component to the numerical modeling, based on an empirical relationship between property values and beach width, determines the beach replenishment strategy that optimizes the net benefits to an individual community. Coupling this model to a coastline-change model reveals the unexpected ways that communities unwittingly interact with one another, and the feedbacks that induce some communities to shoulder more of the shoreline stabilization effort than others. In contrast, a different economic-model approach will analyze what pattern of beach replenishment would maximize the net benefits of a stretch of coastline more holistically. This project will investigate the different patterns of coastline change and economic benefits these approaches would produce under different scenarios for: 1) sea-level rise; 2) changing storm climate; 3) coastline physical and economic attributes; and 4) diminishing common-pool sand resources and the associated increase in the price of beach replenishment. <br/><br/>Changes in coastal environments can no longer be understood by considering either physical or economic processes in isolation; this research provides a necessary step toward understanding the dynamics of developed coastlines?what causes the patterns of shoreline erosion and economic impacts under various possible futures (given uncertainties in climate change and economic driving factors including sand resources). The results of computer-model experiments testing how coordinated planning for shoreline stabilization could increase net wealth will not only increase basic knowledge about how coupled human/landscape systems work, but it could lead to improvements in coastal management strategies.

Significant variability exists in U isotope composition, due largely to isotope fractionation during redox transformations of U in solution. This suggests that the U isotope composition of seawater may be determined by the redox state of the global ocean. This research will involve laboratory experiments to determine whether U isotopes fractionate during abiotic precipitation of calcite and aragonite, which will serve as a baseline against which to compare any biogenic fractionation. A field component will investigate fractionation of U isotopes in natural carbonates, both biogenic and abiotic. This will include study of how low temperature alteration during deposition and burial might affect the preservation of the primary U isotope signal. Funding provides research opportunities for undergraduates from the Arizona State University Honors College, and supports a PhD thesis.

Be they modules, spaces, motives or <br/>C*-algebras, objects are usually too wild to be classified up to <br/>isomorphism. However, one can always classify classes of objects stable <br/>under the basic constructions which are: suspension, cone and tensor <br/>product (such classes are known as thick tensor-ideals). This <br/>classification is made by means of subsets of a certain topological <br/>space, constructed by the PI and called the triangular spectrum. This <br/>space has been computed in stable homotopy theory, algebraic geometry <br/>and modular representation theory, using the work of Hopkins-Smith, <br/>Neeman-Thomason, Benson-Carlson-Rickard and Friedlander-Pevtsova. <br/>Computing the triangular spectrum in noncommutative topology <br/>(equivariant KK-theory) or in motivic examples is a major ongoing <br/>project where progress has recently been made. The broader ambition of <br/>tensor triangular geometry is that of building brides across some parts <br/>of mathematics as follows: Identify the concepts, results and techniques <br/>from any area covered by tensor triangular geometry which can be <br/>abstracted and consequently applied to all other areas under the <br/>umbrella. Recent activity has exhibited numerous such phenomenons, in <br/>the PI's work and beyond, like filtration by dimension of supports, <br/>gluing techniques, Picard groups, Witt groups, and more.<br/><br/>Tensor triangular geometry is a relatively new theory which can <br/>simultaneously claim a large catalog of examples ranging from Algebra to <br/>Analysis, a strong corpus of abstract techniques and a broad range of <br/>applications. The strength of tensor triangular geometry is illustrated <br/>by several new theorems in algebraic geometry and modular representation <br/>theory, whose statement does not involve tensor triangular geometry but <br/>whose proof does. This project is highly interdisciplinary and appeals <br/>to mathematicians from very different horizons.
0962682	Collaborative Research: Integrative analysis of the scaling of primate feeding systems	BCS	Biological Anthropology	06/15/2010	08/30/2012	Callum Ross	IL	University of Chicago	Continuing grant	Carolyn Ehardt	05/31/2013	$282,837.00		rossc@uchicago.edu	5801 South Ellis Avenue	Chicago	IL	606375418	7737028669	SBE	1392	1392, 9251	$0.00	Feeding systems are the energy-acquiring systems of humans and other primates. The teeth, jaws, and muscles, are the proximal interface between primates and their environments. Therefore, understanding the evolutionary forces that shape those components is essential to understanding the adaptation and evolution of primates. This work tests hypotheses and models relating diversity in the primate feeding system to size-related changes in food intake rate. It documents how shape and movements of the mandible, the size and architecture of the jaw muscles, and the amount of food an animal eats in a single bite change with body size to meet size-required changes in food intake rate of primates. These data will be collected using computed tomography (CT) scanning of primate mandibles, anatomical studies of primate chewing muscles, and behavioral studies of primates feeding in captivity. Mathematical models of the feeding system will be tested, modified and improved, then used to examine how feeding system designs in different evolutionary groups of primates balance trade-offs between advantages of bite force production, chewing speed and gape. <br/><br/>This research will create novel and important data sets that can be accessed in the future by other researchers interested in feeding biomechanics, bone biomechanics, and musculoskeletal systems in general. The investigators will continue to recruit under-represented minority and female undergraduates to receive training and mentoring in research and advice on their paths to graduate, medical, and other professional schools. These students will collaborate in all aspects of the work, including presentation and publication. The PIs will continue their outreach programs to local schools and their synergistic activities with other NSF-funded projects.

Jumping spiders have four pairs of eyes specialized for different functions, making them useful models for studying this type of integration. Their unique principal eyes function like telephoto lenses and have very high resolution. The retinas are tiny but can be directed, via movable eye tubes, toward different stimuli. The less complex secondary eyes are specialized for detecting movement. In this research, the detailed function of each type of eye will first be studied by masking sets of eyes and measuring spiders' responses to stimuli such as video images of prey. The investigators will also build an innovative eyetracker to monitor and measure the movement of the principal eyes. Next, the investigators will study how the eyes interact, and how spiders integrate visual information from each eye type. The comparison of two spider species, each with the same eye arrangement but very different behavioral patterns, will provide examples of how this basic system can be modified for different purposes. The results will shed light on how specialized units in a perceptual system function together to provide information that can be analyzed by a tiny brain. In addition, the results will have implications for robotic design. The project will provide support for a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and numerous undergraduates, and will enhance an international collaboration. Results will be communicated to lay audiences via a website in coordination with the American Arachnological Society.
0955626	CAREER: Applying New Tools to the Discovery and Measurement of the New Standard Model	PHY	ELEMENTARY PARTICLE ACCEL USER	07/01/2010	06/01/2014	Kyle Cranmer	NY	New York University	Continuing grant	Saul Gonzalez	06/30/2016	$400,000.00		kyle.cranmer@nyu.edu	70 WASHINGTON SQUARE S	NEW YORK	NY	100121019	2129982121	MPS	1221	1045, 1187	$0.00	Experimental studies of proton collisions at the LHC are likely to reveal the answers to some of the most fundamental questions in physics. Already, experiments like Fermi GST and PAMELA are producing very exciting - though puzzling - results that may be major hints to an unexpectedly rich dark matter sector. There are many possibilities for dramatic discoveries, which will usher in a new era for dark matter and fundamental particle physics. How one combines the complementary information from these disparate measurements into a cohesive picture is not readily apparent. Initially, it is unlikely that an obvious picture will emerge that is more compelling than conventional explanations, such as poorly understood modeling or experimental systematics. Thus, one must be prepared to pose serious questions about the data, the theoretical interpretation, the experimental systematics, and additional modeling assumptions that are not limited by avoidable technical limitations. This award supports a program of physics research built around a unifying approach to large-scale scientific data analysis, initially dealing with data from LHC experiments, in a way that is scalable with respect to complexity of data, experimental apparatuses, and theoretical models. The approach could have profound impact on early standard model physics measurements and the extension to Higgs physics and beyond as well as facilitate communication and cooperation between ATLAS and CMS, between theorists and experimentalists, and among researchers from different disciplines. <br/>In terms of broader impact the key development in this award that enables the scalable approach to large-scale data analysis is applicable beyond the field of particle physics. Experiments as diverse as Fermi GST, HESS, and the IceCube neutrino telescope are already exploring the use of this technology, which is a concrete indication of the broader impacts of the proposed research. Additional impacts follow from a well-integrated educational and outreach component. A portable and professionally-designed exhibit will be constructed for use at the popular New York City World Science Festival street fair, area science fairs, career fairs, and the like. The booth will utilize existing material from the ATLAS outreach group. Additionally, the exhibit will be the basis for a project integrated into a teaching methods course in the Department of Teaching and Learning at NYU. The project will be to design activities for the exhibit itself and to develop and assess physics teaching methods. Thus, the exhibit, the activities, and the assessment of the exhibit will be the culmination of a semester-long project, and those teachers can bring the developed activities to their own schools. Finally, the PI will mentor high-school students from the Harlem Children's Society so that they can understand and operate the demonstrations, thus serving as peer-group liaisons, and role models for under-represented groups in the sciences.
0963750	Neural Mechanisms Underlying the Effects of Stress on Brain Cognition and Development	BCS	COGNEURO	06/15/2010	04/03/2012	Adriana Galvan	CA	University of California-Los Angeles	Continuing grant	Akaysha Tang	05/31/2013	$411,258.00		agalvan@ucla.edu	10889 Wilshire Boulevard	LOS ANGELES	CA	900951406	3107940102	SBE	1699	1699	$0.00	People are often forced to make decisions under stress. This is particularly true during adolescence, a developmental period with significant social, emotional and stressful changes. Increases in adolescent life stressors are paralleled by compromised decision-making and impulse control, both of which are subserved by brain regions that undergo significant maturation during this developmental window. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Adriana Galvan is investigating the effects of daily stress on cognition and brain function in adolescents and an adult comparison group. Daily stress is monitored via a personal digital device that adolescents carry. It provides daily measures of stress over two weeks. On a day when adolescents report a high level of stress, and on a separate day when they report a low level of stress, they visit the laboratory to receive a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scan. While receiving the brain scan, they perform computer games that are designed to measure decision-making and impulse control behavior. In addition, their stress hormone levels related to brain function are measured. By taking this multi-method approach, Dr. Galvan is learning how daily stress influences cognitive neurodevelopment in adolescents. She predicts that stress will result in worse decision-making and impulse control in both adolescents and adults. However, this effect is exaggerated in adolescents, who are even more susceptible to the effects of high stress days. <br/><br/>This research can have significant implications beyond providing evidence for the effects of stress on neurodevelopment. It can provide a broader conceptualization of why adolescents respond differently to their environment, and how this difference eventually influences the poor decision-making that is characteristic of adolescence. The field is in critical need of an integrated approach to brain-environment interactions. Further, this work will be the first of its kind to merge daily monitoring tools together with functional brain imaging and can, therefore, serve as a methodological template for other areas of cognitive neuroscience, beyond developmental work. The understanding of neural correlates of decision-making in development also provides an important baseline for understanding impairments in this very basic cognitive process, as manifested in a broad range of poor developmental outcomes and psychiatric disorders, including drug addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and schizophrenia, all of which have frequent onset in adolescence. In addition, understanding the teenage brain will undoubtedly contribute to social policy decisions that hinge on age and maturation, including the juvenile justice system, driving laws, teenage pregnancy, and educational policies. As such, this project has broad health and societal implications. Finally, this research project provides training opportunities for students at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels, and is committed to advancing the training of students from underrepresented groups.

In some task domains, such as air-traffic control, emergency vehicle dispatching, and in-car navigation, multitasking cannot be avoided, and people need to interleave secondary tasks such as navigation with primary life-critical tasks such as driving.  To maximize overall human effectiveness, user interfaces intended for life-critical and time-critical complex multitasking need to be designed to account for a person?s ability to monitor and respond to multiple information sources in parallel.  And yet, there is little or no practical scientific theory to explain the human abilities, limitations, and strategies for multimodal (auditory and visual) multitasking.<br/><br/>This project develops the science base needed for predictive modeling of human abilities to integrate across multiple modalities to accomplish multiple tasks in parallel.  The project will develop a theory of Perceptual Integration in Multimodal Multitasking with rigorous, detailed, high-fidelity computational cognitive modeling of carefully collected human data, including detailed eye movement data, for tasks that are positioned between the lab for high resolution tasks and data and the real world to insure practical application. The modeling will emphasize the role of central executive cognitive decisions for managing perceptual processing, moving the eyes, and coordinating motor responses to interleaved task demands.<br/><br/>The project benefits society by studying and revealing the limitations to human multimodal multitasking performance at the core, and by providing theory that can be put to practice in the design of mission control centers, subway dispatching centers, emergency rooms, and computer systems for vehicles.  The theory will lead to practical design decisions that will improve the safety of subways, nuclear power plants, highways, hospitals, and vehicles.

The work has three major aims: (a) understanding how team hypotheses, insights, and problem orientation are reflected in their conversations; (b) developing and testing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect teams? hypotheses, insights, and problem orientation; and (c) developing and testing methods to communicate the results of NLP analyses to provide teams with feedback on their own and other teams? reasoning processes. These goals are addressed through behavioral studies, NLP research, and tool development and evaluation.<br/>Intellectual merit: The project provides unique contributions in four areas: (a) understanding how team analytical processes are evidenced in team communication; (b) advancing the state-of-the art in NLP by developing discourse analysis techniques for use in collaborative analysis applications; (c) applying NLP techniques to the support of team analytical processes; and (d) designing interfaces to provide feedback within and across teams. The research also furthers the training and education of undergraduate and graduate students. <br/>Broader impact: The project has the potential to improve collaborative investigative analysis in many fields of critical importance to society, including criminal justice, intelligence, science, and epidemiology. The results will provide new tools for analysts, recommendations for organizational practices to improve the quality of collaborative analysis, new methods for training professional analysts, and new learning tools for graduate programs in fields such as epidemiological analysis and criminal justice.

Political psychologists attempt to understand the psychological underpinnings, roots, and consequences of political behavior. Some of this work attempts to understand political phenomena by applying and enhancing theories developed through research done in psychological laboratories. Findings regarding mediation and moderation of real-world effects have often led to extensions and revisions of political and psychological theories. Other political psychology involves the development of completely new theory to provide psychological accounts of political phenomena, thus contributing to basic understanding of how the mind works in the important context of politics. <br/><br/>In light of the vitality of the field and growing graduate student interest, the idea of establishing a summer training institute in political psychology was developed. The Summer Institute in Political Psychology (SIPP) is a 3-week program designed to advance the research capabilities of graduate students from around the world studying political science, psychology, and other social sciences. The Summer Institute has aimed to enrich the graduate training of participants by offering a broad and intensified complement to the classroom training that is usually available at graduate institutions. By bringing together a large set of faculty offering lectures on a diverse set of topics, SIPP exposed graduate students to (1) a broad range of research literature in political psychology, (b) the research styles and approaches of an array of scholars working in political psychology, and (c) training in the varied set of research methods employed by political psychologists, as well as (d) creating inter-disciplinary networks among the participants to support their on-going research efforts and cement their long-term commitments to social science scholarship. <br/><br/>One of the best ways to enhance research productivity in political psychology over the long term is to recruit and train talented, energetic, and motivated cohorts of scholars to join the field. SIPP does just this and thus enhances the vitality of political psychology's contributions to social science literatures.

This CAREER program describes a plan of research with realistic potential for broader impact which takes good advantage of the PI's experience and expertise and positions the PI to make a significant contribution to NOvA in the areas of calibration and data analysis, areas which are obviously important too for future particle physics experiments. The IPND will be installed on the surface at Fermilab starting in the summer of 2010, providing a test bed for the NOvA detector design and systems integration. After a year of running on the surface, the detector will be disassembled and reinstalled underground, becoming the NOvA near detector. The neutrino data collected with the detector allow for the development of detector calibration techniques, signal versus background separation algorithms, and tests of the simulation of nuclear hadronization and reinteraction processes, all of which are crucial to the success of the experiment. Within the broader impact, the project will be a training ground for undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoc. The IPND program offers ample short term hardware and analysis projects, ideally suited to an undergraduate summer research experience. To ensure a vibrant scientific program into the future, one needs to capture the imagination of students well before they enter college. To that end, Vahle proposes providing local high school and middle school teachers the opportunity to participate in summer research projects on site at Fermilab. In the summers she is in Williamsburg, she would exploit the relationship developed between the W&M neutrino group and the local school teachers by employing a teacher for several weeks over the summer to help develop, then implement, science events.

Eavey	05/31/2013	$144,704.00		dsmall@wharton.upenn.edu	Research Services	Philadelphia	PA	191046205	2158987293	SBE	1333	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The instrumental variable (IV) method is an approach to estimating a causal relationship in the presence of unmeasured confounders. A central concern in most studies using the IV method is that the IV is not perfectly valid in the sense that it is correlated with unmeasured confounders. This project will contribute to improved methodology for using the IV method. The project will develop a new, more interpretable sensitivity analysis for IV studies that is calibrated to observed covariates. A new way of designing IV studies to make the study less sensitive to the proposed IV being invalid (i.e., correlated with unmeasured confounders) also will be developed. The approach will involve setting up a matched comparison between a group of subjects with a high level of the IV and a group of subjects with a low level of the IV in such a way that the IV is a strong predictor of the treatment that is received in the two groups. Finally, a new IV method for studies with binary outcomes will be developed that is easier to implement and more robust than existing methods.<br/><br/>A main goal of many empirical studies in the social sciences is to provide evidence about the effects caused by policies or treatments. For practical and/or ethical reasons, most such studies are observational rather than randomized studies. A central difficulty for observational studies is that because treatments were not randomly assigned, the subjects receiving different treatments may not be comparable so differing outcomes after treatment may not be effects caused by the treatment. The instrumental variable (IV) method is an approach for estimating a causal relationship that can overcome unmeasured confounding. The basic idea is to use an instrumental variable to extract variation in the treatment that is unrelated to the unmeasured confounders, and then use this variation to estimate the causal effect of the treatment on the outcome. This project will provide ways to better assess sensitivity of results from using the IV methods to concerns that the proposed IV is related to unmeasured confounders (and thus not a valid IV), and better ways to make use of an IV when the outcome of the study is a binary variable. The project also will develop and disseminate freely available software for implementing the new methods. By offering rigorous analysis in complex setting otherwise not suited for experimentation, improved methodology for observational studies has the potential to lead to improved policies and practices of both public and private institutions.

Migration has been called a keystone behavior by some researchers because of the large effects that migratory animals have on their ecosystems. One of the main goals of this meeting is to bring together researchers who are trying to understand how and why animals migrate so that biologists can understand, for example, how to conserve salmon in the Pacific Northwest and how migrants may affect the spread of the avian flu. The best way to answer these important questions is to perform integrative research on migration, which combines, among other things, multiple scientific disciplines (such as meteorology, genetics, physiology, and behavior), many different species, and laboratory-based and field-based studies. This meeting and the associated travel grants are designed to attract students and post-doctoral researchers interested in migration from all over the world, which is appropriate since migration is a global phenomenon. The meeting will allow these young investigators to mingle with the speakers and other researchers who are committed to performing integrative migration biology. The students will also have the opportunity to present their own research in coordinated sessions. Individuals who are not able to attend the meeting will be able to gain insights about migration biology through papers authored by the speakers and published in the journal, Integrative and Comparative Biology, a high-impact, well-read journal. Overall, this meeting is designed to increase the visibility of integrative migration biology and promote integrative projects that will lead to a deeper understanding of a phenomenon that has puzzled both children and adults everywhere for hundreds of years: how and why do animals migrate?

It will partially support the salary and the tuition of graduate students to work on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It will also support a part time staff (undergraduate student) for the new outreach program he has initiated at the University. His research at CMS is focused on the search for the Higgs boson through its decay into two photons, its most likely discovery mode at the LHC. He also proposes to use the techniques needed for the Higgs discovery to search for signs of new physics, including manifestations of hidden valleys, supersymmetry, and new strong dynamics. It is expected his experience at D0 should enable him to take a leading role in such searches. In coordination with the New Jersey Chapter of the American Association of Physics Teachers, he is initiating a Saturday Morning Physics program of lectures at Rutgers University on the cutting edge developments in science and technology. It will target high school students from under-represented urban areas such as Camden, Newark, New Brunswick, and Trenton, aiming to improve their perception of science and inspire some to pursue careers in engineering or science. Students who attend the lectures would be tracked in an attempt to understand whether this increases the fraction that pursue science in college. An undergraduate student will aid in this effort. In addition, he plans to hold seminars following these lectures targeted to high school teachers. In order to better evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of this program, and to help implement the material into the actual lesson plans, the PI plans to closely involve high school teachers and pre-service teachers. These lesson plans would be posted on a web site - creating a resource for teachers not able to attend the lecture/seminars. Working with the Graduate School of Education and the NJ Department of Education a further goal is for teachers to earn developmental credit for the lesson plans evolving from the lectures and other projects such as QuarkNet activities.

We now know that undersea explosive volcanism is not as rare as we once thought and there is a distinct possibility that these muds may, in fact, have large volcanic ash components. This research unravels the origin of these muds and employs a novel, new, statistical approach to determine quantitatively the amount and origin/source of the volcanic ash component in them. The work is potentially transformative in terms of our understanding of seafloor sediments and could completely change how we characterize and understand deep sea sedimentation. It may also allow us to determine seafloor volcanic eruption ash-dispersal patterns and understand, for the first time, how important undersea volcanic eruptions are to the global seafloor sediment budget and geochemical cycling. Broader impacts of the work include support of a graduate student whose gender is under-represented in the sciences and undergraduates. The work is relevant to the NSF-funded MARGINS and Ocean Drilling Program missions and science plans. Resulting data will be publicly available through the NSF-funded SedDB data portal and data archive.

Larson and colleagues have already demonstrated a tight correlation between the upper 10 cm of soil moisture as measured in situ and GPS SNR observations and have been funded by NSF/ATM and EAR for that work. Now, based on observations at the Marshall Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) GPS station in Boulder, CO just before and just after a significant snow event, Larson and colleagues have demonstrated an obvious change in the GPS SNR frequency pattern at varying satellite elevation angles before and after a snow event that compares well with model predictions based on electrodynamic theory. Forward models of the GSP SNR frequency patterns were used to compute predicted snow depth proximal to the antenna and then compared to in situ observations with very good agreement. Support from this grant will allow for further evaluation of the technique and consideration of error sources. Specifically, the PIs will : 1) Develop an electrodynamic model of snow effects on GPS data and an algorithm to estimate snow water equivalent (SNE); 2) Evaluate the sensitivity to snow of the receivers and antennas currently used in the U.S. (e.g., PBO GPS network); 3) Develop a model to flag GPS data corrupted by snow/ice effects on top of antennas and model these effects to improve positions for volcano, tectonic and atmospheric studies; 4) Improve the utility of other hydrologic products derived from GPS, such as soil moisture and hydrologic loading; and 5) Develop a low-power and low-cost GPS system to measure SWE. The project involves collaborations between GPS geodesists, hydrologists, snow and climate scientists, and electrical engineers. Three snow calibration sites will be developed in Colorado at Marshall (NCAR), Niwot Ridge (LTER), and the USFS Fraser Experimental Forest, each with in situ snow pack observational sensors and GPS sites. The GPS deployments will involve UNAVCO Facility field engineering assistance. Should the GPS snow sensor technique prove robust for wide spread application of algorithms at existing continuously operated GPS sites the broader impacts will include improved density of snow pack observations across the continental U.S. as leveraged off existing EarthScope PBO stations with important implications to water resources management and climate studies. Observations would complement existing in situ snow pack observational programs (NOAAs SNOTEL) and would provide additional ground truth for satellite borne optical observations of snow cover. <br/><br/><br/>***

The specimens in the William Zinsmeister Collection, a comprehensive collection of Antarctic fossil molluscs, have been the basis of much of this research. The Zinsmeister Collection has not previously been easily available to researchers outside of Purdue University. This proposal seeks support to make specimen records and images widely available for the Zinsmeister Collection, recently transferred to the Paleontological Research Institution at Cornell. The Zinsmeister Collection contains approximately 22,000 specimens of Cretaceous-Eocene fossil mollusks from Seymour Island, Antarctica, including bulk samples from measured Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary sections. The PIs propose to protect the sizeable investment in this collection and ensure that its full potential is realized by making it more widely known and available to the research community through an online, publicly available, object record and image database. During this project, the collection will be upgraded to the highest curatorial standards. Easier access to information on the Zinsmeister Collection will promote Antarctic research using this material and it could be used to raise awareness of climate change, extinction, and evolution in through teaching programs.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>The PIs will mount the most spectacular specimen in the collection, the heteromorphic ammonite Diplomoceras maximum, in the Cretaceous area of the permanent exhibits in Paleontological Research Institute?s (PRI) Museum of the Earth. A web based virtual exhibition hosted on PRI?s web site will be created. Building from the online exhibition, in celebration of Earth Day 2011, PRI will host a virtual tour of the online exhibit. A teacher professional development program will be created using specimens and data from the collection and virtual exhibits to explore topics in global change and evolution in support of secondary school science teachers. The exposure of a broader public to the collection will create awareness not only for the ongoing research in the polar regions, but also for the value of paleontological studies as important contributions to the solution of the problems of global climate change.

The course materials reflect advanced manufacturing processes recently adopted by industry and state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies and have the potential for significant near-term impact on industry. The course is taught simultaneously at all three universities and the students are collaborating across university boundaries and so the project includes significant efforts in the design and development of collaborative teaching and learning mechanisms. The evaluation, being conducted by an experienced evaluator, is examining the effectiveness of the instructional material and strategies and the effect on student learning. The project team is disseminating through website postings, conference presentations, and journal publications. Broader impacts include the dissemination of the instructional materials and results.

However, an important byproduct of lean combustion is NOx (x = 1, 2). While cost-effective technologies have been demonstrated for the remediation of NOx produced at stationary sources, solutions for the aftertreatment of NOx produced by mobile sources including diesel powered vehicles remains a major challenge. One of the most significant aspects is that Platinum-containing catalysts are the most effective catalysts for this operation, and the amount of platinum required makes these catalysts prohibitively expensive. In this proposal which calls for collaboration between PIs Thompson from University of Michigan and Schneider from University of Notre Dame, an industrial partner, General Motors, is added to make it a GOALI proposal as well as a Collaborative one. The intent is to resolve why catalytic activity of about the same magnitude as platinum has been observed with a non-precious metal containing perovskite catalyst originally observed by General Motors scientists, and to determine if rugged, inexpensive catalysts can be demonstrated which could in fact replace platinum. This would be a significant change in our understanding of reactions that are catalyzed by platinum, and on a more practical level, would open up the area of diesel-powered vehicles with the improved efficiencies and reduced GHG emissions expected, as less-expensive catalytic after-treatments or mufflers could be available. The program involves the two universities and the industrial partner at many points of contact and in various phases of the work. Students will benefit from the collaboration and from the contact with industry. In addition the PIs will leverage existing education and outreach programs on the campuses to both interest and educate society about the issue and benefits from success in the project.
0969129	Nucleon Structure and Nuclear Force Studies	PHY	Nuclear & Hadron Quantum Chrom	07/01/2010	04/12/2012	Bryon Anderson	OH	Kent State University	Continuing grant	Kenneth Hicks	06/30/2014	$465,000.00	John Watson	bdanders@kent.edu	OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER	KENT	OH	442420001	3306722070	MPS	1232		$0.00	There are two main research areas that will be explored with this research grant. Both of these areas will provide training and dissertation research data for Ph.D. students from Kent State. First, the group will be investigating the structure of the nucleon, i.e., of the neutron and proton. The primary project here is to study the distribution of electrical charge inside the neutron. Although the neutron has no net electrical charge, the three quarks that make up the neutron have electrical charge: plus charge for the up quark, and minus charge for the two down quarks, with the charges of all three summing up to zero. Since the up quark tends to be closer to the center of the neutron, and the down quarks more on the surface, there is a distribution of charge within the neutron, with more plus charge near the center, and more minus charge near the surface. Precision measurements of this charge distribution will be made at Thomas Jefferson Laboratory, using equipment developed at Kent State. These measurements are of considerable scientific importance, because they provide constraints on theoretical models attempting to describe the quark structure of the neutron. The second project is to study the origin of the intrinsic angular momentum, known as the spin, of the proton. This project has been underway for several years with the STAR detector system at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory; although the total spin of the proton is known, its origin in terms of the interactions and motions of the quarks that makeup the proton is not well understood. Measurements performed with the RHIC accelerator are now providing a clearer picture of the structure of the proton.<br/><br/>The second main area of research is the study of the correlated pair structure of nuclei. In the dominant model of nuclear structure, the neutrons and protons move independently of each other in stable quantum orbits inside the nucleus, much like the orbits of the electrons surrounding the nucleus. The developers of this model, called the nuclear shell model, shared the Nobel Prize in 1963. Recent research at Brookhaven National Laboratory and Thomas Jefferson Laboratory has shown that about 20% of the time, a given neutron or proton, instead of moving in an independent orbit, will be part of a pair of particles moving back-to-back at high velocity. These are called correlated pairs because their velocities are similar in size, but back-to-back. A fascinating result from that earlier research is that neutron-proton pairs occur 20 times more often than neutron-neutron pairs or proton-proton pairs. This finding has important implications for understanding neutron stars. These results came from the study of the carbon nucleus. The group will be extending that work to the helium nucleus, and observing correlated pairs for a larger range of velocities than were explored in previous work. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include an increased understanding of the physical universe distributed through refereed journals of nuclear physics and the training of doctoral-level physicists needed in industry, medical physics, and academia.

Particles with enormous energies regularly strike the Earth from within our galaxy and beyond. Understanding the origins of these particles will require accurate models of the most violent processes in the universe. However, progress in the field of high-energy cosmic rays is currently limited by the rarity of the most interesting rays striking Earth. Indeed, the continuation of the field beyond the current generation of observatories may become financially and practically impossible if new ways are not found to achieve remote coverage over large portions of the Earth's surface. <br/><br/>With this award, these scientists will investigate a new technique: the remote sensing via bistatic radar technology of cosmic ray induced extensive air showers. They build on experience gained by the MARIACHI project in developing this technique, the opportunity afforded by the location of the northern hemisphere's largest cosmic ray observatory, the Telescope Array, in Utah, and the donation of analog television transmission equipment to this effort by a local television station. The successful outcome of these studies would be the development of a new detection technique with the potential of having a transformative effect on the field of ultra-high energy cosmic ray research.<br/><br/>For Broader Impacts, this project has potential for connecting the local community to the astrophysics research currently being conducted in Utah. Radar techniques similar to those being used for cosmic ray studies have long been utilized in the study of micrometeors, and this group has already hosted public events in which visitors to the Millard County Cosmic Ray Center listen to meteor showers and learn about the cosmic ray project. It will also connect with their successful ASPIRE program.
0968805	RUI: Energy Density Fluctuations, Negative Energy Detection and Gravity	PHY	GRAVITATIONAL THEORY	09/01/2010	06/28/2010	Thomas Roman	CT	Central Connecticut State University	Standard Grant	Pedro Marronetti	08/31/2014	$135,000.00		roman@ccsu.edu	1615 Stanley Street	New Britain	CT	060504010	8608322365	MPS	1244	7483, 9229	$0.00	This award supports research to understand the properties of negative energy. One focus is on methods of indirectly detecting this unusual form of energy using, in part, techniques developed in the field of quantum optics. The PI and a collaborator will work with an experimentalist to determine if such detection is feasible. A second major focus will be to study the distribution of energy fluctuations in the vacuum. Contrary to our experience in everyday life, the laws of quantum physics tell us that empty space is not really empty but consists of ever-present fluctuations of energy. The average value of the energy in empty space is zero, as one would expect, but quantum mechanics says that there must be fluctuations around this mean value. In order to average out to zero, there must be both negative as well as positive fluctuations. What is the likelihood then of getting a negative value in a single measurement? Previous work yields a surprisingly high probability for one spatial dimension. Current efforts are geared toward trying to determine the form of this probability distribution in the three-spatial-dimensional world in which we live.<br/><br/>The laws of quantum mechanics allow the existence of states of energy that are lower than that of the vacuum. If there are no restrictions on negative energy, then bizarre macroscopic effects might become possible. These would include wormholes and warp drives for faster-than light travel, violations of the second law of thermodynamics (e.g., refrigerators with no power sources), and the destruction of black holes. However, the same laws of quantum mechanics which allow this form of energy to exist severely limit its behavior. Typically, the longer the negative energy lasts, the smaller its magnitude. This work lies at the juncture of the fields of quantum theory, Einstein's general relativity, and thermodynamics. The only direct probe of negative energy is gravity, but the amounts of negative energy obtainable in the laboratory are minute. Therefore, one has to resort to indirect detection, such as measuring the effect of negative energy on atomic decay rates. The issue of the form of the probability distribution for energy fluctuations is key to understanding the structure of the vacuum, and has implications for other fields such as cosmology. Undergraduates are being prepared to engage in this research through Mathematica-based courses developed by the PI.

The goal of this research project is to tackle this challenge and lay the foundation for the next generation of search engines. Instead of simply matching a query to documents that contain query words, the approach developed here is a unified user-centric retrieval framework that consists of: (1) personalization: learning a user model that takes into consideration the content, context and decision criteria of a user; (2) language processing: learning better text representation for retrieval from heterogeneous corpus and linguistic resources; and (3) social networks: further improving the user model based on social norms and a user's social networks. To evaluate the framework, a personalized social search engine will be developed. <br/><br/>The result of this project will be a unified retrieval framework with a set of novel techniques applicable across a wide range of information retrieval (IR) tasks, including: search engines, recommender systems and adaptive filtering systems. Through the PI's industry collaboration, the results of this project are expected to be incorporated in commercial systems, and thus benefit millions of users. <br/><br/>K-12 students, undergraduate, graduate students, and engineers in Silicon Valley will be involved and benefit from the project. The project will lead to research-based educational materials (lecture slides, video lectures, book chapters and course projects). Project results, including publications, open source software, annotated data sets, demos and course materials, will be disseminated via the project website (http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~yiz/futureofsearch).

The protein folding problem has been studied for three decades, and despite the great progress in recent years, there are still many questions to be answered. Only with the synergy of experimentalists and theoreticians from diverse disciplines will this challenge be answered. Moreover, there are now new computational tools along with new experimental techniques being developed for the studies of in vivo and in vitro protein folding. It is very important to bring together these scientists who are pioneering these quantitative approaches to create a novel collaboration for answering the challenges in protein folding. This workshop in Tempe, Arizona, May 9-13, 2010, will bring together a select group of some of the world's leading scientists from physics, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering. All have unique expertise in various aspects of protein folding, experimentation, and computational modelling. Protein folding has advanced in recent years with the use of high performance computing. The workshop will address the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of protein folding and the role of flexibility in protein sequence-structure-function relationship. Simulation and theoretical methods will be discussed in application to protein stability, folding, specific pathways and enzymatic activity. <br/><br/>Proteins are among the most incredible molecular machines in living systems. Not only are they accurate, proficient and specific, but they also have the rare ability to acquire new functions and structures to carry out a diverse set of functions, from enzymes to cytoskeleton to membrane channels. When a protein folds into its unique 3-dimensional structure, it starts immediately performing its function that has been evolved through the years. Thus, protein folding is central in understanding of living things. The list of workshop participants represents a truly impressive and wide-ranging cast of established leaders in the field, plus some younger people who are starting to make an impact. The meeting is designed to consist of a set of highly focused and intimate sessions. Understanding protein folding and hence mis-folding, has implications for health and medicine. We will open the meeting to local attendees from Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, including graduate students and postdocs.

The main theme of the proposed research activities relates to the reliable econometric estimation of such events based high-frequency intraday financial data.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The availability of high-frequency intraday asset prices has spurred a large and rapidly growing literature concerned with the analysis of this potentially rich new data source. This project aims to further expand on our ability to extract useful information about important economic phenomena from such data through the development of new econometric procedures and empirical applications thereof. Specifically, combining the insights from traditional Extreme Value Theory (EVT), developed in the context of actuary science under the assumption of independent occurrence of rare events, with so-called realized variation measures, designed to account for empirically realistic volatility clustering in financial markets, the new econometric estimators that we seek to develop as part of the proposal hold the promise of delivering much more accurate estimates for extreme tail events than any currently available procedures.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The proposed research program has a number of important broadly defined implications for the theoretical and empirical analyzes of economic and financial data, and should be of interests to theoretically oriented econometricians, as well as applied macroeconomists and financial researchers and regulators alike with an interest in the estimation of tail events. In particular, the most important and difficult to manage financial market risks are invariably associated with rare events. Hence, the ability to more accurately measure and possibly forecast the tails, holds the promise of improved risk management procedures that are better geared toward controlling large risks, leaving aside the smaller continuous price moves. By enhancing our understanding of the types of economic news that induce large price moves, or jumps, in financial asset prices, the empirical implementations of the new procedures will also help shed new light on the fundamental linkages between asset markets and the real economy. The lack of investor confidence and fear of tail events are often singled out as one of the main culprits behind the massive losses in market values in the advent of the Fall 2008 financial crises, and the idea that rare disasters may help explain apparent mis-pricing has spurred a rapidly growing recent literature. The key arguments put forth in that literature typically hinge on probabilities of severe events that exceed those materialized in-sample, or probabilities calibrated to reflect an unusually broad set of assets and/or countries. Instead, our proposed econometric procedures hold the promise of reliable estimating the likely occurrence of tail events in a given market based on actually observed high-frequency data, without resorting to peso type explanations.<br/><br/>The research results will be disseminated broadly at seminars and conferences. The project will also seek to integrate research and education by involving both graduate and undergraduate students in the proposed research activities. All of the research results, including new computer programs and databases, will be made easily available through the web.

This method has a fundamental shortcoming: the optimization does not explicitly target the kinds of distinctions necessary to accomplish the task at hand, such as discriminating (for ASR) between different words that are acoustically confusable or (for MT) between different target-language words that express the multiple meanings of a polysemous source-language word.<br/><br/>Discriminative optimization of the LM, which would overcome this shortcoming, requires large quantities of paired input-output sequences: speech and its reference transcription for ASR or source-language (e.g. Chinese) sentences and their translations into the target language (say, English) for MT. Such resources are expensive, and limit the efficacy of discriminative training methods.<br/><br/>In a radical departure from convention, this project is investigating discriminative training using easily available, *unpaired* input and output sequences: un-transcribed speech or monolingual source-language text and unpaired target-language text. Two key ideas are being pursued: (i) unlabeled input sequences (e.g. speech or Chinese text) are processed to learn likely confusions encountered by the ASR or MT system; (ii) unpaired output sequences (English text) are leveraged to discriminate between these well-formed sentences from the (supposed) ill-formed sentences the system could potentially confuse them with.<br/><br/>This self-supervised discriminative training, if successful, will advance machine intelligence in fundamental ways that impact many other applications.

Baerwald	05/31/2016	$906,609.00	Amy Lobben, Douglas Kennett	jorbell@uoregon.edu	5219 UNIVERSITY OF OREGON	Eugene	OR	974035219	5413465131	SBE	7751		$0.00	Since the 1970s, climate scientists have developed increasingly sophisticated models of the world climate system. These models are converging on predictions about climate changes that are likely to occur in coming decades. Such changes are certain to provoke human responses and many commentators have suggested what those responses are likely to be in particular parts of the world. Nevertheless, human populations are complex systems in which changes in one part of the system can have significant consequences for other, perhaps quite remote, parts of the system - meaning that human responses to climate change must also be studied as processes in a complex system involving, potentially at least, all human societies. To date, however, the social sciences have not produced models of large scale human population systems that integrate predictions from climate models. One reason for this neglect may be that such work requires knowledge not only of the basic principles of human behavior and the techniques for modeling it, but also of (1) current climate models; (2) geographic information systems (GIS) which provide a means for organizing geographic data worldwide, including human population data; (3) statistical techniques for analyzing the large amounts of data produced from population simulations; and (4) actual human responses to climate changes both in the recent past (e.g., Darfur) and in the more remote past (e.g., ancient Maya). Accordingly, the present project includes two political scientists with background in behavioral modeling; a climatologist who has worked extensively on climate modeling; an expert in geographic information systems; an expert in applied mathematics and statistics; and an archaeologist. Initial steps toward the behavioral model will be tested against known cases of climate change in the recent past (e.g. Darfur) and the more remote past (e.g., the Mayan collapse). To the extent predictions from the developing model do not match known human responses in such cases, its parameters will be adjusted - and, subsequently, tested against further such cases. <br/><br/>Archaeological evidence shows that climate change has undermined many civilizations in the past but also that the climate changes per se were often less damaging than the human responses to those changes - including mass migration and armed conflict. In the interdependent modern world, human responses to climate changes have the potential to ripple well beyond an immediately affected area, and responses to such changes in different and perhaps quite remote areas might interact in negative ways. Thus, well developed models of likely human responses to expected climate changes - including abrupt changes - will allow policy makers to anticipate not only local consequences of local climate changes, but also geographically perhaps quite remote consequences. The project takes initial steps toward more fully developed models of human responses to climate change, just as early climate models can now be seen as initial steps toward the more fully developed climate models that presently exist.
0961414	Collaborative Research: The Great Southern Coccolithophore Belt	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	06/15/2010	09/13/2011	Nicholas Bates		Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS), Inc.	Continuing grant	David L. Garrison	05/31/2015	$305,793.00		nick.bates@bios.edu	17 Biological Station	St. George's GE01			4412971880	GEO	1650	1389, 9150, 1382, EGCH	$0.00	Intellectual merit: Recent advances in satellite remote sensing enable estimation of suspended calcium carbonate (particulate inorganic carbon or 'PIC') from space. This radiative approach is operationally specific to marine coccolithophores (Haptophyceae) and sensitive enough to quantify PIC concentrations in oligotrophic gyres. Global images of suspended PIC taken over the seven years of the MODIS Aqua mission show a 'Great Belt' of PIC near the sub-Antarctic front of the Southern Ocean that circles the globe. This feature occurs every year during austral summer and appears to be within the high-nutrient, low chlorophyll region of the Southern Ocean. The area of the Great Belt is ~88 million km2, 26% of the global ocean. Evidence from several cruises into the Great Belt region of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific sectors has verified elevated concentrations of coccolithophores; previous work in the Atlantic sector verified high optical scattering from PIC. The few ship observations we have are entirely consistent with the satellite views. In this project, the investigators will systematically study the coccolithophores of the Great Belt guided by the following science goals: (a) identify the coccolithophore species within this belt; (b) measure the abundance of coccolithophores and associated PIC; (c) measure coccolithopore calcification rates; (d) elucidate factors that may limit coccolithophore latitudinal range (e.g. stratification, temperature, macronutrients, trace metals, grazing); (e) demonstrate whether the variability in PIC relates to shallow export flux; (f) define how variability in PIC production relates to the pCO2, total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon budgets; and (g) examine the impact of short-term ocean acidification on coccolithophore growth and calcite dissolution. <br/><br/>The research will involve cruises along the 50 S parallel to sample the Great Belt, during the austral summer. The investigators will use a combination of underway surface sampling (primarily optical and hydrographic) and vertical station profiles (using CTD/rosette and large volume submersible pumps) to address hypotheses related to the above goals. The cruise track will elucidate both zonal and meridional variability in the Great Belt. Controlled carboy incubation experiments will examine the impact of ocean acidification at various future scenarios on coccolithophore growth and dissolution. Dilution experiments will address grazing-related mortality and dissolution questions. Controlled metal-addition incubations will focus on potential iron, zinc and cobalt limitation of the coccolithophores or competition from diatoms related to silica availability. The proposed field observations and metal-addition experiments will provide important information on the current status of the Great Belt in the context of global biogeochemistry. The ocean acidification experiments to be undertaken are more forward-looking in terms of the fate of the Southern Ocean coccolithophores in a future acidified ocean. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The globally significant size of the Great Belt indicates that it likely plays a major role in global biogeochemistry and climate change feedbacks. Thus, the investigators expect this work to have broad, transformative impacts in biological and chemical oceanography. Ocean acidification from the burning of fossil fuels is predicted to lower the pH of the surface ocean by 0.3 units in the next century and up to 0.7 units - a 5-fold increase in the proton concentration by the year 2300. A major goal of this study is to examine the effects of ocean acidification on coccolithophores in a region of low calcite saturation (i.e., one of the first regions expected to become sub-saturating for calcite). The results of these experiments will therefore be highly relevant to our basic understanding of the marine carbon cycle. Related to career development and Criterion II activities, the project includes field experience on two cruises for NSF REU undergraduates from Maine universities or colleges, providing funds for them to attend a scientific meeting. Participation of undergraduate students from Maine colleges builds capacity in our rural coastal state and helps thwart the serious issue of 'brain drain', in which the best students are leaving Maine to seek opportunity in wealthier, more populated states. A teacher will also participate on the cruises (via the NSF-sponsored ARMADA program). This teacher will develop learning modules for students about such topics as coccolithophores, calcification, export production, metal-plankton interactions, ocean acidification and climate change.

The project will (1) advance the pedagogic integration of Earth and environmental sciences and related courses into a business curriculum by developing new trans-disciplinary active-learning course modules through a series of summer workshops for science and business faculty; (2) create new technology-enhanced class and laboratory activities by incorporating recent university investment in environmental and geochemical field and laboratory analytical instrumentation; and (3) assess the effectiveness of the curriculum enhancements during and following implementation of the technological innovations, multi-disciplinary course enhancements, and new active-learning course modules. The learning modules will address sustainability themes such as water resources, global climate change, environmental hazards, energy and mineral resources, and agriculture, and thus will provide a number of opportunities for interdisciplinary problem solving. Through a series of formative evaluations, the course modules will be refined and improved. Ultimately, the course modules will be made available to the larger science and business communities through educational websites. Outcomes and experiences will be communicated to the broader science and business education communities at national conferences and through educational publications. The project will not only enhance science learning and knowledge retention and improve the scientific literacy among future business leaders, but it also has the potential to increase the appreciation and understanding of science and the scientific method among business faculty, as well as to increase the appreciation of business issues among scientists.
0952571	Collaborative Research: Semantics and Pragmatics of Projective Meaning across Languages	BCS	LINGUISTICS	06/15/2010	10/03/2014	Craige Roberts	OH	Ohio State University	Standard Grant	William J. Badecker	11/30/2015	$190,484.00	Judith Tonhauser	roberts.21@osu.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	Columbus	OH	432101016	6146888735	SBE	1311	1311	$0.00	The term projection describes cases where some element of meaning unexpectedly escapes from the scope of another expression, such as a negation or conditional. For example, John didn't see his sister is typically understood as denying that there was an event of John seeing his sister, but not as denying that John has a sister -- even though syntactically the expression his sister is under the scope of the negation. An enormous range of expressions yield projection, including presupposition triggers, conventional implicature triggers, approximatives, and some inferences associated with Gricean implicatures. This project will carry out the first systematic empirical and theoretical analysis of the full range of projective meanings, to establish why projection occurs, and how subclasses of projective meaning differ. To this end, it will develop templates for diagnostic tests that can be used to study properties of projective meanings cross-linguistically, with theoretically naive consultants. The researchers will conduct detailed investigations of projective meanings in English and Paraguayan Guarani, and disseminate the techniques to fieldworkers studying other languages, through publications and workshops. <br/><br/>Modern linguistic semantics centers around Fregean compositionality, the way in which the meanings of parts are combined to give the meanings of larger expressions. While there has been great progress in compositional semantics, projective meaning does not obey ordinary compositional rules. Until now, there has been no uniform account of why projective meanings behave differently from ordinary content. This project seeks to explain projection, based on the working hypothesis that aspects of meaning project if and only if they are not at-issue. The notion of at-issueness is a pragmatic one, based on what questions are under discussion in a discourse. Thus the project will place a relatively little-studied pragmatic notion at the heart of work on linguistic meaning. A first area where the innovations in the project are of broad significance is in its cross-linguistic focus: a theory of human language cannot be based on one language alone, and the project will apply its empirical techniques cross-linguistically. Beyond linguistic semantics, the issues studied are fundamental to Philosophy of Language, since the work subtly redraws the boundary between Semantics and Pragmatics. Further the project is of practical significance in the field of Natural Language Processing (specifically, the subfield of Computational Semantics). Text processing systems, e.g. computer systems for automatically answering a user's questions, must take account of inferences which arise independently of standard composition. A question answering system which does not take account of what is projected will not be able to identify what the user already knows, and will not be able to identify what question needs to be answered.

Today, advances in digital multimedia, networking and mass storage are promising a third revolution: a movement from the study of small, individual datasets to the analysis of published corpora that are several orders of magnitude larger.<br/><br/>These new bodies of data are badly needed, to enable the field of phonetics to develop and test hypotheses across languages and across the many types of individual, social and contextual variation. However, in contrast to speech technology research, speech science has so far taken relatively little advantage of this opportunity, because access to these resources for phonetics research requires tools and methods that are now incomplete, untested, and inaccessible to most researchers.<br/><br/>This project fills this gap by integrating, adapting and improving techniques developed in speech technology research, mainly forced alignment of digital audio with phonetic representations derived from orthographic transcripts. The research will help the field of phonetics to enter a new era: conducting research using very large speech corpora, in the range from hundreds of hours to hundreds of thousands of hours.

This project will simplify this study by defining simple abstract models for Medium Access Control (MAC) layers in wireless networks. These layers will provide reliable local broadcast communication, with delays that are bounded by functions of the local contention. Algorithm designers should be able to develop and analyze algorithms in terms of these abstract layers, independently of the physical network behavior and the MAC layer implementation, yet obtain results that are realistic in terms of the physical networks. Likewise, theoreticians should be able to use these layers to prove simple but meaningful lower bounds.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project will define and evaluate several possible abstract MAC layers, varying according to whether their guarantees are worst case or probabilistic, how they model signal propagation characteristics, and what they ensure in the presence of failures and other network changes.<br/>It will demonstrate how these layers can be implemented in physical radio networks, using a variety of contention-management methods such as carrier-sensing, collision detection, random transmission and backoff, and network coding. It will use these layers to study many problems in wireless networks,<br/>including basic problems such as neighbor discovery and regional<br/>leader election; intermediate problems such as network-wide communication, maintenance of network structures, and resource allocation; and high-level problems that arise in robot control and data-management applications.

Lowering the emittance of bright electron beams is a goal in the field of accelerator physics for the realization of next generation light sources and linear colliders. Investigation of samples of varying materials and surface preparations will be carried out for the purpose of determining optimal photocathode characteristics for the production of low emittance beams. This research should also lead to an evaluation of potential surface preparation techniques, such as thin film or atomic layer deposition, for use in control of emission properties. Another goal of the research is to aid in design optimization of the Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectrometer (ARPES), which is being developed for intrinsic emission measurements at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). This research has been designated by the Physics Division as Potentially Transformative Research. It is challenging in nature yet the results could have major worldwide effects on accelerator design. Broader impacts include education and impacts on other fields of research. The research proposed would also provide opportunities for students at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) to become involved with a research effort at Argonne National Laboratory, while allowing them to work on contributions to the project in an IIT laboratory. The application oriented nature of this research can help cross the boundary between basic research and technological advance. Better light sources will advance research in medicine, geology, environmental science, and the biological, chemical and physical sciences.

With this grant, we will acquire a state of the art wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer to replace the 17-year-old instrument in the Department of Geological Sciences at Brigham Young University.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The major and trace element compositions of rocks provide fundamental clues to their origin and evolution and are vital to most modern geological studies. Such data are commonly acquired by students using XRF spectrometry because of its relative ease of use and high precision for many elements. Specific research areas include the nature and causes of super eruptions, the evolution of mafic magmas related to hot spots and rifts, the relationship of magmatism to base and precious metal deposits, the geochemistry and chronology of tuff deposits in sedimentary basins, and the growth of continents as revealed by multi-disciplinary studies of the tectonic evolution of southern Asia, New England, and western North America.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The benefits to society stemming from use of this instrument range from purely scientific understandings of magma evolution to the applied fields of volcanic hazards and the search of metallic ore deposits. A new XRF spectrometer will also provide extensive education opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students; they will be trained as part of the next generation of analysts. By doing their own analyses and not just ?sending samples off? to an external lab, students will be able to understand the limitations of the data because they have personally dealt with analytical problems, sample preparation issues, and with the sources of error in their data. This XRF lab will also have major impacts on education and research beyond BYU, as a result of our collaboration with other colleges and with the Utah Geological Surve, and USGS. Two of these institutions recently changed from junior colleges to BS granting universities with geology degrees. Few analytical instruments are available in these emerging programs, so access to this facility will provide new experiences for students at these colleges.

The flow of water masses between the Bering Sea and the Arctic and Pacific oceans, changes in Arctic ice volume, and whether dense intermediate waters formed in the Pacific during this time will be investigated as some of the possible triggers of past climate change. The high resolution sediment records obtained from this cruise, with relatively large-amplitude signals, provide a unique opportunity to understand how insulation changes in the upper atmosphere propagate through the climate system and to further test if the orbital cycles of climate change primarily operate on 23ky versus 40 ky timescales. This study utilizes K % logging data from the cruise with paleomagnetic, sedimentological (eg., grain size analysis) and paleontological (eg., analysis of microfossil assemblages; d18O and d13C measurements of benthic and planktonic forams) measurements from the drill cores. The information expected from this study is critical for understanding the fundamental drivers and feedbacks between ice sheets, oceanic and atmospheric circulation and the global carbon cycle. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project significantly advances large investments previously made in an important IODP expedition. The data derived from this investigation can provide important information for paleoclimate/ocean models, and is relevant towards projections of future climate under IPCC AR4 scenarios. The project includes a team of early and mid-career scientists, and includes international collaborations with other scientists of the IODP community. Support is also provided for undergraduate and graduate education, and for public outreach and education.
0961830	Collaborative Research: A mechanistic understanding of biogeographic patterns and life histories in benthic organisms in advective coastal environments	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	06/15/2010	06/15/2010	James Byers	GA	University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc	Standard Grant	David L.

Contributing factors are offspring of species with planktonic larvae being physically transported outside their natal range, and adults thriving when transplanted into regions immediately beyond their natural distributions. It is unclear, however, why long-distance dispersal of a benthic organism's larva should persist on evolutionary timescales. There is more larval dispersal from natal habitat than would seem propitious. Furthermore, long larval duration is known to increase reproductive output for species persistence, makes population retention of favorable alleles less likely, and reduces the genetic diversity of the population.<br/><br/>The Co-PIs have shown that maintenance of range boundaries for a species are governed by a function analogous to that derived for allelic frequency/genetic clines in the coastal ocean. As with other recent advances in biodiversity theory, this work suggests a convergence between conditions that maintain the distribution of alleles within species and those that maintain the distribution of species themselves. This confluence of theory provides substantial opportunity for development of inter- and intra-species competition in an advective environment. It potentially would unify genetic and population-level theory, and create a holistic view of life in advective environs. <br/><br/>It is clear from preliminary work that a synthesis would depend critically on tradeoffs between dispersal mode and successful reproductive output. The theory would be developed both by pushing its analytical envelope, and by drawing upon extensive, existing databases to quantitatively constrain reproductive and dispersal tradeoffs. For example, although tradeoffs between larval quantity versus quality (i.e., many energetically cheap larvae versus few highly provisioned individuals) have long been the subject of qualitative models, they have not been quantitatively defined for life history characteristics of different benthic marine taxa. Combining analytical developments and observed life-history tradeoffs would provide 1) evolutionarily stable states for a range of dispersal strategies, 2) mechanisms that define species boundaries as a function of physical (e.g., temperature and alongshore variation in currents) and biological (like larval mortality) parameters and 3) quantitative origins of dispersal behaviors that would locally retain larvae, and result in relationships between inter- and intra-species fitness. <br/><br/>Such findings would predict species boundary locations and the presence/absence of various dispersal strategies as a function of local circulation, environmental conditions and their gradients. Predictions would be tested against data on species ranges gathered as part of an extensive literature and database search. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: This research would allow a better mechanistic understanding species' ranges that occur due to changes in the Earth's climate. For example, this study will test the hypothesis that warming favors species with longer larval planktonic duration. Therefore, high-latitude areas now dominated by species with direct development would shift to a mixture of planktonic dispersers and direct developers as the climate warms. The research would allow managers to understand how disruption to habitat can alter species ranges by changing alongshore sources and transport of planktonic larvae. A quantitative theory of species range will also help managers understand what sets the ultimate limits of recently introduced exotic species, allowing improvement of management strategies. This proposal includes the following education components. Two graduate students will be trained in cutting-edge techniques in the fields of quantitative phylogeography and biogeography. In addition, two undergraduate students each year will assist with all aspects of the project and will present their work at a national meeting. The students will be mentored to write REU proposals to NSF. Undergraduates will be recruited with the help of the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, of which UGA is a flagship member. Undergraduates will also be recruited from the Research and Discovery Program at UNH, from colleges with limited opportunities for undergraduate research.

This requires defining a measure of fitness that the network optimizes and showing that mutation rates (which are unknown) to not bias the result. Darwin understood that complex organs such as the eye could evolve by continual small changes if all the intermediate steps increased the fitness. The same question will be posed for networks and answered computationally: what networks can be learned by gradient ascent (ie hill climbing). When evolution proceeds by hill climbing, the same local maxima are found irrespective of mutation rates. Generic fitness measures for embryonic patterning and the input-output response of signaling systems are suggested that may capture the phyla-wide properties of developmental networks. In situations where the network produces a static pattern, bifurcation theory enumerates the types of patterns that occur as parameters change continuously. Near the bifurcation point there are simple polynomial equations that collapse many physical variables into a few, and thus provide a description of the system with as few parameters as mathematics allows. Geometric models with fixed points, saddle points and sources may be an effective way to quantitatively model biological networks, and possibly evolution itself. A complementary experimental program will time cell divisions and other markers during embryonic development in the worm C.elegans to see if their fluctuations conform to geometric models. To see whether the structure of developmental signaling pathways can be understood from their input-output response, TGF-beta pathway in Xenopus will be probed with time and space dependent stimuli and time-lapsed imaged in sheets of embryonic cells. Students and postdocs will be engaged in research projects related to this proposal.

They also represent a significant natural hazard. This project is concerned with fundamental questions regarding eruptive systems: Why do some silicic magmas erupt while others stall in the subsurface? Why do some magmas erupt effusively (i.e. as lava flows) while others do so explosively? Are these different magmas that are predestined to different eruptive potential and style, or are they similar magmas subject to different contingencies? Much attention has been given to the importance of external triggers (e.g. earthquakes) in initiating eruptions. Many lines of evidence suggest, however, that eruption triggers are only effective to the extent that a magma body is already primed to the point where eruption is already very likely or inevitable. The fundamental question that this project aims to address is what is the path for priming of a magmatic body? The project will explore the importance of the internal evolution (i.e. crystallization, bubble formation, and magma evolution) of silicic magmas to eruptive potential, and in particular, to explosive potential. A combination of thermodynamic and fluid dynamics modeling will be employed, using selected natural systems as inspiration and guides to exploring the parameter space of the models. While the research being conducted is academic in nature, it will help further the understanding of the eruptive potential of magmatic systems, and may eventually help volcanologists concerned with systems that directly affect society.<br/><br/>As part of this project, a thermodynamic model that can appropriately describe the evolution of high-silica systems will be developed, and it will be coupled with new and existing models of the dynamics of the chamber itself and of its walls. Modeling tools developed under this project will be made available to the scientific community as standalone software, web services, and browser-based web clients that will permit users to apply these tools to their own scientific questions and teaching needs. Natural systems to be studied include the Bishop Tuff (CA), Peach Spring Tuff (AZ-NV-CA), and the Highland Range Volcanics (NV), taking advantage of their unique magmatic and eruptive histories to assess some of the first order controls on the eruptive potential of silicic magmas.

Managed savings (government or employer defined benefit plans) have given way to individually directed savings (defined contribution plans). A growing body of lab - and to a lesser extent field - evidence in behavioral finance raises concerns over this trend, arguing that individual investors are ill informed or even biased in their investment choices. Examples range from owning too much employer stock to using heuristics such as naive diversification. Many argue, however, that biased investors can still make good investments choices because intermediaries like financial advisors will help to undo their biases. In fact, 67% of US households owning equities or bonds consulted with a least one advisor between 2003 and 2008. Little is known, however, how this market for financial advice functions and whether it indeed leads to the desired outcomes for investors. The PI's propose two experiments to examine the supply and demand sides of the financial advice market. The first experiment uses an audit study methodology, novel to finance. Trained auditors visit advisors posing as clients. Different (randomly assigned) treatments capture a number of investor biases: auditors vary both in the portfolios they present and the investment strategies they initially espouse to advisors. Outcome measures include the nature of advice that is given and attempts to de-bias clients. The treatments further allow the PI's to test advisor moral hazard; do they de-bias only when it leads to greater fees. Before the financial crisis, the PI's conducted a medium scale pilot that showed the feasibility of this approach as well as interesting results about advisors? selective de-biasing. The second experiment analyzes how, in the lab, investors assess advisor quality. Subjects see videos featuring financial advice from different advisors. The advice is randomly matched to advisors and varies in the extent to which it caters to biases, maximizes fee income or represents high quality advice. Subjects are asked to rate the quality of the advisor and the advice. The sample of test subjects will be drawn from a representative cross section of people in the adult working population; across different demographic subgroups, such as age, income, education and genders. The PI's have secured consent from several large employers in the Boston area to sign up some of their employees for the study.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Together these studies will present some of the first data on this very important market. The PI's will collect quantitative data on a question that has only been discussed in the abstract. They use novel methods and random assignment to allow for causal inference and provide conceptual insights into the forces that shape the market for financial advice. For example, do investors provide market discipline for advisors? Could fee-income distort advisors? Answers to these questions will provide an important empirical basis for future theorizing and empirical on the market for financial advice.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>A better understanding of how individuals invest their money has broad implications. Financial academics and regulators struggle to understand if and how behavioral biases affect market prices (as the recent debate on noise trader models in asset pricing highlights). Macroeconomists struggle to produce accurate models of individual consumption and investment. These debates have consequences for regulatory policy broadly construed. Shedding light on them can therefore impact a variety of areas. The results will also have immediate implications for regulating investor choices (e.g. disclosure) and the market for advice specifically. The financial crisis has renewed interest in designing smarter regulation of consumer finance products and the market for financial advice in the US and around the world. A firm empirical understanding of this and any potential market failure is essential in designing better regulation. Regulation would take a very different form if catering to investors' biased beliefs was the main problem rather than fee induced moral hazard of advisors.

Vascular plant, moss, lichen, and fungal specimens will be included in the project. Once digitized, we will place these records online for the public through an existing Web portal (http://www.pnwherbaria.org). We are leveraging the cyberinfrastructure (e.g., Ethernet, servers, technical staff) available at several large universities to build partnerships with smaller institutions that otherwise would not have the resources to undertake this activity.<br/><br/>Our project provides tangible benefits to the general public, undergraduate students, and the research community. Digitizing specimens and making them available online creates public access to collections that have been assembled in part through prior federal funding. The specimen data will be downloadable from the Web site, so anyone can use the information to pursue unique interests and questions. Undergraduate students will be involved extensively with imaging and data basing activities, providing them with skills and training applicable to future professional pursuits. Online availability of nearly 2 million Pacific Northwest herbarium specimens will increase access and efficiency for the research community using these collections.

McFarlane, Claremont McKenna College<br/>EAR - 0952398<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/> Gunung Mulu National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia, was established in 1974 to protect its world-class subterranean environment, and recognized for World Heritage status in 2000. Currently, this heritage incorporates some 295 kms of mapped cave, including some of the largest passages and chambers in the World. This proposal focuses on resolving the age and origin of a prominent volcanic ash layer preserved in the sediment deposits of several Mulu caves, on using that distinctive chrono-marker to understand the depositional history of the caves, and on isolating a concurrent geochemical signature in Mulu speleothems.<br/>PIs believe that the circumstantial evidence points to the ash layer being formed by the Younger Toba eruption - a cataclysmic event originating in northern Sumatra that is recognized as the most violent volcanic event in the past million years of Earth history. If the Mulu ash does prove to come from Toba, it will provide valuable new insights into the pattern of ash-fall and hence it's probable impact on ecosystems and human populations in southeast Asia. If the ash proves to originate elsewhere, then it must represent a hitherto unrecognized eruption of great significance. In either case, identifying a corresponding geochemical signature in a dated Mulu stalagmite may lay the groundwork for developing paleo-eruption records from speleothems Southeast Asia.

Until now the firm dogma is that all IGB rocks would be highly metamorphosed and therefore information on Earth?s oldest paleoenvironment and the origin of life would be erased or so strongly masked that no firm conclusions can be drawn. This proposed project would open a new perspective by demonstrating that the IGB constitutes a valuable archive on Earth?s deepest time, and that it requires only newly developed methods to read this unique information.<br/>Indeed, the preliminary work of the PI?s working group points to the possibility that in the IGB already diverse marine paleoenvironments including a tidal, a shelf, and a deep ocean setting, existed. The team has developed a new method to distinguish any type of primary cyclicity in the meta-sediments (tidal and Milancovic cyclicity). Based on those preliminary yet stunning results, PI would like to conduct an exploratory study on those unique rock successions, and to gain appropriate data to confirm our initial observations on photos. The results are not conforming to the current status quo of knowledge of the scientific community. <br/>Noffke would travel from Washington, DC to Copenhagen and from there to Nuuk, Greenland. From here, they would be transported by helicopter to the study area itself. The trip should take place from mid of July to mid of August 2010. This is the best window with respect to the local weather in Greenland (the arctic summer). <br/>PI would visit three outcrops in the IGB. The locations are known exactly from GPS data. She would measure the rock successions with respect to the tidal and Milancovic cyclicities that she has detected in photo scans. In addition, she would conduct structural geological measurements in the field to gain an overview into the tectonic frame of each setting. This would allow her to later understand textural structures in thin-sections, and to diagnose, if apparent bedding, sedimentary structures such as ripple cross stratification, are of tectonic, metamorphic or indeed primary origin. <br/>The team would camp for 2 weeks in the field close to the inland ice. The rock samples would be shipped by GEUS from Isua to Norfolk, Virginia. They would return again by helicopter via the Survey base camp, and then travel back to the USA. The field data on the type and thickness of the bedding at all 3 locations will be used for spectral analyses.

It is produced as very cold, dense water formed over the Antarctic continental shelves sinks down the continental slope as a density outflow, entraining ambient deep-ocean water masses as it descends. There has been recent progress in understanding the dynamics and modeling other major density currents, notably those in the Nordic and marginal seas. However, less progress has been made in understanding Antarctic density flows, hampered primarily by a lack of detailed field data. As a consequence we do not, at this time, have a clear answer to two following fundamental questions: What is the relative importance of processes believed to determine the production rate and hydrographic characteristics of AABW at the primary formation sites around Antarctica? Why do Antarctic outflows retain sufficient density contrast to sink to the deep ocean floor, whereas most other outflows entrain sufficiently vigorously to reach neutral density at intermediate depths?<br/><br/>Based on an extensive profile and mooring data set obtained in and around an energetic density outflow during the Antarctic Slope (AnSlope) field program in 2003-2005 in the NW Ross Sea, the investigators have defined a numerical modeling study that can address the above questions. Analyses of the field data, and exploratory modeling efforts, suggest that Antarctic outflows are significantly impacted by the following factors: (1) small-scale (sub-Rossby radius) topographic variability (corrugations, isobath convergence, continental slope curvature, steep slopes); (2) nonlinear interaction of the outflow with cross-slope advection and mixing associated with 'independent' energetic processes such as tides; and (3) nonlinear equation-of-state effects, notably thermobaricity. An extensive set of numerical studies using a spectral element Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model will be carried out to study the sensitivity of outflow dynamics and AABW production to these factors. The models will be guided by Antarctic field data (AnSlope, and complementary programs in the southern Weddell Sea), but will be applied to idealized topographies and hydrographic fields. We will develop parameterizations of Antarctic density outflows and AABW production rates, and test these within the framework of coarser-resolution regional ocean models using Regional Ocean Modeling Sysytem. The study will address the overarching objective of improving the representation of AABW formation in climate system models.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merits: This project is the first known application of an LES model to the climatologically significant problem of global bottom water formation around Antarctica. We will use this tool to quantify the relative importance of the principal factors influencing the production rate and properties of AABW over parameter ranges that cover the major Antarctic outflows. Outcomes will be compared and contrasted with outflows elsewhere in the world ocean.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The parameterizations that we will develop will improve our ability to simulate AABW production in earth climate system models that cannot resolve the small spatial and temporal scales of the outflow and its entrainment processes. AABW is a critical component of the meridional overturning circulation and is the dominant contributor to ventilation of the global deep ocean. One graduate student will be supported at RSMAS/UM by this grant. The Earth and Space Research (ESR) Co-investigator will continue to provide scientific oversight for a Western Oregon University grant to develop K-12 curricula and educate teachers in climate science. Presentations will be given at annual training workshops, and Oregon and National Science Teacher Association meetings. Both ESR and the University of Miami maintain specific web pages focused on education and outreach.

Often we are unaware of how we use our eyes to help us see and move better, because the way we coordinate our eye and hand movements is so dynamic and flexible. During coordination, many areas of the brain become active, and models predict that different areas in the brain must communicate with each other in order to coordinate our eye and hand movements. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Bijan Pesaran is pursuing two major research goals that develop eye-hand coordination as a model for understanding how brain areas work together during cognition. Flexible communication between different brain areas is fundamentally important to a wide range of cognitive processes but very little is known about how brain areas talk to each other to guide our behavior. The experiments carried out under this project investigate how the coupling between coordinated eye-hand behaviors depends on cooperation and inhibition between visual saccade and reach representations. In one set of experiments, Dr. Pesaran is examining how cooperation between reaches and saccades leads to a common stage of target selection before coordinated movements. In a second set of experiments, Dr. Pesaran is examining how during reaching, the selection of new eye movements is inhibited by reaching. Inhibition slows down new eye movements, so that they occur after the reach movement is finished. <br/><br/>Eye-hand coordination involves high-level cognitive processes, and understanding coordination can serve as an important model for understanding how brain systems interact to carry out cognitive processes in general. The interdisciplinary research program also inspires an integrated educational plan to increase awareness of neuroscience amongst students and increase the use of quantitative tools in neuroscience research. An increase in the level of quantitative and statistical sophistication is a hallmark of the next generation of brain scientists. This increase is needed to successfully tackle challenging research questions about how brain areas cooperate to guide behavior. Outreach to increase awareness of neuroscience is extending beyond the university curriculum into K-12 programs. Dr. Pesaran is demonstrating neuroscience concepts in a school outreach program in public schools. The educational outreach program aims to improve awareness of neuroscience amongst school children and encourage them to explore neuroscience educational opportunities in the future.

They also represent a significant natural hazard. This project is concerned with fundamental questions regarding eruptive systems: Why do some silicic magmas erupt while others stall in the subsurface? Why do some magmas erupt effusively (i.e. as lava flows) while others do so explosively? Are these different magmas that are predestined to different eruptive potential and style, or are they similar magmas subject to different contingencies? Much attention has been given to the importance of external triggers (e.g. earthquakes) in initiating eruptions. Many lines of evidence suggest, however, that eruption triggers are only effective to the extent that a magma body is already primed to the point where eruption is already very likely or inevitable. The fundamental question that this project aims to address is what is the path for priming of a magmatic body? The project will explore the importance of the internal evolution (i.e. crystallization, bubble formation, and magma evolution) of silicic magmas to eruptive potential, and in particular, to explosive potential. A combination of thermodynamic and fluid dynamics modeling will be employed, using selected natural systems as inspiration and guides to exploring the parameter space of the models. While the research being conducted is academic in nature, it will help further the understanding of the eruptive potential of magmatic systems, and may eventually help volcanologists concerned with systems that directly affect society.<br/><br/>As part of this project, a thermodynamic model that can appropriately describe the evolution of high-silica systems will be developed, and it will be coupled with new and existing models of the dynamics of the chamber itself and of its walls. Modeling tools developed under this project will be made available to the scientific community as standalone software, web services, and browser-based web clients that will permit users to apply these tools to their own scientific questions and teaching needs. Natural systems to be studied include the Bishop Tuff (CA), Peach Spring Tuff (AZ-NV-CA), and the Highland Range Volcanics (NV), taking advantage of their unique magmatic and eruptive histories to assess some of the first order controls on the eruptive potential of silicic magmas.

This is a critical knowledge gap for models used to estimate long-term climate change impacts on both the biosphere and the rate of change of CO2 in the atmosphere. A pilot study, based on large databases from more than 100 observational sites over 6 continents with a total of 583 site-years of observations, suggests that the net flow of carbon into or out of ecosystems is highly correlated with: (1) mean annual temperature at mid- and high-latitudes, (2) water stress at mid- and low-latitudes, and (3) both temperature and water stress around the mid-latitudinal belt. On average, the influence of water stress on terrestrial ecosystem CO2 uptake exceeds the influence of temperature at mean annual temperatures above 16 C. This project will explore the ecological and physical mechanisms behind these initial results and develop a clearer understanding of the relative importance of temperature and water availability on carbon sequestration. This research is essential to understanding how future climate change is likely to alter the exchange of CO2 between the biosphere and the atmosphere.<br/><br/> The consensus of science represented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that over the 21st century warming will be greatest at high northern latitudes, while projected decreases in precipitation are likely over much of the terrestrial subtropical zone. Results of this project will provide an empirical model based on real-world data of how the most likely future climate change scenarios would affect the potential capacity of terrestrial CO2 uptake in high latitudes and low latitudes. The analysis and synthesis of information proposed here is based on a large dataset provided by more than 100 research groups around the world. Collaboration, communication, and co-authorship will be established among a large number of scientists who collect these data. Two lectures will be developed for a non-major course that serves >250 students, and will incorporate basic concepts of physiological ecology and climatology based on this research. The lectures will bring current research into a classroom with perhaps the most ethnically diverse student body in the nation.

The project aims to improve our understanding of housing market externalities, the direct and indirect effects of price controls, and to take advantage of a unique policy experiment to explore core issues in urban economics such as the evolution of neighborhoods and the capitalization of amenities.<br/><br/>Several components of the project exploit a rich new data set on rent regulation in Cambridge MA. The data set includes the precise location for all rent controlled units in Cambridge until 1995, when a statewide referendum eliminated rent control. We link the data set to all housing market transactions in Cambridge and surrounding communities, building permitting activity, data from the City Census, which includes the identity, age and occupation of more than 80% of residents, and information on the credit profile of residents aggregated at a fine geographic level specific to rent controlled and non-rent controlled groups. The project investigates the impact of the elimination of rent control on the prices of uncontrolled condominiums, single and multi-family housing. Preliminary analysis suggests that there is a substantial impact of the elimination of rent control on the prices of uncontrolled houses in neighborhoods with large amounts of pre-existing rent controlled units. We will carry out further analyses of the database to explore the reasons for the price change. One mechanism involves changes in the level of building permitting activity due to investment complementarities between units, while the second involves measuring changes in the allocation of individuals to housing after the elimination of rent control. Additional empirical work will examine the direct impacts of the end of rent regulation. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The project documents previously unknown facts about the nature and extent of spillovers in the housing market. It includes the development of new databases which allow for understanding various mechanisms which generate the spillovers. It raises new questions about measuring the welfare costs of price controls.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>Regulations affecting housing markets are widespread and are often predicated on the existence of spillovers. An improved understanding of the underlying forces generating spillovers in housing can help shape policies which influence housing investment and subsidies. Moreover, price controls are present in many segments of the economy and an important aspect of these controls are the effects they have on uncontrolled sectors of the market. Finally, rent control is often considered a textbook example of how price controls affect the functioning of supply and demand. The detailed nature of our dataset allows for aspects of this research to be integrated into teaching. The project will also support graduate students.

The award supports work by Professor Syun-Ru Yeh at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to carry out comparative studies of five novel hemoglobins from three microorganisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli. Although hemoglobins are commonly perceived as oxygen carriers, the target globins have been implicated in defense mechanisms against nitric oxide, a key bactericidal agent of the innate host immune system, by utilizing molecular oxygen. The objective of this project is to determine the functional properties of these intriguing oxygen-utilizing globins and to define the mechanism by which these properties are dictated by the protein matrix housing the prosthetic heme group in each globin. To achieve the goal, a complementary set of spectroscopic and rapid-kinetic techniques, combined with biochemical and computational methodologies will be developed and employed in an iterative fashion. The successful completion of this project will better define the physiological roles and functional mechanisms of the bacterial globins that is lacking in the field, thereby advancing fundamental knowledge in the structure-function relationships of heme-proteins. The knowledge thus derived will offer valuable guidelines for the design of efficient blood substitutes carrying molecular oxygen or competent artificial enzymes performing oxygen chemistry for pharmaceutical applications. The multifaceted approach is expected to provide unique training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, thereby enhancing the PI's continuing efforts in recruiting, educating and mentoring young scientists, especially women and under-represented minorities.

Methods for the analysis of massive SNS graphs using signal processing and information-theoretic techniques are being designed to answer fundamental questions regarding SNS. The goal is to develop new approaches for (i) identifying influential nodes in SNS networks, and understanding how these nodes evolve and interact over time, (ii) inferring people?s social graphs from SNS graphs, and (iii) inferring properties of an SNS network from analyzing another SNS graph. To achieve these objectives, signal-processing inspired and information/graph theoretic approaches are being employed for: (a) projecting information contained in massive SNS graphs onto compact representations; and (b) understanding how different graphs (e.g., representing different time-instances of a social network service or representing different services) relate to each other.<br/><br/>This research enables a spectrum of novel applications that are currently impossible. A deeper understanding of the structure of social networks and how that structure evolves can be applied to a variety of social issues. The project is interdisciplinary in nature and it bridges several different communities including electrical engineering, computer science, and social science; and it fosters interaction and communication among them. To promote education and learning, this project actively engages high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, especially students from under-represented minorities.

The project builds on the core strengths of the NHMLAC's dynamic programs in paleontology and evolutionary biology, extensive reference collections, and broad experience in the education of scientific discovery, and uses the appeal of dinosaurs and other Mesozoic vertebrates to increase the interest and enhance the education of students of Hispanic background in vertebrate paleontology. Students are being recruited from the culturally and ethnically diverse metropolitan area of Los Angeles for a year of research, data collection, analysis, and public presentation of results. Research activities and workshops will be designed to explore a diversity of topics germane to the study of vertebrate fossils and careers within the geosciences. A series of comprehensive workshops and the opportunity to participate in weekly seminars will supplement the research activities of the participants. A two-week field trip to dinosaur localities of the American West will provide students with hands-on experience about how fossils are discovered and collected, and expose them to the fundamentals of field research (e.g., stratigraphy, GPS navigation, data collection). This project will expose 6 participating students to a wide range of academic activities as well as career and schooling options within the geosciences, encourage them to transfer to a 4-year college and to continue onto graduate studies, and increase their understanding about the nature of science, particularly as applied to paleontology and evolution. This award provides a 1-year extension of activities initiated through a previous Track 1 OEDG project (GEO-0703506).

Mixing by internal waves is thought to be a primary mechanism governing the overall thermohaline structure of the oceans, and may have significant implications for climate variability. The project promises to reduce the uncertainty in climate prediction associated with the smallest scale physical processes that cannot be explicitly solved by climate models. The project will address three aspects of ocean mixing: near field mixing at internal wave generation sites, mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy transported in the wave field, and far field mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy away from sources. Parameterizations will be based on data-based relations for wave physics, radiation balance theory, and results from process models. In addition to be being based on sound theoretical ideas, the parameterizations will also be based on observational results from the growing data set of microstructure observations.

This has resulted in a growing database of ADCP transects, especially in the region of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Combined with other hydrographic data (e.g. XBT/ XCTD data, drifter tracks, some limited moorings) this current velocity data will be used for further analysis of the physical circulation in this ecologically and climatically sensitive region of the Southern Ocean. Processes including inter-annual and spatial variability of WAP shelf-edge and cross-shelf transport, the effects of tides, circulation controls upon sea-ice formation and associated Antarctic ecosystems (e.g. krill) are some of the key circulation features that may be more accurately inferred from these combined data sets. <br/><br/>This study will support the development of a graduate student in descriptive physical oceanography, and introduce undergraduate students to quantitative scientific analysis.

The teeth, jaws, and muscles, are the proximal interface between primates and their environments. Therefore, understanding the evolutionary forces that shape those components is essential to understanding the adaptation and evolution of primates. This work tests hypotheses and models relating diversity in the primate feeding system to size-related changes in food intake rate. It documents how shape and movements of the mandible, the size and architecture of the jaw muscles, and the amount of food an animal eats in a single bite change with body size to meet size-required changes in food intake rate of primates. These data will be collected using computed tomography (CT) scanning of primate mandibles, anatomical studies of primate chewing muscles, and behavioral studies of primates feeding in captivity. Mathematical models of the feeding system will be tested, modified and improved, then used to examine how feeding system designs in different evolutionary groups of primates balance trade-offs between advantages of bite force production, chewing speed and gape. <br/><br/>This research will create novel and important data sets that can be accessed in the future by other researchers interested in feeding biomechanics, bone biomechanics, and musculoskeletal systems in general. The investigators will continue to recruit under-represented minority and female undergraduates to receive training and mentoring in research and advice on their paths to graduate, medical, and other professional schools. These students will collaborate in all aspects of the work, including presentation and publication. The PIs will continue their outreach programs to local schools and their synergistic activities with other NSF-funded projects.

Elekonich	12/31/2012	$16,838.00		j.fewell@asu.edu	ORSPA	TEMPE	AZ	852816011	4809655479	BIO	7659	1228, 9179, 9183, 	$0.00	Biomimicry is the practice of imitating nature's forms and processes to more effectively and sustainably meet human design challenges. The conference, Social Biomimicry: Insect Societies and Human Design, will explore how social insects such as ants, bees, and termites can inform human design. Over millions of years, the social insects have evolved tightly integrated societies rivaled only by humans in their scope and sophistication. Individual social insect workers are relatively simple in their behavioral capabilities, but through their collective behavior they have solved many practical problems inherent in large social groups organizing and communicating around common goals. Already, computer models based on ant foraging behavior are being used to route traffic in busy communications networks such as the Internet, and architects are mimicking termite mounds to build passively-cooled buildings that save energy. However, the implementation of social-insect-inspired design has been limited, in part, by lack of communication and coordination across disciplinary and professional boundaries. The conference will address this shortcoming by bringing together biologists - including leaders in the field of social insect biology and complexity theory - with designers, engineers, and businesspeople, with the goal of promoting the exchange of concepts, perspectives, and tools. This activity should (1) enrich biology, by revealing new applications of basic research and stimulating new areas of problem-driven research, and (2) advance the field of biomimicry, which is an important engine for innovation and economic growth. The conference also features a public Social Insect Science EXPO! which will connect researchers at Arizona State University with members of the Phoenix community, including underrepresented students from local K-12 schools. The conference is organized and led by a panel of graduate students from ASU's Social Insect Research Group, and encourages participation by undergraduate and graduate students from the U.S. and abroad. The conference provides a unique opportunity in training future scientists with the leadership skills necessary to organize and run a professional meeting and to communicate and apply their work in an interdisciplinary context. Conference results will be disseminated broadly through peer-reviewed and popular articles and Internet resources.
0963946	CIF: Medium: Collaborative Research: From Retroactivity to Modularity: Design and Implementation of a Genetic Insulation Device in Yeast	CCF	COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY	10/01/2010	06/04/2010	Domitilla Del Vecchio	MI	University of Michigan Ann Arbor	Continuing grant	Mitra Basu	10/31/2010	$331,875.00		ddv@mit.edu	3003 South State St. Room 1062	Ann Arbor	MI	481091274	7347636438	CSE	7931	9218, HPCC	$0.00	From Retroactivity to Modularity:<br/>Design and Implementation of a Genetic Insulation Device in Yeast<br/>Domitilla Del Vecchio and Ron Weiss<br/><br/>Modularity is an important property of engineered systems, yet it is debatable whether it is a general property of natural bio-molecular systems. Discovering the extent of modularity and understanding its mechanisms is one of the most important open research problems in systems biology. Furthermore, the long term success of synthetic biology critically depends on the ability to implement modular systems in such a way that the properties of individual components do not change unpredictably upon their interconnection. Our proposed research seeks to understand the mechanisms of modularity in regulatory networks using a combined theoretical/experimental effort through the design, implementation, and analysis of a special genetic retroactivity insulation device in yeast. This novel device effectively decouples transcriptional components that would otherwise be highly interlocked by allowing propagation of a regulatory signal in the forward direction while minimizing the undesired phenomena of retroactivity in the reverse direction. Besides providing an important new circuit element for synthetic biologists, the mathematical analysis of an insulating device will lead to an improved understanding of the extent to which modularity is present in regulatory networks in biological systems. The first aim of our research is to show that retroactivity affects regulatory networks without insulation and therefore that modularity is not a natural property of bio-molecular signaling pathways. Second, we will demonstrate a novel insulation device that counteracts retroactivity and allows a circuit to transmit information reliably despite loading from downstream clients. This special circuit will be designed and placed between two connected components to insulate them from retroactivity effects. We will study the device?s performance, ability to regulate many copies of a downstream component, and requirements for correct operation. Third, we will study how well the insulation device is decoupled from the cellular environment. To this end, we will perform system-level analysis and investigate crosstalk between the device and various important cellular processes.<br/> Intellectual Merit: Existing synthetic circuits lack an ability to insulate a driving input signal from retroactivity of the output load, precluding modular composition of complex biocircuits. To address this problem, we propose to construct and characterize a synthetic phosphorylation-based insulation device and instrumentation pathway that will demonstrate a general and modular technique for building sophisticated, large scale biological systems. Our novel technique leverages the integration of special rapid feedback mechanisms into biocircuits in order to create insulation devices, and hence has implications for the design and implementation of many other biological motifs and networks. Our research includes new theoretical and computational analysis of devices with feedback and retroactivity, and these new tools will also be applicable for the study of biological network problems other than retroactivity. This analysis is fundamentally important for tuning and characterizing desired insulation properties while minimizing interference with other cellular processes.<br/> Broader Impact: In synthetic biology, this research will lead to a general understanding of the engineering principles of modularity for bio-molecular systems design. Likewise, in systems biology, this research will address a fundamental question ? To what extent is modularity an inherent property of biological systems? The product of our collaborative efforts will lead to the discovery in natural systems of motifs similar to our insulation device and to the explanation of how modularity is achieved, including insight into when and where natural systems implement modularity and for what purposes. Ultimately, the resulting capability of modular composition to achieve defined engineering goals in biological systems will have tremendous impact on human therapeutics, including regenerative medicine, diabetes, and cancer therapy, as well as in other diverse areas, including biofuel production, environmental remediation, pharmaceutical production, and biosensing applications. This research will contribute to new interdisciplinary courses and will be integrated into a ten week undergraduate synthetic biology Summer program that culminates in an international competition and has a track record of attracting women, under-represented groups, and high schools students to the field.

Such information will allow calculation of intermediate/deep water mass mixing ratios in areas of active advection (e.g., the Atlantic), and when combined with radiocarbon dating will yield ventilation rates, which are thought to be an important control on atmospheric CO2. Past nutrient distributions can also yield information about productivity and remineralization in areas of more sluggish circulation. This award supports refinement and application of paleo-proxies for the nutrient phosphate (P/Ca) and the quasi-nutrient barium (Ba/Ca) in the solitary deep-sea coral D. dianthus. The research will produce a regional proxy calibration for the Southern Ocean using live-collected corals, and will then analyze fossil specimens to determine the evolution of endmember Southern source water nutrient content since the Last Glacial Maximum. They will also reconstruct the history of nutrient concentrations at mid to deep water depths in the NW Atlantic over the past 30ky using dated fossil corals from the New England seamounts. The research will provide a new, quantitative assessment of nutrient distribution in the past ocean. This work is part of a larger collaborative effort involving scientists from CalTech and Imperial College, London, who will provide both sample material and complementary data. Broader impacts include funding of a female PhD student as well as outreach efforts in association with the well-established COSEE (Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence) program at Rutgers University.

The software, called Divvy, will provide parallel visualization of multiple dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques, flexible domain knowledge integration, customizable exemplar and outlier visualization, and dynamic indicators of cluster quality using theoretically sound cluster quality measures.  Divvy will leverage recent advances in parallel and graphics processing unit computing in order to deliver near real-time calculation of partitions on many datasets.  Divvy also will be used as a platform for psychophysical studies that investigate the role and behavior of human researchers in the data-analysis process.<br/><br/>Machine learning techniques are increasingly essential for scientific analysis in many different fields.  As datasets increase in size and dimensionality, scientists need access to tools that can help them quickly and easily perform exploratory data analysis and visualization.  Divvy will allow a user to rapidly interact with and visualize the results of many different dimensionality-reduction and clustering algorithms through an intuitive interface.  By collecting a broad set of cutting-edge machine-learning tools in one user-friendly interface, Divvy will enable substantial improvements in data analysis methodology for researchers outside of machine learning and related fields.  This project will support workshops and tutorials at conferences outside the machine learning field in order to evangelize recent machine learning techniques and encourage adoption of Divvy.

Pollington	06/30/2016	$239,997.00		dejong@math.columbia.edu	2960 Broadway	NEW YORK	NY	100276902	2128546851	MPS	1264		$0.00	The research funded by the award will be directed towards several closely related questions and activities. A first part of the project is to build the theory of algebraic stacks from scratch, with the goal of writing foundations for algebraic stacks with a minimal amount of assumptions on the base scheme, no separation axioms for algebraic spaces, and no separation axioms for algebraic stacks. This will be continually documented online in the stacks project, see http://math.columbia.edu/algebraic_geometry/stacks-git. Many algebraic stacks are quotient stacks, but this is not always the case. A second component of the project involves the question of whether every algebraic stack is always etale locally a quotient stack. This is related to the question of whether the cohomological Brauer group and the classical Brauer group coincide for separated smooth algebraic spaces over a field. This leads into other questions, especially the relation between period and index for Brauer classes. A third part of the project is to see whether there exists a natural degree map on the group of zero cycles on a GIT-stack. And finally, the project includes a fourth part aimed at studying moduli of stacky curves, which is a natural explicit example of a higher algebraic stack. Throughout the PI will moderate the stacks project mentioned above.<br/><br/>A question that has long fascinated physicists and philosophers is:<br/>What is space? For a mathematician a 3-dimensional manifold seems a good first approximation to space. After learning about special relativity a four dimensional space with a Lorentz metric seems closer. After learning about the standard model it seems that space comes endowed with certain vector bundles. And so on. In algebraic geometry students are taught early on that there are many different spaces, and that in fact the collection of all spaces forms itself some kind of space. A famous example is the moduli space of curves of genus g (Riemann surfaces) which is used by physicists in string theory. In a fundamental paper on moduli of curves in algebraic geometry, Deligne and Mumford pointed out that the space of curves has additional structure in that its points come endowed with certain finite groups (namely the automorphism groups of the corresponding curves). They coined the phrase algebraic stack to denote this type of space. It turns out that the language of algebraic stacks is an extremely useful tool in studying very classical objects such as vector bundles on curves and surfaces, moduli of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, etc, etc. The project will partly develop the foundations of algebraic stacks in a very general setting, and partly find new properties of these spaces, such as whether the finite groups attached to the points of an algebraic stack all in some natural way are contained in a single bigger group.

McCartney	05/31/2014	$463,609.00		Robert.Guralnick@colorado.edu	3100 Marine Street, Room 481	Boulder	CO	803031058	3034926221	BIO	1165, 1679	1165, 9179, 9183, 9184, BIOT	$0.00	Yale University and the University of Colorado Boulder are awarded grants to develop an interactive, online species distribution workbench and knowledge-base, the Map of Life, as the fundamental mechanism for documentation, integration, and advance of human biodiversity distribution knowledge. Despite hundreds of years of active exploration, human knowledge of the distribution of biodiversity remains very limited. A fundamental factor in this shortcoming is that the majority of direct and indirect information about species' distributions has not been mobilized and integrated. While researchers can readily access fine-scale environmental data with global coverage, access to integrated species distribution information at validated precision remains elusive. This collaborative project will develop a conceptual and cyberinfrastructure framework for provisioning and improving reliable species geographic range information. Map of Life will combine on a single website expert range maps, survey data, and range maps adjusted for species habitat suitability initially for terrestrial vertebrate species, with extensions planned for other animal and plant groups. It will therefore serve the needs of all those requiring estimates of species geographic ranges across taxonomic groups and regions, such as scientists, land-managers, governments, policy-makers and the general public. Users can upload data, edit input or output and directly improve or comment on existing maps which will iteratively lead to more advanced species distribution knowledge. Users can also download any and all maps in different formats directly from the application or perform batch-download for multiple species. Finally, simple richness and regional species list tools will extend the products to users with a geographic focus. <br/><br/>Given that species range maps are one of the most commonly used and familiar information products in biology, the potential broader impacts and benefits of Map of Life to society are remarkable. Unlike printed range maps, the dynamic nature of editable online range maps encourages the public to move from roles of passive consumers to prosumers; they can both produce and consume information and generate new knowledge. The Map of Life project also presents a unique cross-disciplinary training opportunity in macroecology and biodiversity informatics. Dedicated lab exchanges between Yale and the University of Colorado, along with workshops and symposia at professional meetings will allow extensive cross-fertilization of ideas. The PIs will also develop targeted map and web tutorials illustrating the notion of human understanding of a species' geographic range and will showcase those products at the Yale Peabody Museum and the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History.

The iHUB is a collaborative workspace with components that integrate both cyberinfrastructure and human interactions to maximize both community access to ionomic resources, and knowledge extraction from these resources. Specifically, the iHUB project will deliver (1) tools to allow the easy sharing and annotation of data, (2) the LitCloud: A tool to allow the easy filtering and sharing of literature, (3) tools to allow the coordinated collection of ionomics data from distributed sites, (4) tools to allow the easy sharing of presentations and lectures, (5) tools to allow the self formation of online work groups and communication, (6) the iHUB interaction map (iHUB interactome), and (7) on-line help tools. The iHUB will be founded on the existing public ionomics database (www.ionomicshub.org) which currently contains ionomic data on over 200,000 samples, including Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To ensure integration of the iHUB with the community we also plan workshops and scientist exchanges.<br/><br/>These iHUB functionalities will help bridge the growing gap between the high-throughput generation of ionomic data and the efficient probing of gene function on a genomic and comparative genomic scale. The iHUB will facilitate open communication and exchange of information, and will lower the barrier for entry into the field of ionomics, allowing a diverse set of researchers from developed and developing nations to participate in advancing the field. The information obtained from the discoveries facilitated by the iHUB will be valuable from the point of view of improving crop yields, enhancing agricultural sustainability, and improving food quality for human nutrition.

Thousands of pages of technical publications spanning >100 years of museum scholarship have been based on this material, which includes many endangered and/or extinct species. Although some parts of the collection (notably the type specimens and fluid-preserved material) are in good housing, most of the skins (about 11,000 specimens) remain in substandard cabinetry, discolored by dust and urban soot and at risk from insect pests. Overcrowding has resulted in mechanical damage to some specimens, skins are stored on acidified paper trays with brittle glue joints, and the electronic specimen database has never been proofed for accuracy against drawer contents. This award provides funds to demolish old cabinetry, to renovate collection spaces, to purchase new specimen cases and other archival-quality curatorial materials, and to make other improvements necessary to preserve this important heritage collection for future generations of scientific researchers. The AMNH marsupial collection is widely used by scientists to study biodiversity in many parts of the world currently threatened by habitat destruction. For example, AMNH specimens document the former presence of many endangered or extinct opossums, bandicoots, and kangaroos in places where they no longer exist. These specimens are also sources of DNA for evolutionary studies, they are used to illustrate guide books that help conservationists and ecotourists identify animals that they see in the field, and they provide material for educational public exhibitions that are seen by millions of museum-goers every year. Funds from this grant will be used to further the preservation of this irreplaceable heritage collection for future generations.

Itsweire	06/30/2015	$446,113.00	James Potemra, Ryo Furue	jay@hawaii.edu	2440 Campus Road, Box 368	HONOLULU	HI	968222234	8089567800	GEO	1610	9150	$0.00	Objectives and intellectual Merit: A remarkable aspect of the upper-ocean circulation in the tropical and subtropical South Indian Ocean (SIO) is the presence of near-surface, eastward flow across the basin, which often appears as a set of distinct currents and jets. These currents have been detected in observations and simulated in numerical models. At the same time, their underlying dynamics remain unclear. In this regard, they flow counter to the westward direction predicted by both Ekman and Sverdrup theory. Furthermore, they appear to be linked to the Leeuwin Current (LC) along the west coast of Australia and to larger-scale circulations , namely, the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) and the Southern Ocean. Thus, the eastward flow represents a fundamental gap in our understanding of the large-scale mean flow in the SIO. <br/><br/>This project will use analyses of in situ observations and numerical models to fill that gap. The observational analysis will rely on three main datasets. Each dataset combines Argo data with historical data, the different mapping techniques resulting in products with characteristics suited to different aspects of the analysis: the CARS dataset developed at CSIRO is a high-quality monthly-mean dataset of T , S , and other water-mass properties, which allows for tracing watermasses; the IPRC dataset incorporates the additional product of absolute dynamic topography, allowing an estimation of absolute geostrophic velocity; and the UTas dataset maps Argo and historical data on density surfaces, which will be useful in resolving finer frontal features and characterizing downwelling/upwelling regions. Satellite winds will be used to compute Ekman and Sverdrup flows and to force the models. To test specific hypotheses about the processes that control the surface eastward currents, an ocean circulation model will be used.<br/><br/>The research team combines the talents of scientists at the IPRC, CSIRO, and the University of Tasmania, with scientists at the latter institutions contributing their extensive knowledge of in situ observations in the SIO to the project<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Understanding the dynamics of these first-order features is necessary to validate and improve climate models. Moreover, these currents interact with the LC and the ITF, and are likely part of a basin-scale overturning circulation closed by downwelling within the LC and near the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The dynamics of the surface eastward currents therefore should play an important role in SIO decadal variability. The results will likely apply to similar features in the other oceans.

They determine such varied outcomes as which student goes to which college, who gets what job, and who buys what house. Recent work on the theory of matching markets has been useful to the design of markets as well as for the repair of market failures. Much of this work, however, has focused on the design and analysis of centralized matching markets. Many matching markets are not fully centralized; for example, college admissions decisions in the United States are made by each individual institution on its own. Furthermore, almost all of the centralized matching marekts are preceeded by decentralized opportunities for participants to match. This award funds research on the game theory of these decentralized markets as well as lab experiments and a field study to identify the crucial elements that determine decentralized market outcomes.<br/><br/>The field study uses the newly developed theory to analyze a unique data set tracing the way a specific adoption agency matched adopting parents to domestic birth mothers. The goal is to use these data to better understand the preferences of adoptive parents and birth mothers towards potential matches. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The theory and experiments will provide useful tools for improving the design of matching markets. The field study gives crucial information for child advocates who are seeking to improve state-level policy towards adoption and foster care.

The resource material includes the ConcepTests for formative assessment, standardized assessment tools for summative assessment and the material for Just-In-Time Teaching (JITT) including Reactive Homework problems for modern physics and quantum mechanics courses. The research-based material will continue to be developed using findings of student misconceptions and difficulties in learning quantum mechanics. A major goal of this phase of the project will be a rigorous assessment of the material at other colleges and Universities. Control studies comparing similar courses in Modern Physics and Quantum Mechanics in which Peer Instruction was employed with those for which this pedagogical method was not employed are ongoing. Such studies will be extended to other colleges and universities. Standardized assessment tools involving multiple-choice questions will continue to be developed and refined for assessment purposes. Peer Instruction material developed will continue to be disseminated through workshops at professional meetings, publications in journals, personal and professional society websites, and presentations at colloquia and seminars at various universities and colleges. The resource material developed as part of this project will be published as a reference book suitable for instructors towards the end of the project period.
0956309	Affect and Global versus Local Information Processing	BCS	SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY	06/15/2010	06/14/2010	Linda Isbell	MA	University of Massachusetts Amherst	Standard Grant	Sally Dickerson	05/31/2014	$350,000.00		lisbell@psych.umass.edu	Research Administration Building	Hadley	MA	010359450	4135450698	SBE	1332	1332	$0.00	The goal of this research project is to examine the ways in which people's feelings (i.e., affect) influence their thoughts, judgments, and behavior. Many theories of affect and cognition suggest that specific feelings lead individuals to process information either globally (with a focus on the big picture) or locally (with a focus on details). A large body of research suggests that happiness is tied to global processing, whereas sadness is tied to local processing. The current research challenges the notion of a dedicated link between particular feeling states and global versus local processing. This project advances a theoretical framework that suggests that the impact of feelings on information processing is highly malleable and depends significantly on the context in which the feelings are experienced. The research tests this framework in three key social psychological domains that are of both theoretical and real-world importance: the self, impression formation, and perceptions of groups. <br/><br/>Four sets of two studies will examine the impact of feelings and global versus local processing inclinations when generating information about the self (Studies 1-2), when forming impressions of others under typical experimental conditions (Studies 3-4) and under more real-world decision-making conditions (Studies 5- 6), and when forming perceptions of groups members (Studies 7-8). Studies 5-8 are also designed to extend the proposed framework to more real-world judgment contexts (hiring, voting) where individuals actively seek out information about others to form a judgment and to situations in which individuals can engage in meaningful real-world behaviors (i.e., helping group members, voting). This research project will advance our theoretical understanding of the affect-cognition relationship while advancing knowledge in key social psychological domains. Knowledge gained from this research will shed light on how real-world judgments and behaviors are influenced by feelings. This project will also provide scientific training and educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, some of whom are members of underrepresented groups.

The FTIR laboratory, and particularly the mapping capability of the system, has made possible research projects on the relationship between flow banding and water concentration variations in rhyolitic lavas, volatiles in the K-T Deccan basalts of India, the role of water in deformation of quartz crystals in shear zones, and water concentrations in lunar and Martian glasses and crystals, among others. This grant will fund the purchase of a heating stage that will be used to homogenize bubble-bearing melt inclusions so that accurate measurements of volatile concentrations can be obtained. In addition, the grant will fund the purchase of a cooling stage that will be used to freeze samples so that the spectral characteristics of H-O species can be examined to determine whether water occurs as part of the mineral structure or whether it occurs in fluid inclusions in the crystal. Finally, a video camera for characterizing textural characteristics of specimens, and a rotatable stage to permit collection of spectra in orientations parallel to principal crystal vibration directions are funded. This instrumentation all contributes to the analytical goal of evaluating the origin and evolution of volatiles in igneous systems. <br/><br/>The broad significance of this project is the exploration of volcanic processes through Earth history and the role that volatile compounds play in explosive behavior and in climatic effects of volcanic eruptions. Minerals host samples of the molten material from which they crystallized. These captured samples of the parent melt are known as melt inclusions. Analyses of melt inclusions provide an evaluation of the climate-affecting gases that were dissolved in the parent melt and that were contributed to the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions. The equipment funded by this grant will be used to improve the ability of the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Massachusetts to accurately measure volatile concentrations in melt inclusions and to evaluate the behavior of volatile compounds in Earth reservoirs.
0962755	Collaborative Research: Causes and Consequences of Vocal Variation in a Howler Monkey (Alouatta spp.) Hybrid Zone: An Integrated Behavioral, Morphological and Genetic Approach	BCS	Biological Anthropology	07/01/2010	05/21/2014	Dawn Kitchen	OH	Ohio State University	Continuing grant	Rebecca Ferrell	06/30/2015	$63,389.00		kitchen.79@osu.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	Columbus	OH	432101016	6146888735	SBE	1392	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Hybrid zones typically encompass a variety of taxonomically and genetically distinct individuals living under similar ecological and social conditions. Thus, hybrid zones represent unique opportunities to separate intrinsic and extrinsic causes of variation among animals. Furthermore, because a variety of animals are in direct competition, hybrid zones are also ideal locations for studies of competitive ability. This project focuses on two species of howler monkeys, Alouatta palliata and A. pigra, with different vocalizationsthat hybridize in a small region in southern Mexico. The research builds on previous morphological and genetic sampling of the hybrid zone and addresses two main questions: 1) what causes vocal variation among A. palliata, A. pigra, and hybrids? and, 2) how do different vocalizations impact competitive ability in the hybrid zone? To address these questions the project integrates molecular, morphological, behavioral, and acoustic data with playback experiments. Sources of vocal differences will be uncovered by comparing vocalizations among purebred and hybrid males to their genetic background, morphology, location, and social setting. The playback experiments involve both males and females and reveals the types of calls that males find intimidating or females find attractive (or both). The study examines the proximate and ultimate factors shaping primate vocalizations, how sexual selection structures admixture and gene flow, and how differences in vocalizations affect sexual selection. <br/><br/>The project is highly collaborative and will strengthen research ties at many levels; between departments at the University of Michigan, between the University of Michigan and Ohio State University, and internationally between US universities and the Universidad Veracruzana in Mexico. In addition to providing considerable training to Mexican and US students, the project will directly benefit conservation through an educational workshop directed to school-age children within the area of hybridization. Furthermore, the presence of a long-term study in the region and the inclusion of Mexican researchers and students will promote primate studies and conservation in Mexico, a country of high biogeographic importance for primates and other Neotropical taxa.

Existing defenses typically either attempt to secure the hosts within the enterprise or add a security perimeter to the network. These conventional defenses are ineffective in the face of compromised hosts, mobile devices, and insider threats. Dynamic Information-Flow Tracking (DIFT) techniques maintain data provenance information about objects within the system and control information flow by defining and implementing policies that dictate how that information should be allowed to flow. Although powerful, existing DIFT approaches are limited by the fact of targeting only a single layer on a single physical host, which limits their effectiveness and practical applicability.<br/><br/>This research will develop MEDITA, a multi-layer DIFT mechanism that can precisely, securely, and efficiently track data flowing within a networked EIS and across layers, and control the flow of such data based on the data provenance and the security policy in place. Multi-layer DIFT holds great promise for controlling information flow within an enterprise in many real-world scenarios. Despite its appeal, however, realizing a system that could implement such DIFT policies in practice is extremely challenging because of the wide variety of attacks that can be mounted, ranging from copying and pasting the sensitive data to writing the document to removable storage or a mobile device. To address these and other challenges, this research will (1) refine existing techniques for performing DIFT within the individual layers of an EIS, (2) design and implement the integration and inter-operation of DIFT techniques between layers, (3) define a language that can be used to express multi-layer security policies for the EIS and mechanisms for translating those policies to tainting and enforcement mechanisms; and (4) Develop a prototype implementation of MEDITA and perform experiments by using the prototype to apply MEDITA to realistic information-flow tracking control scenarios.

Such models can be used to evaluate the impact of reforms to the social insurance and tax system and to make quantitative statements about the welfare effects of proposed and existing policies. Our estimation approach combines observational and experimental variation in incentives and opportunities. The experimental variation in welfare rules allows us to relax many of the key assumptions typically employed when estimating behavioral responses to changes in program rules. Our ability (or inability) to accurately predict the results of markedly different randomized experiments provides a policy-relevant metric for evaluating our modeling framework in general and, more specifically, our ability to account for self-selection into program and labor market participation.<br/><br/>The project will deliver two research papers. The first paper focuses on assessing the extent to which the ability of labor supply models to match experimental impacts depends upon measurement issues and modeling complexity. We will begin by developing and estimating a model of welfare participation and labor supply using data from the California Work Pays Demonstration Project (CWPDP) -- a large scale randomized welfare reform experiment implemented in California in the early 1990s. The longitudinally merged administrative and survey data available from this experiment allow us to measure the budgets (and hence incentives) of agents in substantially more detail than previous studies. Moreover, the various components of the data contain independent repeated measurements on a number of key variables allowing us to detect and model recording and reporting problems in a more satisfactory manner than has previously been attempted in this literature.<br/><br/>We will then examine how our estimates change when we coarsen the choices available to agents, use approximate rather than exact policy rules, or ignore measurement problems. Our focus will be on how these changes influence our ability to match experimental impacts on quantities of direct policy interest such as total welfare payments and program participation. The analysis will also provide a quantitative unbundling of the incentive effects associated with the CWPDP treatment, allowing us to ascertain, for example, the relative importance of changes in welfare eligibility rules vs. changes in earnings disregards.<br/><br/>The second paper is motivated by the concern that randomized experiments may have little external validity. The CWPDP experiment, for instance, was conducted on a sample of on-going welfare recipients residing in four California counties during a sustained boom in the state job market. To what extent can what we learn from the California experiment be generalized to other populations, time periods, and program mixes? The many state welfare experiments conducted during the 1990s provide us with the opportunity to answer this question. We will use our estimates from the CWPDP sample to generate predictions about the results of randomized experiments in two other states. This will entail developing methods to re-estimate distributions of unobservable preferences and skills from the control observations available in each state's sample. We will conclude with an assessment of the practical advantages (if any) of access to experimental variation in generating credible out of sample policy predictions.<br/><br/>The broader impact of our project will be to develop methods for enhancing what can be learned from social experiments through use of a behavioral model. We seek to illustrate how to build and estimate economic models capable of pooling together and interpreting the results of multiple experiments in the presence of unobserved individual-level heterogeneity. We believe such methods will become increasingly important as social and field experiments continue to proliferate in economics.

It is expected that the advanced research described in this proposal will lead to sustainable, safer, environmentally clean and more efficient unconventional oil resource recovery techniques. These attributes will be critical to the economy, environment, and security of the United States in the 21st century.<br/><br/>This research proposal brings together random field theory and finite element methods, also known as the Random Finite Element Method RFEM, which will be developed and applied to the unique geotechnical conditions encountered in the unconventional oil resource recovery industry. The industrial partners at Shell have developed advanced deterministic modeling technologies for exploration and production of unconventional oil resources such as heavy oils and oil shale. This proposal enables Shell to work with academic collaborators at the Colorado School of Mines to include advanced probabilistic based numerical simulation methods into their modeling capabilities. In addition, the practical applications and data made available by the industrial partners will greatly enhance the usefulness of software developed predominantly in an academic environment.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will improve industry-university research linkage in the design and implementation of unconventional oil resource recovery techniques. The aim is to set a high industry standard for unconventional oil resources extraction which will undoubtedly be under close public scrutiny due to the important environmental implications. It is also anticipated that this research will lead to an understanding and recognition of the importance of risk and reliability methodologies among the public, including engineers of the industrial partner.<br/><br/>Developments made in this research will also lead to improved understanding and implementation of risk and reliability methodologies into more routine geotechnical design.

Conceptual and numerical models of abrupt changes and the role of high vs. low latitudes as the drivers of climate change invoke sea ice as a principle cause of variability, but to date there have been no reliable proxies of past sea ice extent. Understanding the role of sea ice in past changes also critically impacts our understanding of the consequences of future changes in Arctic sea ice cover. This research calibrates and applies a set of new organic biomarkers (IP25 sea ice index, and TEX86 temperature index) to reconstruct changes in sea ice and associated sea surface temperatures from a series of high sedimentation rate cores from the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Specifically, the researchers will 1) produce a high latitude spatial dataset of relative IP25 concentrations and compare the distribution of these compounds with modern sea ice extent, 2) generate a new database of biomarker distributions in surface sediments from high-latitude oceans and compare with known SST variations, and 3) reconstruct past changes in seasonal sea ice and associated sea surface temperatures during the late glacial and Holocene from selected high latitude sites. In addition to the societal relevance of better understanding the role of sea ice extent in climate change, broader impacts include support of a PhD student, summer research projects for undergraduates, and a new faculty member at the University of Texas at Austin.
0950601	How much input is required for infant language learning: Exploring the distribution of types and tokens	BCS	LINGUISTICS, DS - Developmental Sciences	06/15/2010	06/12/2010	LouAnn Gerken	AZ	University of Arizona	Standard Grant	Laura Namy	05/31/2015	$394,149.00		gerken@email.arizona.edu	888 N Euclid Ave	Tucson	AZ	857194824	5206266000	SBE	1311, 1698		$0.00	Infants and children are remarkably adept at learning language, much more adept in fact than their parents. Until recently, two theories competed to explain the language learning skill of young children. In one view, infants and children are like sponges, soaking up every detail of their environment, including the linguistic environment. In a competing view, infants come into the world with the range of human languages (or grammars) already built-in. Their linguistic environment serves only to allow them to select the particular grammar of their native language, such as what speech sounds will be used, whether verbs come in the middle or the end of sentences, etc. Recently, a third view has begun gaining support. This view shares the position of the first view that infants and children are highly sensitive to every detail of their environment. It shares the position of the second view that infants and children have as their goal determining the particular linguistic system or grammar of their community. One way to discriminate among these three theories is the amount and kind of input required for optimal language learning. The first sponge view (or Associative theories) suggests that a great deal of input is needed and that it does not matter much whether that input consists of many repetitions (tokens) of the same example (type; e.g., hearing the word dogs as the plural of dog multiple times) or different examples (e.g., hearing dogs, pigs, and mugs as the plurals of their respective singulars). The second built-in grammars view (or Innate Domain theories) suggests that extremely little input is needed and that even a single repetition of a single example is sufficient for the infant or child to learn a particular component of the native language. The third grammar-seeking sponge view (or Hypothesis Selection theories) suggests that a very small number (e.g., three) of different examples are needed for learning and that different examples are much more helpful than repetitions of an example. This project will compare these three theories by asking about the amount of input needed for language learning. It also attempts to embed the third theory in a more realistic model of human learners by asking if learning always improves as the number of examples increases, or whether there is a trade-off between the number of examples and the number of repetitions of each example.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to our scientific knowledge by asking whether humans are reflections of their environment, their biology, or whether and how the mind is a product of a biological brain with a primary goal of making sense of the environment. Moreover, because the research draws on existing studies of infant vision and infant social interaction, it places the study of language development in a broader developmental context. Finally, the research explores the specific kinds of input that maximize learning. Therefore, it has the potential to ultimately inform how we present linguistic and other information to infants, school children, and even adults in order to result in the best possible learning in the shortest possible time.
0968456	Collaborative Research: CSEDI--Grand Challenge for Experimental Study of Plastic Deformation Under Deep Earth Conditions	EAR	GEOPHYSICS, INSTRUMENTATION & FACILITIES	07/01/2010	04/03/2012	Yanbin Wang	IL	University of Chicago	Continuing grant	Robin Reichlin	06/30/2014	$499,731.00		wang@cars.uchicago.edu	5801 South Ellis Avenue	Chicago	IL	606375418	7737028669	GEO	1574, 1580	0000, 1031	$0.00	The main goal of this joint project is to further develop the experimental techniques of studying plastic deformation under deep Earth conditions. When a large force (stress) is applied to minerals or rocks under shallow Earth conditions, they will be deformed by brittle fracture. In the deep interior of Earth, temperature is higher and then plastic deformation becomes possible. This plastic deformation helps material circulation by convection that cools Earth and causes most of geological activities including mountain building and deep circulation of water and other materials. However, to date very little is known on the plastic flow properties of materials under deep Earth conditions due mainly to the technical difficulties. For example, in the deep interior of Earth, not only is temperature high, but also pressure is high. Usually pressure suppresses atomic motion and hence plastic deformation becomes difficult under high-pressure conditions. Does the role of pressure become more important than temperature and hence the viscosity of materials increases with depth? Also most of minerals undergo a series of phase transformations. How do these phase transformations affect the plastic properties? These issues are critical to our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of Earth and other terrestrial planets. <br/><br/>Despite its importance, almost nothing was known about these deep earth deformation as recently as ~ten years ago. Recognizing this need, the investigators started a group effort to develop new techniques of plastic deformation under deep Earth conditions in 2002. Based on the studies during the previous funding periods, they have made major progress including the development of new types of deformation apparatus and the improvements to the stress (and strain) measurements using synchrotron x-ray sources. As a result, we can now conduct quantitative deformation experiments to ~20 GPa and ~2000 K. However, these conditions correspond only to the depth of ~500 km. Earth's mantle extends to ~2900 km. Also, there has been very poor control of water content in materials previously studied. In this new phase of technical development, the team of investigators will focus on (i) extending the maximum pressure to ~30 GPa and higher (~1000 km depth), (ii) improving the control of chemical environment (such as water fugacity) under high-pressure conditions, and (iii) improving the stress measurements through the use of new hardware and theory. These developments will allow investigation of the plastic properties of Earth materials to the conditions equivalent to the shallow part of the lower mantle under well-controlled chemical environment. Applications of these techniques will shed important new light into our understanding of dynamics of whole Earth. The project is a collaboration among teams at four institutions, and will provide enhanced infrastructure to the experimental geophysics community, including new facilities at national synchrotron beamlines that will be available to the broader community. The developments will include training and mentoring of graduate students and post doctoral scholars.

The studies build on earlier work by Linic at the University of Michigan to produce ethylene oxide. Heterogeneous Ag catalysts are almost exclusively used for this reaction commercially. EO is a critical chemical used in the synthesis of ethylene glycol (antifreeze), ethanolamines, and detergents. Computations by Linic suggested that particular faces of Ag would offer higher selectivity to desired products. Novel synthetic strategies were then developed for the synthesis of the shape-specific Ag nano-structures. <br/><br/>With the demonstration that well-defined Ag nano-structures can be highly selective catalysts for partial oxidation of ethylene, the challenge of propylene partial oxidation to propylene oxide is a logical extension. There are no selective heterogeneous catalysts for this important, large scale chemical process. The PI has shown that there exists a critical link between the shape of catalytic metallic Ag particles and their performance, and that the main factor affecting the performance is the shape-specific surface termination of the particles. The PI hypothesizes that Ag nano-cube and nano-wire catalysts, terminated specifically by the Ag(100) facet, will be significantly more selective in direct epoxidation of propylene than conventional spherical Ag particles, which are terminated by the (111) facet. The PI hypothesizes that specific metallic Ag nanostructures, enhanced with chiral modifiers, will be promising heterogeneous catalysts for asymmetric epoxidation of larger olefins (for example styrene) to form chiral epoxides. Currently, complex and expensive homogeneous catalysts are used for chiral oxidation reactions as they offer greater regio- and stereo-selectivity than conventional heterogeneous solid state catalysts. <br/><br/>The proposed research project attempts to constructively integrate the fields of nanoscience and heterogeneous catalysis by taking advantage of recent advances in the controlled synthesis of metallic nano-particles of different shapes and different surface terminations to design highly selective inorganic catalysts. The transformative nature to the successful outcome of this study is quite apparent. A new heterogeneously-catalyzed route to propylene oxide has large scale commercial implications. Furthermore, developing viable heterogeneous catalysts for chiral olefin epoxidation reactions would offer significant advantages with respect to their homogeneous counterparts including easy product separation, longer catalyst lifetime, easier catalyst regeneration, and possible utilization of cheaper and environmentally friendlier oxidizing agents such as oxygen.

The flow of water masses between the Bering Sea and the Arctic and Pacific oceans, changes in Arctic ice volume, and whether dense intermediate waters formed in the Pacific during this time will be investigated as some of the possible triggers of past climate change. The high resolution sediment records obtained from this cruise, with relatively large-amplitude signals, provide a unique opportunity to understand how insulation changes in the upper atmosphere propagate through the climate system and to further test if the orbital cycles of climate change primarily operate on 23ky versus 40 ky timescales. This study utilizes K % logging data from the cruise with paleomagnetic, sedimentological (eg., grain size analysis) and paleontological (eg., analysis of microfossil assemblages; d18O and d13C measurements of benthic and planktonic forams) measurements from the drill cores. The information expected from this study is critical for understanding the fundamental drivers and feedbacks between ice sheets, oceanic and atmospheric circulation and the global carbon cycle. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project significantly advances large investments previously made in an important IODP expedition. The data derived from this investigation can provide important information for paleoclimate/ocean models, and is relevant towards projections of future climate under IPCC AR4 scenarios. The project includes a team of early and mid-career scientists, and includes international collaborations with other scientists of the IODP community. Support is also provided for undergraduate and graduate education, and for public outreach and education.

The concerted application of comprehensive, two-dimensional gas chromatography, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, and pyrosequencing-based metagenomics will provide unparalleled insight into petroleum biodegradation and the responsible microbes, and distinguishes this work from any previous studies. The primary hypotheses to be tested are the following: 1) Hydrocarbon biodegradation by microbes acts simultaneously on thousands of distinct compounds, not in a strictly stepwise fashion. 2) Hydrocarbon preference pattern and associated genomic potential for a<br/>microbial community are controlled primarily by the redox potential of the terminal electron-accepting process. 3) High-molecular-weight and polar compounds are bio-transformed through incomplete oxidation and structural alteration, not through complete remineralization. These hypotheses will be tested by conducting time-series laboratory experiments in which petroleum is biodegraded with different electron acceptors and at different temperatures. The loss and gain patterns for molecules within each treatment and differences across treatments in these patterns and in genomic content will provide the data to test these hypotheses. Results are further anticipated to reveal novel metabolic actions and genomic capacity, and yield molecular degradation patterns that can relate environmental genomic and petroleum content to the relevant biological processes. New data analysis tools will also be developed and validated.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Results from this research will contribute broadly to an understanding of petroleum biodegradation and carbon cycling in the Earth system, and will be broadly disseminated through popular outlets with assistance from a professional artist. Knowledge gained from this research will also be translated directly to federal agencies including the NOAA?s Assessment and Restoration Division, as well as to private industry through existing corporate ties. Direct educational impacts of this research include the training and education of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as the advanced training of postdoctoral researchers. High school students will be incorporated through existing summer research programs targeting students from underserved regions. Undergraduate students will be incorporated into all aspects of the proposed research through integration into coursework and REU support. Mentoring of a graduate student and postdoctoral researchers will be provided by the PIs.

GWB detection is pursued with minimal assumptions on the source and the signal morphology: this offers the intriguing possibility of serendipitous discoveries, but also the challenges of interpreting an unmodeled result and extracting its science. The PI will build on past experience to establish a robust program in GWB science, with two components, both timely for LIGO. 1) GWB Science in Enhanced LIGO. The PI's group will have a lead role in the prompt analysis of Enhanced LIGO data (collected during 2009-2010) and in the achievement of high confidence in a potential GWB detection, understanding and suppressing the rate of noise transients that constitute the ultimate sensitivity limit for LIGO. This effort will provide input from the analysis to detector experts and devise software remedies when noise sources cannot be found or fixed. 2) Preparing for Advanced LIGO and gravitational wave astronomy with GWBs. In the longer term, the group will implement techniques of parameter estimation and interpretation of GWB detections, in collaboration with numerical relativity and source modeling experts, to maximize the science output from the start of Advanced LIGO (in approximately 2014). In addition, the group will participate in multi-messenger observations with electromagnetic and neutrino counterparts. <br/><br/>Gravitational waves are a new science frontier. These tiny ripples in the fabric of spacetime, predicted by the Theory of General Relativity, carry information from the most catastrophic and mysterious events in our universe: the birth and death of a star, the collision of black holes and the Big Bang. As LIGO makes steady progress towards its Advanced configuration, and in the anticipation of detection, gravitational wave scientists, numerical relativists and astrophysicists are joining forces and preparing for a new era of gravitational wave astronomy: a multi-disciplinary approach is crucial for the success of the gravitational wave program. Graduate student training is integrant part of this proposal, on three fronts. In the next five years the PI will: (1) supervise graduate students, active in LIGO core science, in her group and as task leader in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC); (2) establish a mentoring program to support scientific and professional development of graduate students across the LSC, with the support of the LIGO Academic Advisory Council, of which she is member; (3) design a new course on introductory data analysis techniques for UMass graduate students and advanced undergraduates in astrophysics and particle physics. For a broader outreach, this outreach will also support the deployment of a program on supernovae, black holes and gravitational waves, with lectures and hands-on activities. This will add an astrophysics component to UMass STEM activities like the after-school STEM-RAY and the Saturday Seminar series for teachers. The program will be brought to K-12 classrooms and girl scout troops in Western Massachusetts, to encourage the interest of girls in science. Students and postdocs will be engaged in the preparation and delivery of this outreach, for a mutual learning experience.

Testing a global hypothesis using the Australian fossil mammal record - Christine Janis, Brown University and John Damuth, University of California, Santa Barbara<br/><br/>Is there evidence for a previously unrecognized worldwide change in terrestrial ecosystems approximately 12 million years ago? The PIs hypothesize that a striking pattern that they observed first in the history of the mammal faunas of North America may be one that is actually observable throughout the globe. This project will test this hypothesis by determining whether the same pattern occurred contemporaneously in the fossil record of Australia. Previous research showed that before 12-10 million years ago in North America, many ecological communities contained exceptionally high numbers of species of browsing ungulates (large leaf-eating herbivores)up to three times the numbers seen in vegetationally comparable modern-day habitats. In fact, the numbers of browser species in some places exceeded even those for modern tropical rainforests the present-day habitats with the highest biodiversity of browsers. No other members of these mammal faunas showed any elevated or unusual biodiversity, and faunas younger than 12-10 million years show only normal numbers of browser species (by today's standards). Why the older habitats were sometimes able to support what today would be impossibly high numbers of browsers is currently unknown. However, evidence suggests that some European and African faunas from before 12 million years ago also showed too many browsers, which in turn suggests a global cause. This project will answer the question of whether there were also too many browsers in the well-documented mammalian fossil record of Australia, and, if so, whether this phenomenon disappeared at about the same time as it did in North America. Study of museum collections from Australian localities will allow determination of the numbers of browser species at different times, based on morphology and wear of the teeth. Australia's distinct fauna and environmental history will provide a robust test of whether too many browsers was a global occurrence. If it wasn't, then we must look for regional or local causes; but if the global hypothesis is supported then a worldwide phenomenon becomes more likely and these results will guide and motivate the subsequent search for a global cause. The project's results will have implications not only for global environmental history and climate change, but also for any methods that attempt paleoecological interpretations for faunas older than 10 million years that use modern mammal faunas as an environmental proxy. This project will be a new international collaboration and will involve students and postdoctoral researchers.

By contrast, complex systems in nature such as ant colony and human brain are driven by the collective dynamics involving a large number of simple units interacting with each other as well as the environment. How those units form a globally complex behavior in a self-organizing fashion remains a big mystery in science. Solving this puzzle, even partially, may have profound implications into the design and optimization of integrative and hybrid systems that could better serve various engineering applications. This project focuses on a collective approach toward the integration of sensing and processing. Unlike compressed sensing whose success is based on ingenious construction of mathematical norms or basis functions, this project exploits the underlying organizational principle of sensory signals in the physical world. Upon the successful completion of this project, there will be an improved understanding of how the collective dynamics of complex networks interacts with the sensing component to support complex tasks such as motion perception and pattern recognition.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed research activities will be integrated into the education through training graduate students (including ethnics of scientific research), promoting network-science related learning, developing cyber-space teaching material, and broadening the participation of underrepresented groups. All collected data, produced codes and experimental results will be released to the public, which promotes the principle of reproducible research. The scientific perspective toward engineering is expected to benefit engineering students both inside and outside the classroom. The connection between network science and sensor technology could leverage into the industry of electronic imaging and have potential impact on the design of integrated sensor systems.

0943710	Quantifying Lateral Flow of Water in Alpine Snowpacks Using High Resolution Geophysical Techniques	EAR	HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES	07/01/2010	06/22/2012	Hans-Peter Marshall	ID	Boise State University	Continuing grant	Thomas Torgersen	06/30/2014	$228,963.00	James McNamara, John Bradford	hpmarshall@boisestate.edu	1910 University Drive	Boise	ID	837250001	2084261574	GEO	1579	1579	$0.00	Quantifying lateral flow of water in alpine snowpacks<br/>using high resolution geophysical techniques<br/><br/>PROJECT ABSTRACT<br/>In addition to inherent variability in falling snow, both wind redistribution and variations in radiation balance cause large spatial variability in the timing and location of input of snowmelt to the ground. However, even when these major drivers are accounted for, physically based hydrologic modeling is challenging, suggesting that there may be other processes controlling when and where snowmelt enters the subsurface. Most snowmelt models treat the snowpack as homogeneous, and assume that all meltwater moves vertically to the ground. Numerous experiments have shown that snowmelt follows a complicated path through the snowpack, moving both laterally along stratigraphic boundaries and vertically in concentrated cylindrical channels. While theoretical approaches have been developed to account for heterogeneities such as stratigraphy and vertical preferential flow paths, they are not applied in practice due to a lack of quantitative field-based measurements.<br/>We suggest that lateral movement of liquid water during melt and rain-on-snow events can be an important mechanism of water redistribution in steep, snow-dominated catchments. Flow of water within snowpacks is a complicated and poorly understood phenomenon. Permeability boundaries cause slope-parallel lateral flow over large distances, and coupled with cylindrical, vertical melt pathways, there is a resulting large spatial variability at the slope scale. An improved understanding of the lateral flow of water in snow will have impacts for a broad range of problems including: 1) rain-on-snow events which have the potential to cause flooding and landslides. The snowpack provides a large mass of water to melt, and may provide a faster route for the rainwater to enter streams. 2) A quantitative understanding of the timing and location of snowmelt within the seasonal snowpack is necessary in order to evaluate the importance of lateral flow on the seasonal hydrograph in snowmelt-dominated basins, and 3) quantifying lateral flow in snow is important for estimating the travel-time of meltwater traveling from polar ice caps and glaciers to the ocean which in turn is a basis for predicting time scales of sea level rise. Understanding the importance of lateral flow during rain-on-snow is important for forecasting floods, wet snow avalanches, and landslides, as mid-winter rain may become more common in a warming climate.<br/>This project will leverage state-of-the-art geophysical tools that already exist in-house at our institution to quantify lateral flow of water in alpine snowpacks. These include 1) measurements sensitive to microstructure which controls hydraulic conductivity, 2) rapid, non-destructive methods for measuring snow stratigraphy, depth, snow water equivalent, and liquid water content of both snow and the underlying soil, and 3) direct in-situ measurements of liquid water content. These measurements, combined with tracer experiments, will be used to characterize the snowpack conditions at the microscale that lead to lateral flow. The detailed snow and soil characterization will be used to estimate hydrologic properties for initial model conditions. Field data will be used to develop hydrologic models (using HYDRUS2D) of the experimental hillslopes to evaluate the relative importance of lateral flow in snow and soil in snowmelt-dominated catchments.

Maney<br/>Hofstra University<br/><br/>This project compares two cases of ethno-nationalist contention (patterns of action and reaction between authorities, challengers, and their opponents): the early stages of the Troubles in Northern Ireland and the first Palestinian Intifada. The investigators identify: (1) distinct effects upon contention of different types of media outlets; (2) types of coverage that promote escalation or de-escalation of political violence; (3) contextual factors influencing coverage, and (4) ways that interpretive disputes may contribute to conflict. The investigators link qualitative data on event coverage by multiple media sources with quantitative data on levels, forms, agents, and targets of contention. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: This study advances the fields of peace and conflict, social movements, and political communication. Theoretically, it develops a framework that specifies the relationship between media coverage and contention. Methodologically, it assesses hypotheses in an innovative way that is nuanced (investigating possible contrasting roles played by different types of media outlets), comparative (examining coverage across two political contexts), longitudinal (accounting for different stages of contention), and interactive (inclusive of multiple actors). By analyzing the distinct effects of different types of media coverage across political contexts, the results will assist policy makers, journalists, and activists in recognizing when and how their framing of political events impacts the dynamics of contention.

0961853	Collaborative Research: the influence of predators on community structure and resultant ecosystem functioning at a biogeographic scale	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	06/15/2010	07/10/2012	James Byers	GA	University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc	Standard Grant	David L. Garrison	05/31/2014	$261,861.00		jebyers@uga.edu	310 East Campus Rd	ATHENS	GA	306021589	7065425939	GEO	1650	9169, 9251, EGCH	$0.00	Predators structure ecological communities by consuming and altering the traits of prey, yet these effects have only recently been linked to local variation in ecosystem functions such as primary production and nutrient cycling. Such linkages may operate differently across biogeographic scales because factors known to affect local predator mechanisms also vary with latitude. The mismatch between knowledge of how predators locally affect ecosystem functions and the biogeographic range at which predator-prey interactions occur inhibits understanding of linkages between ecological communities and ecosystems, and thus our ability to manage valuable ecosystem services. Intertidal oyster reefs provide a model system to address this knowledge gap: they occur throughout the mid-Atlantic and Gulf coasts; they contain a similar food-web assemblage across latitudinal gradients in predation, resource supplies, and environmental conditions; they are strongly influenced by predator effects; and they influence sediment and nutrient cycles by enhancing benthic-pelagic coupling. This research involves a series of standardized sampling and experimental studies to: (1) investigate biogeographic patterns in oyster food web structure, resource supplies, environmental conditions, and sediment properties associated with reef function (2) determine how the vital rates of oysters, which can influence benthic-pelagic coupling, vary geographically; and (3) examine experimentally the relative importance of consumptive and non-consumptive predator effects on oyster reef communities and the ecosystem processes they provide and how these effects vary latitudinally. It will provide a mechanistic understanding of the basis for biogeographical shifts in valuable ecosystem services performed by an important marine foundation species, and it will also advance understanding of the interactions between predator effects in food webs and the ecosystem processes that depend on them.<br/><br/>By linking predator effects and benthic-pelagic coupling on oyster reefs in a biogeographic context, this research will provide valuable information to resource managers charged with restoring oyster reefs and recovering ecosystem services. By promoting the exchange of conceptual and methodological ideas among research groups at four major research universities, this project has already and will continue to foster interdisciplinary expertise among its investigators as well as their future graduate and undergraduate students. In addition to mentoring a post-doc, this research will prepare at least three graduate and three undergraduate students for scientific careers by having them independently develop projects related to the project. The investigators are committed to mentoring a diverse group of students across multiple educational levels, and they will continue to disseminate results to the public through lectures, open house events at their respective institutions, as well as radio, newspaper, and television interviews.
0961421	Collaborative Research: The impact of multiple nursery areas and adult age structure on the population dynamics of marine fishes	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	06/15/2010	09/16/2011	Cynthia Jones	VA	Old Dominion University Research Foundation	Continuing grant	David L. Garrison	05/31/2014	$570,000.00	Jason Schaffler	cjones@odu.edu	4111 Monarch Way	Norfolk	VA	235082561	7576834293	GEO	1650	4444, 9169, EGCH	$0.00	Many marine populations exhibit complex life histories in which larval and juvenile stages are spatially separated from adults. This is the case for many coastal-spawning, estuarine-dependent fishes which utilize multiple estuaries as nursery grounds to ensure that recruitment failure in any single estuary does not translate to total recruitment failure at the population level. For these species, the location and timing of spawning is believed to regulate the pattern of supply of larvae to potential estuarine nursery areas. Furthermore, many of these species exhibit age-dependent coastal migrations which increase in amplitude with age. Thus, there is the potential that changes in the age structure in the population can affect the pattern of supply of larvae to nursery areas and structure the pattern of recruitment. The investigators will carry out an integrated empirical and simulation approach to study the sources, patterns and consequences of larval supply to estuarine nursery areas for Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) along the East Coast of the US. The first goal will be to quantify the contribution of these nursery areas to coast wide recruitment. Juvenile menhaden from nursery areas from Massachusetts to Georgia will be sampled and the microchemical constituents of their otoliths will be characterized. These chemical signatures will be used to assign the nursery affinities of adult menhaden in the coastwide population. The investigators will test the null hypothesis that the Chesapeake Bay remains the most important source of recruits to the population. By determining the nursery affinities of adults from different year classes in the population they will assess whether the contribution of nurseries varies or has shifted over time. The second goal is use a population model linked to an individual-based coupled physical-biological model of recruitment to evaluate whether the known age-dependent migrations of adult menhaden are sufficient to cause the observed shifts in the distribution of larval menhaden that seed potential nursery areas. The simulation model will assist in evaluating mechanisms behind observed changes in the distribution of juvenile menhaden.<br/><br/>This work will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the regulation of spatially-structured marine populations. The last decade has seen the range extension of several estuarine-dependent marine species with dispersive larvae and the long-term recruitment decline of others. This integrated research program seeks to explore the effects of population demography, oceanographic circulation, and nursery site diversity on subsequent population dynamics. Given the documented changes in habitat quality in many estuarine nursery areas, and the anticipated impacts of climate change on oceanographic circulation, distributional changes in individual species are likely to become more common. Moreover, given the pivotal role that many estuarine-dependent species play in many marine ecosystems, understanding distributional changes will have direct consequences for the structure and function of the ecosystems to which they belong. The project will also train young scientists in areas of research (quantitative fisheries ecology, physical oceanography) for which there is current a national need.
0962124	The Economics of Social Conflict	SES	ECONOMICS	06/01/2010	09/11/2011	Debraj Ray	NY	New York University	Continuing grant	Nancy A. Lutz	05/31/2014	$272,714.00		debraj.ray@nyu.edu	70 WASHINGTON SQUARE S	NEW YORK	NY	100121019	2129982121	SBE	1320	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project examines the connections between economic development, the distribution of income and assets, and the emergence (or persistence) of social conflict across ethnic, geographical or economic groups. The research is informed by two basic stylized facts that characterize internal conflict in developing societies. First, economics matters. Conflicts have strong associations with economic variables such as per-capita income and natural resource revenues. Second, classical class conflicts --- or conflict demarcated along economic lines --- are rare: warring groups are often delineated by noneconomic markers such as ethnicity, caste, geography or religion.<br/><br/>This project takes these facts as points of departure. A central question concerns the coexistence of economic motives and noneconomic group markers. Noneconomic markers can be used to exclude certain groups from economic progress. Indeed, the more (economically) similar the warring groups, the more such a strategy is likely to be used. Accordingly, the first part of this project constructs a theory of group formation in conflict, the idea being that existing social markers (such as religion) can be used to create insiders and outsiders in a variety of ways. In a world in which all sorts of sidepayments can costlessly be made, each potential conflict can, in principle, because all conflict destroys resources. However, with a multiplicity of ethnic markers, any one of which may be invoked, it may be impossible to deal with every potential threat at the same historical moment of time. It will be argued that postwar institutions, such as progressive taxation or land reform, have evolved well to deal with the specter of class conflict, but have left the door open for threats from other noneconomic markers.<br/><br/>The second part of the project applies these ideas to an empirical study of Hindu-Muslim violence in India. If one side is socially and politically more able to use violence for economic ends, then an increase in the victim group's income should have a positive impact on conflict, while an increase in the aggressor group's income should have an insignificant effect. This sort of prediction can be tested, and the project proposes to do so. Using National Sample survey data along with a unique dataset on Hindu-Muslim conflict, preliminary results indicate that Muslim incomes are positively associated with future conflict, while Hindu incomes have no such effect. The project will build on this foundation by using additional data sources and running several different robustness checks.<br/><br/>The third part of the project develops a theoretical model, and establishes a structural connection between conflict and well-known indices of social distribution such as inequality, fractionalization and polarization. It is shown that three particular indices determine conflict, and the relative weights on them reveal the underlying values of structural parameters in the economy.<br/><br/>The PI also plans a full-length book manuscript on the Economics of Social Conflict. Certainly, the results from this project will form an important part of the book, but the intention is to put together, in a cohesive way, a large literature from economics, political science and sociology on the topic of conflict in developing countries.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: this project uses economic theory to develop testable predictions that reach beyond economic boundaries. For instance, the predicted juxtaposition of noneconomic group markers with the possibility of economic gains from conflict is a central theme. Likewise, the second part of this project, which discerns aggressor identity from economic data, exemplifies the attempt to go beyond economic boundaries. IPolitical scientists, sociologists and ethnographers will find this useful and complementary to their own work. The theory in part 3 generates a estimable relationship between conflict and various distributional indicators which will inform future empirical research in the area.<br/><br/>Finally, from a broader social and economic perspective, the questions asked under this project are of first-order importance. Does economic growth stifle conflict, or might it exacerbate it? What is the relationship between inequality and conflict? Why might class conflict give way to ethnic conflict? Does ethnic conflict stem from some primordial hatred and mistrust, or is it carefully engineered? If so, how precisely might one write down a theory of conflict that does not presume that participants are plain irrational? While the project is firmly grounded in the logic of economic reasoning, these questions go beyond economics.
0968596	US-Slovenia Workshop: Formalization of Modeling Languages	OISE	Catalyzing New Intl Collab	06/01/2010	07/11/2012	Barrett Bryant	AL	University of Alabama at Birmingham	Standard Grant	Bonnie Thompson	11/30/2012	$24,750.00	Jeffrey Gray, Marjan Mernik	Barrett.Bryant@unt.edu	AB 1170	Birmingham	AL	352940001	2059345266	O/D	7299	5979, 5999	$0.00	OISE 0968596<br/><br/>Bryant<br/><br/>This computer science workshop will be held in Slovenia to examine formalization of modeling languages which are central to reliable software tools and based on sound, fundamental programming principles. Participating senior and junior U.S. researchers will meet counterparts from two leading Slovenian universities to discuss five major challenges associated with formalization and the construction of automated software tools from such formalizations. The goal of U.S. organizer, Barrett Bryant from the University of Alabama-Birmingham, and his counterparts, Marjan Hericko of the University of Maribor and Viljan Mahnic of the University of Ljubljana, is to foster long-term collaboration between members of the U.S. and European research communities who are identified with computing and communication foundations and information systems. The intent is to identify promising approaches to: 1) inventing more easily used behavioral semantics formalisms; 2) extending models and metamodels with semantics; 3) generating different modeling tools constructed with tool specific information and generative algorithms like debuggers or simulators; 4) mapping to formalisms in ways that are transparent to end-users of modeling language; and 5) inventing tools or model checkers that are otherwise not possible without formal semantics.<br/><br/>Workshop results should help define an agenda for future study of fundamental concepts and techniques for more efficient automatic modeling approaches, programming language semantics, grammar-ware, and graph grammars. If successful, this could lead to wider consensus on the need for formalization in modeling language specification while strengthening cooperation between U.S. and European researchers who are language experts and software tools experts. This U.S.-Slovenian cooperative activity, organized in conjunction with the European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, fulfills the overall objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. Broader impacts include new insights arising from the timely interaction as well as the early career introduction of participating U.S. graduate students to researchers who lead current efforts to understand the relationships between models, metamodels and grammars that are considered key to increasing productivity and reliability in software engineering.

Research funded by this award will lead to the construction of compact discharge units (CDUs) that can be used to mitigate the charge on the test masses. Each unit features a steerable, low-energy electron beam to neutralize positive charges and a wide angle UV beam to photo-eject negative charges. The CDUs will be optimized for size, reliability, and discharge current within the UV-radiation level tolerable for the optical coating of the Advanced LIGO test masses. Testing of the units will be performed with an existing torsion balance that can measure the absolute charge on an insulator with conducting surface.<br/><br/>In fact, charge mitigation is important for a variety of precision mechanical experiments, including Advanced LIGO, torsion balances, and inertial masses in satellites. In all these systems, a sensitive test mass is electrically isolated from its surroundings. Charge accumulation can lead to spurious coupling between a test mass and nearby surfaces. This unwanted coupling leads to excess noise, degrading the performance of the experiments. The compact discharge unit can be used to reduce this extraneous noise by neutralizing charge on the test mass. Graduate students will participate in this project.

It will be theoretical, although in many aspects closely related to experiments. In LIGO instrumentation, this project seeks to finalize the optical-configuration design of LIGO detectors after the successful initial operation of Advanced LIGO; it will also critically evaluate optical configurations for third-generation detectors, the next major upgrade to LIGO, while continue to generate new ideas. This project will continue to study how gravitational-wave experiments will probe quantum mechanical behavior of macroscopic objects. In gravitational-wave data analysis, this project seeks strategies that enable fast detection of compact binary systems (consisting black holes and/or neutron stars) by incorporating advanced signal-processing techniques. In general relativity theory, this project seeks to shed light on the dynamics of the highly curved space-time of binary black-hole mergers. <br/><br/>This project will increase the scientific output of gravitational-wave astronomy by contributing to the short- and long-term improvement of instruments, by optimizing data analysis strategies, and by improving understandings of gravitational-wave sources. It will eventually lead to the experimental proof (or disproof) that quantum mechanical laws also apply to macroscopic (human-sized) objects. This project will also have the following broader impacts: (i) It will serve as a training ground for young theoretical physicists, through solving a broad range of problems. (ii) The PI will assume teaching responsibility at Caltech. He plans to update the web-based course in gravitational-wave science that he assisted Professor Kip Thorne in creating. This course has helped train graduate students at Caltech and other universities and institutes, and has made gravitational-wave science accessible to scientists and engineers throughout the world. (iii) Through cooperation with Glendale Community College, results of cutting-edge research in gravitational-wave science will be communicated to a diverse student body; participation of research projects by students with stronger math and physics background will encourage them to pursue a career in science and engineering. Through web pages and demonstration programs, gravitational-wave science will be communicated to a broader audience in the general public. (iv) The PI will carry out research in collaboration with scientists in Germany, Australia, Japan, and Russia. These collaborations will strongly influence the design of the European third-generation gravitational-wave detector, the Einstein Telescope, and maximize scientific output of prototype detectors in Australia and Japan.
0966609	The Market as a Commons Workshop: Developing a Comparative Framework for Investigating Cultural Resources in Regional Economies	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY	07/01/2010	06/25/2010	Rudolf Colloredo-Mansfeld	NC	University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill	Standard Grant	John E. Yellen	06/30/2012	$27,768.00		rudi-colloredo@unc.edu	104 AIRPORT DR STE 2200	CHAPEL HILL	NC	275991350	9199663411	SBE	1390	1390	$0.00	With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Colloredo-Mansfeld will host twenty-one scholars in a two-day workshop that examines how communities use cultural assets in order to develop local economies.  In particular, the workshop will assess how theories of the commons that explain natural resource systems can be adapted to investigate cultural resources.  Indeed, unique, heritage-based resources have found prominence in the global economy.  Many communities have sought legal protection for place-based crops, handcrafted commodities or ethnically identified wares. Other communities turn to cultural claims to restore economic value to traditional manufacture and commercial trades.  The workshop aims to build an analytical framework that will allow comparison across such regional economies.  The two day gathering will bring together an international group of scholars from the United States, England, Belgium and Australia who are currently researching artisan communities, indigenous cultural heritage, local food economies, and natural resource commons. Participants will divide their effort into four primary sessions: (1) the identification and valuation of cultural assets; (2) the description of interactions that generate cultural assets; (3) the place-based strategies that link culture and economy and shape the defense of regional trades; and (4) moderated round table discussions to narrow a research agenda and enable collaborative research projects.  <br/><br/>The central intellectual task is to connect research on local trades to the commons literature. Writers on law, popular culture, indigenous heritage, and technology, have embraced the idea of the commons to explain the importance and vulnerability of shared resources in a globally connected economy.  However, work needs to address the crucial differences between assets that form within market systems themselves and forests, fisheries and pastures that stand apart from markets and become exploited as their products gain economic value. Participants in the workshop will develop the analytical terms to describe cultural resources, identify patterns of competition and cooperation that build these shared assets, and document rules, settings, and strategies used to defend resources against appropriation by powerful outsiders or over-exploitation by local producers. The objective is to articulate practical research questions that will allow researchers to return to their field sites and data sets to assess the use of cultural assets and compare their results.    <br/><br/>This workshop will set up an international collaboration that contributes to training, engaged scholarship, and policy work. In practical terms, UNC-Chapel Hill's Center for Integrating Research and Action (CIRA) will both provide support for the dissemination of project-related research and serve to promote graduate training rooted in the workshop's models. More broadly, the planned follow-up for the workshop in terms of research, a symposium, and publication will enable pathways of participation for other scholars, policy makers and potential graduate students seeking to engage and evaluate the workshop's model.

Admin.	Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	MPS	1289	0000, 7483, 7969, OTHR	$0.00	The project will focus on tests of fundamental symmetries using spin-polarized atoms. A co-magnetometer using K, Rb and Ne-21 atoms will be developed to search for violations of CPT and Lorentz symmetries. Using Ne-21 atoms with a nuclear spin of 3/2 will allow searches for anomalous interactions that preserve CPT but violate Lorentz symmetry. Very high energy resolution of the co-magnetometer will also allow searches for anomalous spin-spin and spin-mass forces, placing new constraints on axions and other proposed light particles. It is anticipated that the experimental sensitivity in many cases will be limited by quantum fluctuations and a separate set of experiments will be conducted to understand these limits in dense alkali-metal vapors.<br/><br/>Successful completion of these experiments will result in new constraints on a number of proposed theories seeking to explain dark matter and dark energy in the Universe and to develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory of gravity. It will also result in development of new measurement techniques for magnetic fields and inertial rotation, with possible applications beyond physics. In particular, detection of individual single-domain nano-particles at low concentrations will enable new single molecule counting experiments in biology. A number if graduate, undergraduate and high-school students will be trained in various research techniques, ranging from construction of ultra-low noise electronics to interpretation of atomic measurements in the context of particle physics.

Such research is timely and<br/>needed to interpret pedo-geologic records of global change, and to forecast the effects of terrestrial C sequestration on the global CO2 cycle and soil sustainability in a human-altered world. The PIs overarching concept is that plant-driven weathering rates and mechanisms vary, depending on geologic setting and ecosystem phase. They focused on primary-successional settings, where plants must extract nutrients from soils by chemical weathering. The premise is that a key adaptation of many plants to these conditions is development of mycorrhizospheric biofilms, which attach the root system to mineral surfaces and micro-localize the biology, chemistry, and hydrology of weathering and nutrient uptake at the root system-mineral interface. At this micron scale, dissolution and biological mass transfers occur over very small distances and in relative isolation from bulk soil water, thereby increasing macroscopic nutrient acquisition efficiency and decreasing nutrient loss in drainage. The central hypothesis is that varying degrees<br/>of nutrient limitation (i.e., the need to extract base cations from mineral sources) influence biofilm development and weathering/uptake function. To address this hypothesis, the PIs propose to use replicated ectomycorrhizal seedling systems in a growth experiment, and vary the availability of Ca and K in bulk soil water and primary minerals by manipulating irrigation solutions and initial mineral composition. This research will provide insights into the mechanisms that link micron-scale processes of mineral weathering to ecosystem-scale processes of nutrient acquisition and ultimately global-scale processes of continental denudation.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Eight undergraduate students will work on this project. Because of the unique combination of researchers, students will be drawn from a community college, a four-year undergraduate college, and two research universities. The proposed research will foster a collaborative network of scientists that includes Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the US Forest Service, the Agricultural Research Service, and academic institutions. The results will be disseminated to science networks including the Critical Zone Exploration Network and the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study, and introduced to the general public through teaching and learning modules designed for middle and high school classrooms. Ultimately, this work will serve as a foundation for improving plant nutrition and soil sustainability, and better understanding terrestrial and hydrospheric carbon sequestration.

Steven Lundblad and Peter Mills, in collaboration with staff of the Bishop Museum, will conduct an extensive provenance study of stone from previously excavated, pre-contact habitation sites in Hawai`i. It is the first large evaluation of these materials using non-destructive Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF). This program will build upon pioneering geochemical work done over the past 20 years as well as on recent work in the UHH geoarchaeology laboratory on Hawaiian lithic (stone) artifacts.<br/><br/>The settlers of the Hawaiian Islands appear to have rapidly developed from a small initial colonizing population to the most complex chiefdom in all of Polynesia between circa AD 800-1000 and 1778. This study will address relationships between natural resources and culture which combined to result in this rapid intensification. Due to the lack of other mineral resources on these island chains, much of the work of deciphering ancient Oceanic economic and cultural history is based on the types and abundances of durable artifacts. These are mainly stone tools and debris from tool manufacture found at domestic sites. Studying the nature of quarrying activity and the distribution of products from quarry sites provides a framework for interpreting the role of natural resources in Hawaiian economies and social evolution. <br/><br/>Economic exchange studies based upon microscopic and geochemical analyses of lithics, however, have only just begun to address issues of geochemical variability within larger quarry sites and to identify the geochemistry of smaller source areas. This project will result in the first significant and systematic geochemical analysis of artifacts from domestic archaeological contexts spanning the Hawaiian archipelago. EDXRF provides a means for this large-scale, sustained, and non-destructive effort which will lead to more robust models of Hawaiian exchange and consequent sociopolitical development in relationship to valued natural resources across time.<br/><br/>Specific components supported by this project, which will span a two-year period, include the following phases. Quarry site sampling in the Hawaiian Islands will allow mapping of the geochemical signatures of the stone tool sources. Comparing these to the geochemical and technological analyses of the existing, well-documented collections of finished stone tools from the Bishop Museum will show the provenance of those tools. Researchers will develop models of natural resource exploitation patterns through time, and relate them to the evolution of Hawai`i's complex chiefdoms. These three phases all include the primary goal of education of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islander students. Students will participate through an integrated education program, with undergraduate research internships for anthropology and geology majors at UH-Hilo in collaboration with the Bishop Museum (Honolulu). <br/><br/>The use of non-destructive EDXRF analyses is not new, but its use to build an expansive geochemical database on Hawaiian stone acquisition is. This novel use in a large-scale, focused effort will apply new research to existing archived archaeological collections. The non-destructive nature of the new analysis will set the new standard for culturally appropriate methodologies for understanding the Hawaiian past. The study will provide exciting opportunities for Pacific Islander students to explore how their ancestors interacted with their environment and each other. Interpretation of exchange patterns based on this information will engender further insights into culturally significant activities of the past, which is of great interest to modern Hawaiians. The study will provide the framework to develop robust socio-economic models of the underpinnings, development, and social complexity of Polynesian chiefdoms.

The eye and visual system has long been recognized as a fascinating and uniquely informative model in which to explore how sensory structures develop. Vision is a highly specialized sensory function that demands an exquisitely organized and highly structured neural system, and it is this precision that creates an ideal experimental system to uncover principles of development and evolution. The community of scientists who study development of the eye and visual system have come to rely on the Visual System Development GRC as a 'must attend' event that provides a high level of information and a valuable forum for exchange.<br/> The aim of the Gordon Research Conference on Visual System Development is to bring together investigators studying the development, disease, and the evolution of the visual system. The meeting provides an environment that stimulates discussion and interaction across disciplines and among students, early-career investigators and leaders in the field. The goals of this biennial conference are to generate an understanding of common principles that regulate visual system development in diverse species, to share the latest and most exciting new results, and to stimulate new ideas and collaborations that impact our understanding of eye development. In addition, through this meeting there is an effort to apply our growing knowledge of eye development and maturation to the fields of regeneration and stem cell biology. Support from the NSF will help enable outstanding young scientists to attend this high-profile international meeting, to present their research findings to the international scientific community, and to interact with the leaders in the field. In particular, the funds requested from NSF will be used to facilitate participation by U.S. students and postdocs from a variety of backgrounds.

Currently, the mechanism by which clusters Kv2.1 are regulated and maintained is unknown. The project focuses on the biophysics of Kv2.1 voltage-gated K+ channel cell surface dynamics with particular emphasis on cytoskeleton-membrane interactions in live cells. The overall goal of the research is to improve our understanding of the mechanism by which the cortical cytoskeleton functionally forms a diffusion limiting fence that selectively corrals a sub-population of Kv2.1 channels. The specific research aims are: (1) characterize the dynamics of clustered and non-clustered channels within various surface regions of cultured neurons, (2) measure the influence of the cortical cytoskeleton and raft microdomains on Kv2.1 channel dynamics, (3) build a microscope to implement high-speed particle tracking and optical tweezers, and (4) determine the mechanism that forms Kv2.1 clusters on the cell surface. This experimental work will lead to unique insights in the molecular mechanism of membrane protein dynamics. The project focuses on investigating Kv2.1 clustering regulation, dynamics and interactions with the cytoskeleton which may lead to improved treatments for acute ischemic stroke through enhanced neuro-protective approaches. The research program will be integrated with an educational component by building an optical tweezers setup for educational purposes. Under-represented students will be recruited at minority meetings and through a Women & Minorities in Engineering Program at Colorado State University.<br/><br/>The project is jointly sponsored by the Physics and the Molecular Cell Biology Divisions at NSF.

It seeks a better understanding of (i) what controls the partitioning of the circulation between these dry and moist branches, (ii) how does this partitioning affect the energy and momentum transport by the circulation, (iii) what are the implications at the level of the individual storm, and (iv) how this might change in the future either as a result of natural climate variability or as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. <br/><br/>The approach here is based on analyzing the zonal mean circulation averaged on either dry isentropes, i.e., surfaces of constant potential temperature, or moist isentropes, i.e., surfaces of constant equivalent potential temperature. The research includes theoretical development to assess the role of moist processes on the dynamics of mid-latitude weather systems, numerical simulations of baroclinic life-cycle and of the global atmosphere, and a comprehensive study of the current circulation based on reanalysis datasets. A set of diagnostic tools to assess the isentropic circulation in numerical models will also be developed and made available to the broader community.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the proposed research are in the potential to improve our ability to predict how climate change can affect subtropical and mid-latitude weather, and modify the global distribution of rainfall. Different global climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will be carefully evaluated and compared to reanalysis data. This should both indicate possible ways to improve these models, as well as increase our confidence in their ability to accurately simulate the climate system and the hydrological cycle.

Roth<br/>University of Arizona<br/><br/>This study will examine the effects of medical malpractice suits, tort laws, health insurance, and reproductive regulations on birth practices in the United States. The research will test organizational theories about how legal regulations and insurance practices affect practices in health care. The study will focus specifically on cesarean sections because many healthcare industry insiders view cesareans as a form of defensive medicine, although the effects of malpractice and health insurance on cesareans are unclear. The research design combines quantitative analysis of how cesarean deliveries vary across states and over time in relation to malpractice, health insurance, and reproductive laws, with qualitative analysis of 30-40 interviews with important stakeholders in maternity care (providers, liability insurers, health insurers, and malpractice attorneys). The study's broader impacts include uncovering any non-medical influences on maternity care which may reveal ways to reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, and offering insights into the cost of maternity care. The results will have policy implications for improving maternity care and lowering healthcare costs.

These clouds are generally mixed-phase; the combination of ice, liquid and water vapor presents challenges both to measurements and modeling, and consequently, to understanding their impact on atmospheric radiation and on precipitation. The Colorado Airborne Multi-Phase Cloud Study (CAMPS) will use the Wyoming King Air research aircraft instrumented with both remote (cloud radar and cloud lidar) and in situ sensors (cloud and particle probes, total water hygrometer) to elucidate the vertical and horizontal structure of cold mixed-phase clouds.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/><br/>The data gathered during CAMPS will include information about macro- and microphysical parameters of mixed-phase clouds obtained by both in situ and remote-sensing methods. These data will be analyzed to address a number of important questions about the structure, properties and impacts of mixed-phase clouds. Specific goals include:<br/><br/>1. To assess the vertical and horizontal structure and spatial and temporal variation of cloud properties (particle size distribution, ice and liquid water content, particle habit) in liquid, mixed-phase and precipitating clouds at a mid-latitude continental site with complex terrain during winter.<br/><br/>2. To assess the impact of topography and associated variations in vertical forcing on cloud generation and cloud properties.<br/><br/>3.

0965147	Firm IQ: A Universal, Uniform and Reliable Measure of R&D Effectiveness	SBE	SCIENCE OF SCIENCE POLICY	06/15/2010	06/09/2010	Anne Marie Knott	MO	Washington University	Standard Grant	Julia I. Lane	09/30/2011	$149,509.00		knott@wustl.edu	CAMPUS BOX 1054	Saint Louis	MO	631304862	3147474134	SBE	7626	7626, 7969	$0.00	Despite the dramatic impact of R&D on firm and economic growth, there currently are no good measures of R&D effectiveness at the firm level. The most prevalent measure, patent counts, suffers from problems of universality (less than 50% of firms conducting R&D have any patents), uniformity (10% of U.S patents account for 81-85% of the economic value of all US patents) and reliability (patents are a poor predictor of firm market value). <br/><br/>Without a good measure of effectiveness, it is difficult to characterize the impact of R&D investment, to understand the mechanisms through which R&D investments generate economic outcomes, or to generate tools guiding future investment. What firms, policy makers and academics need is a universal, uniform and reliable measure of R&D effectiveness. That measure should match constructs in economic theory (so academics can test them) and should provide guidance to firms and policy-makers about the choice of investment levels. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Recent empirical methods have facilitated a new measure of R&D effectiveness using firm accounting data that is based in economic theory. This measure has the potential of predicting both firms' behavior and their market value. The measure is called IQ because it captures firms' technical problem solving capability in much the same way individual IQ captures analytical problem solving capability: those with higher IQ solve more problems per unit of input (dollars for firms, minutes for individuals) than those with lower IQ. Perhaps most importantly, firm IQ (unlike individual IQ) appears to be mutable over long periods of time. Accordingly, understanding the organizational structures and processes driving differences in IQ offers the potential for firms to improve their R&D effectiveness. <br/><br/>Work to date has estimated the IQ for publicly-traded US firms, characterized variation of IQ across industries, and identified high and low IQ firms within each industry. <br/><br/>This pilot study represents the first stage in an effort to characterize the organizational configurations and processes driving IQ. The pilot comprises in-depth interviews with paired firms (one high IQ, one low IQ) in two industries. These interviews form the basis of rich case studies of the four firms, as well as identify candidate factors/organizational configurations to examine in a future quantitative study across the full spectrum of firms engaged in R&D.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: There are both immediate and long term benefits from this study. The immediate benefits of the IQ measure are 1) academics' use of the measure to resolve empirical anomalies in prior studies, 2) firms' use of the measure to compute their optimal R&D investment, and 3) policymakers' use of the measure to allocate funds based on firmer evidence. The longer term benefit from the full study (to be disseminated via conference presentations, journal articles and ultimately a book for practitioners) is advancing understanding about the effectiveness of R&D investments.

The research team develops a statistical model for scene interpretations and image measurements. One component of the model is a prior distribution on a huge interpretation vector. Each bit of this vector represents a high-level scene attribute with widely varying degrees of specificity and resolution ? some are very coarse (general hypotheses) and some are very fine (specific hypotheses). The other component is a simple conditional data model for a corresponding family of learned binary classifiers, one per bit. The scene interpretation is then computed by assessing hypotheses in a highly coarse-to-fine manner, using an image parsing algorithm called ?entropy pursuit? based on stepwise uncertainty reduction, and classifiers for detecting events in spatiotemporal volumes which leverage on recent advances at the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems. The computational models and scene parsing algorithms developed in this project are broadly applicable to scene interpretation problems arising in many areas of science and engineering. Specific applications include home surveillance and security, assisted home living, infant and elderly care, etc. The project also provides research opportunities for graduate students in underrepresented minorities and even high school students.

A large component of the research is aimed at the numerical solution of Einstein's equations by supercomputer simulations. One focus is to track the coalescence and merger of binary black hole systems and to calculate the gravitational waveform emitted by such processes. These processes are primary targets for gravitational wave detectors now being deployed, like LIGO, and there is an urgent need for reliable waveforms. The numerical solution of this problem has proved to be remarkably difficult, but recent breakthroughs have led to spectacular progress.  The investigators will use a computational technique, pseudospectral collocation, that delivers high accuracy with a much smaller computational cost than other techniques. A second focus of the research is to study the coalescence and merger of binary systems containing a neutron star and a black hole, or two neutron stars. These are also prime scientific targets for LIGO. The third project is to study r-modes in neutron stars. These are a kind of oscillation of neutron stars, named for their similarity to Rossby waves in the Earth's atmosphere. The investigators will determine the effect of these oscillations on setting the spin rate of observed pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, and whether they can lead to detectable signals for LIGO.<br/><br/>This research will have a broad impact on our understanding of fundamental physics. There are currently no real tests of general relativity in the strong field regime of black holes. For experiments like LIGO to confront theory with observation, one must be able to calculate what the theory predicts. Are the black holes that LIGO may observe the black holes predicted by Einstein's theory? The research will also have an impact on the broader area of computational science. The computational techniques to be developed here can be used to solve problems in many other areas, including fluid dynamics, meteorology, seismology, and astrophysics. Young researchers trained in these techniques are in great demand.

It was recently discovered by the PI that ivy secretes nanoparticles for surface affixing. The adhesive force from the combination of the ivy nanoparticles and the mucopolysaccharide secreted from ivy has been demonstrated in the literature to be one of the largest forces per area in natural surface adhesion. By characterizing the role and discovering the chemical structure of the ivy adhesive nanoparticles, we will develop a nature-based nanoparticle for medical adhesive. Previous research undertaken by the PI regarding ivy nanopartciles has led to a prototype method to isolate the ivy nanoparticles, and to determine the adhesive strength of the nanoparticles using atomic force microscopy. These studies indicated that the adhesive had properties that could be translated into a nature-based nanoparticle for medical adhesive. This proposal aims to advance the preliminary studies, to completely characterize the nanoparticles, to understand toxicity of the nanoparticles and to investigate a prototype approach for synthesizing the ivy nanoparticles. The specific aims of this research are to 1) isolate nanoparticles from aerial rootlets of English ivy, 2) characterize the adhesive properties and toxicity of the ivy nanoparticles for medical applications, and 3) investigate a prototype approach for synthesizing the ivy nanoparticles.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: A great amount of research is currently being undertaken on the use of nanoparticles for a variety of biomedical applications including targeted drug delivery, molecular imaging and high strength biomaterials. By biomimicking the role of ivy nanoparticles for adhesive, this research introduces the first nature-based organic nanoparticle that can be used for a variety of biomedical applications including medical adhesive, sunscreen cancer prevention and targeted drug delivery. At present, nearly all nanoparticles synthesized are metal nanoparticles that have inherent toxicity in mammalian systems. A biological nanoparticle will be able to avoid much of the toxicity associated with metal-based nanoparticles and expand the application of nanoparticles to medicine. In addition, this research will provide a protocol approach for isolating nanoparticles from a variety of biological species including ivy, sundew and marine mussels. Finally, this research will contribute to the development of nanoparticle enhanced polymers for high strength nanocomposites, and provide useful information on a biological method for creating nanocomposite for strong adhesives.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research has broad impacts on biomaterial design through biomimetics, naturebased organic nanoparticle manufacturing and biomedical applications of nanoparticles for skin cancer prevention as well as drug delivery. Pharmaceutical fields have long recognized the importance of observing natural processes, to find the simplest and the most efficient way to develop drugs. Biomedical engineering is turning to biomimetics for finding ways to synthesize and develop complex nanostructure and devices for medicine. The fields benefitted by this research include material sciences, molecular biology, plant biology, bioengineering and nanomedicine. The results of this research will be used to extend our departmental curricula into nanomedicine and biomimetics for biomedical engineering innovation, and to be integrated into one of the core biomedical engineering graduate courses entitled nano bio-systems and biomimetics. This project will also be used as a foundation for local educational outreach in middle and high schools, and to draw interest into interdisciplinary sciences at early ages. Already these studies have encouraged both graduate students and undergraduates working in the labs to take interdisciplinary courses. We expect to develop an interdisciplinary curriculum across the university with the goal of training an interdisciplinary core of researchers. The PI's lab commits strongly to minority student training.

The instruments will reside at WHOI but their use will eventually be open to the community.<br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>This project will involve persons with disabilities by collaborating with CapeAbilities, a non-profit organization on Cape Cod, to have its clients assist in the manufacture of the sensor electrodes. Additionally, the research enabled by these instruments will have direct societal relevance in that the seismogenic zone of Cascadia represents a significant geologic hazard in a highly populated region of North America. The proponents also express a strong desire to entrain new students into the MT field, which has been criticized as lagging behind other countries.
0952216	Collaborative Research: Examining the Evolution of Biospheric Oxygenation in Late Archean to Middle Proterozoic Oceans Through High-Resolution Trace Metal Chemostratigraphy	EAR	GEOBIOLOGY & LOW TEMP GEOCHEM, GLOBAL CHANGE	07/01/2010	08/11/2012	Ariel Anbar	AZ	Arizona State University	Continuing grant	Enriqueta Barrera	06/30/2014	$152,135.00	Brian Kendall	anbar@asu.edu	ORSPA	TEMPE	AZ	852816011	4809655479	GEO	7295, 1577	OTHR	$0.00	Intellectual merit: The PIs propose to obtain high-resolution trace metal geochemical profiles from organic-rich sedimentary rocks to examine the evolution of climate and biospheric oxygenation in the Late Archean to Middle Proterozoic. The connections between climate and oxygenation are manifold. Oxygen levels in the deep sea are affected by the rate at which organic carbon is exported from productive surface waters, and hence ultimately from atmospheric CO2. In turn, enhanced burial of organic carbon in marine sediments can increase the O2 content of the atmosphere, with climatic consequences on an Archean Earth dependent on CH4 as a greenhouse gas. Oxygen levels also affect the ocean concentrations of trace nutrients such as Fe and Mo, potentially altering the vigor of marine surface biota and the efficiency of surface-to-deep carbon pumping. Earlier work by the PIs discovered traces of oxygenic photosynthesis and surface ocean oxygenation at least 50-100 M.y. before the first major rise of atmospheric O2 (2.45-2.32 Ga Great Oxidation Event; GOE). Their chemostratigraphic approach revealed an otherwise unrecognized history of biospheric oxygenation that is more complex than previously realized. Therefore, detailed investigation of this history allows them to test fundamental concepts that relate O2, carbon, micronutrients and climate. For example, can the same basic concepts developed to explain Holocene climate and carbon cycling explain conditions in the Archean and Proterozoic? The PIs propose to refine the timeline of biospheric oxygenation by developing an extensive compilation of trace metal concentrations for Late Archean to Middle Proterozoic rocks emphasizing key intervals straddling the GOE: the 2.7 Ga Joy Lake Sequence (Minnesota, U.S.A.), the 2.3 Ga Rooihoogte and Timeball Hill Formations (South Africa), and the 1.8-1.7 Ga Chuanlinggou Formation (North China). Trace metal geochemical profiles, when combined with sedimentary Fe geochemistry, can constrain the nature of local sedimentary conditions (e.g., bottom water redox state and basin restriction). Bottom water Mo concentrations in ancient oceans can be estimated by comparing Mo/TOC of these rock samples with sediment Mo/TOC and seawater concentrations in modern anoxic basins. For other trace metals whose marine geochemistry is less well understood, broad differences in metal marine budgets between time intervals can be made by comparison with Mo. The Mo isotope paleoredox proxy will be used to procure independent constraints on the extent of regional/global water column euxinia and assess the impact on trace metal abundances in seawater. Re-Os geochronology may provide precise depositional ages. <br/><br/>The PIs will address four main questions: <br/>1. How long is the time lag between the development of pervasive surface ocean oxygenation (and by inference oxygenic photosynthesis) and the GOE? <br/>2. What is the response of early Paleoproterozoic metal marine budgets to the GOE? <br/>3. Do metal marine budgets show temporal trends in the Middle Proterozoic related to increasing biospheric O2 and/or expansion of ocean euxinia?<br/>4. What implications do such trends have for climate during the early Earth and how was microbial and eukaryotic ecology and evolution affected?<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impact: This proposal promotes the early career development of Co-PI Kendall. Additionally, as a component of their project activities, the PIs plan to establish a pilot project that will provide laboratory research experience for ASU undergraduates with physical disabilities (i.e., vision, hearing, speech, or motor impairments). The ultimate goal of the pilot is to increase access to science laboratories for postsecondary students with disabilities. It will also leverage the experiences of Kendall as a successful young laboratory scientist with severe hearing and mild speech impairments. Specific programs will be crafted for each student in collaboration with the ASU Disability Resource Center (DRC). The DRC will provide classroom aids and assistive technologies to facilitate direct student participation in laboratory research activities, including sample preparation, analysis, data reduction, and preparation of undergraduate theses.

This project aims to clarify what underlies this difference by testing to what extent a language learner's problems with sentence processing are related to 1) the lack of detailed word knowledge and rapid access word-level information, and 2) the reader's ability to suppress irrelevant information in general. Native speakers and second-language learners will be closely compared. The proposed project is a collaboration between the University of Florida (USA), the University of Utrecht (The Netherlands), and the Universidad De La Laguna (Spain), and will test native speakers of English, native speakers of Spanish, Dutch learners of English, and English learners of Spanish. <br/><br/>Results from this project may lead to a better understanding of how second-language learners comprehend written language and why certain individuals experience more problems than others when learning a second language. Outcomes of this project may inform research on language education and intervention techniques. This will ultimately benefit minority populations learning English as a second language, as well as populations with language impairments. Finally, the project will be integrated into the linguistics curriculum at University of Florida and will create international research opportunities for students to gain hands-on experience with psycholinguistic and electrophysiological research. <br/><br/>This work is co-funded by SBE/BCS and the Office of International Science and Engineering

The project will explore new particle systems for affinity enrichment and new surface modification approaches to extend metal phosphonate-based enrichment strategies to on-target techniques. The new mechanisms and materials will be evaluated using surface analytical methods to quantify the activity of the new materials toward different phosphopeptide structures. Finally, newly developed systems will be tested to prove their applicability to phosphoprotein mass spectrometry.<br/><br/>These experiments seek to devise new means of isolating a wide range of biomaterials that are important in high-technology applications ranging from sensing and diagnostics to enabling fundamental studies of proteins - a fundamental building block of life. In addition, training related to biomaterials, interfaces, chemical measurement, and protein chemistry will provide graduate and undergraduate students with the skills and knowledge needed to be competitive in biotechnology related high-technology professions. The project also fosters collaboration with international partners at the UniversitÈ de Nantes in France. This cooperation includes an extensive international educational component through the exchange of graduate student researchers. These exchanges are designed to facilitate thesis work and to also provide students with important alternative perspectives on research and approaches to scientific exploration.
0954643	PECASE: Using Control Systems to Quantify Limbic Dysregulation for Neurobiologically-Based Diagnoses of Psychiatric Disabilities	CBET	Disability & Rehab Engineering, ENG DIVERSITY ACTIVITIES	07/01/2010	03/10/2015	Lilianne Mujica-Parodi	NY	SUNY at Stony Brook	Standard Grant	Michele Grimm	06/30/2016	$478,035.00		lilianne.strey@stonybrook.edu	WEST 5510 FRK MEL LIB	Stony Brook	NY	117940001	6316329949	ENG	5342, 7680	010E, 1045, 1187, 7974, 9102	$0.00	PI: Mujica-Parodi, Lilianne<br/>Proposal Number: 0954643<br/><br/>PROJECT SUMMARY<br/>Intellectual Merit: For this proposal, we will develop and test computational methods for quantifying dysregulation between the excitatory and inhibitory components of the negative feedback loops in the brain that control homeostatic regulation of emotional arousal. This work conceptually integrates systems neuroscience with techniques originally developed for physics and engineering (power spectrum scale invariance, Shannon entropy) that have been successfully applied towards characterizing autonomic regulation via heart-rate variability analysis. Historically, neuroimaging has focused on measuring the amplitude of activation-levels in different regions of interest for some specific task. While in the past few years newer connectivity methods such as structural equation modeling, Granger causality, and dynamic causal modeling are important advances in investigating the temporal components of the time-series, these techniques are designed to investigate the strength of connections between node pairs. In contrast, our approach builds upon this work to answer a completely different type of question: to what degree does the system as a whole respond efficiently to perturbation in its maintenance of homeostasis? Our approach is explicitly motivated by the fact that many diseases-from diabetes to cancer to Cushing's disease-are dysregulatory in nature. As such, one technique that has enjoyed much diagnostic success is to perturb the system and then measure dynamic features of its return to baseline. In this proposal, we measure dysregulation of the limbic circuit, with neural timeseries obtained first from functional MRI and then near-infrared spectroscopy, in developing a neurobiologically-based instrument for objective and quantitative diagnosis of mental illness. The three patient groups with whom we will optimize our methods will include generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, and their comorbidity. These diagnostic choices provide a rational extension of our previous research on limbic dysregulation as a marker for individual variability in trait anxiety within the healthy population. Moreover, the symptoms associated with anxiety and depression have clearly-defined excitatory and inhibitory components with respect to physiological and behavioral arousal, and therefore will allow us to test dissociation between groups. The development of engineering techniques to assist individuals with psychiatric illness qualifies this proposal for consideration in the RAPD category as it advances innovation beyond the frontiers of current knowledge in disability-related research of mental illness. Given that psychiatric illnesses are currently diagnosed solely by clinicians' assessment of patients' self-reported moods, and therefore are highly subjective and wholly dependent upon patient compliance, the broad societal impact of this research lies in the potential ability to harness the functional neuroimaging technologies for applications that could be revolutionary in the diagnosis of mental health disorders, providing objective and quantifiable criteria for assessing prodromal risk, treatment efficacy, and identifying clean phenotypes for genetic research. This CAREER award would permit me, over the next five years, to collect the necessary data and to iteratively develop and adapt the computational engineering tools necessary to lead development in this critical evolving area of research.<br/>Broader Impact: In 2007, the National Academy of Science, National Academy of Engineering, and<br/>Institute of Medicine were charged by Congress to form a committee to address the challenges associated with maintaining scientific innovation and economic competitiveness within an increasingly global economy. For this CAREER award, I will focus on addressing two specific recommendations made by this committee. One action item was to strengthen children's K-12 preparation in science and technology by enhancing the science and engineering education of the science teachers themselves. A second action item was to increase the total number of individuals qualified and motivated to pursue postgraduate study in science and engineering. This CAREER award will directly address both of these action items. The first action item will be addressed in three parts: (1) through the development of a fun and intellectually engaging hands-on 7th grade curriculum in systems-based thinking using STELLA software; (2) through training science teachers to use the curriculum during summer workshops; and, (3) through dissemination of the curriculum and workshop materials by posting them on our website and follow-up assessment to measure the curriculum's efficacy. The second action item will be addressed by setting up a collaborative program with the Georgia Institute of Technology Department of Biomedical Engineering to recruit minority biomedical engineers into our Biomedical Engineering Ph.D. program: first as summer-research undergraduates, and then as full-time students. By training students in the lab to exploit the benefits of thinking in terms of systems in their own research, and then training them to teach teachers and by extension junior high school students the same conceptual tools at a more basic level, we are able to integrate our research and educational goals to the fullest extent possible.

Elekonich	06/30/2016	$560,000.00		getsmith@indiana.edu	509 E 3RD ST	Bloomington	IN	474013654	8128550516	BIO	7659	1228, 9178, 9179, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	Sexually dimorphic communication signals evolve rapidly and are among the most widespread, diverse, and conspicuous behaviors that animals produce. This project will combine evolutionary and physiological approaches to study how sexual differentiation of the brain evolves in relation to sex differences in behavior. The project will address this question by comparatively studying mechanisms that regulate sexual dimorphic signals in a species-rich family of South American electric fish. These animals generate weak electrical signals to communicate information about species, sex, social rank, and motivation. The magnitude and direction of sex differences in electric communication signals vary across species. Sex differences in these signals are regulated by hormones like testosterone and estrogens and by neuromodulators like serotonin. The brain circuit that controls electric communication signals is well-characterized and relatively simple. These features facilitate investigations of how hormone-brain-behavior interactions evolved to produce species diversity in sexual dimorphic behavior.<br/>The project has four goals: (1) to compare sex differences in signals across species and investigate the coevolution of sex differences in different signal components; (2) to determine whether species diversity in sexual dimorphic behavior evolves through changes in the hormonal sensitivity of behavior; (3) to determine whether sex differences in behavior evolve through changes in neuromodulation in brain regions that control communication signals; and (4) to determine whether sex differences in behavior evolve through changes in the intrinsic physiology of brain cells.<br/>Undergraduates will help collect and analyze data and will be trained and encouraged to pursue scientific careers. The project will maintain a robust international collaboration between Indiana University and the National Institute of Amazon Research in Brazil. The project will generate recordings of electric communication signals that will be deposited in a public database and provide resources for research and teaching on animal communication, sex differences, biodiversity, sensory biology, and biophysics.

This unified approach brings together fields of Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Bioengineering to create an instrument for precisely measuring and visualizing significant information and results across the five dimensions, three from spatial data, time, and an imaging modality that serves as the fifth dimension. Accomplishing this mission involves advanced designs, hardware-software integration mechanisms, and novel interfaces that bring competing, and sometimes diverging, technologies into a unified brain research platform. Combining a Multi-site Data Repository, Modality Integration and Computational, Visualization, and Operation Support Units, this new instrument is expected to bring:<br/>- New insights into brain structure, functional correlations and dynamics, both in its normal state and under specific pathological conditions,<br/>- Far improved mapping of patterns of brain activity,<br/>- Integration of multimodal technologies in order to augment their capabilities with new insights while consolidating high spatial resolution with high temporal resolution,<br/>- Database design and management augmented with mechanisms for fast user interaction and visualization to meet the challenge of managing complex spatio-temporal datasets, posing complex queries, and establishing effective methods for data representation and visualization, and<br/>- Resolution of those paradigms that confront heavy computational requirements and compatibility problems that arise from the use of different recording modalities and diverse software platforms.<br/>The project aims to collectively overcome the primary barriers in identifying the different factors that influence the functional organization of the brain and its underlying pathology. As an example, it delves in the epileptic seizure that can be mapped over time as it moves along specific fiber tracts that may enable better identification of specific areas of treatment and consequently protect functionally important parts of the brain during surgery that may lead to better and safer outcomes.<br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>Fostering an environment that supports cross disciplinary initiatives, joint collaboration and programs, the instrument establishes a research platform that enables academic institutions and hospitals to investigate multi-site collaborative studies in accordance to systematically administered standardize protocols to a database of common assessments and measures. The project extends the breadth and depth of multidisciplinary efforts including new paradigms and findings. Moreover, the project advances the education, research, and training of many students in a minority serving university.
0963914	The Neural Correlates of Target Selection	BCS	COGNEURO	06/01/2010	04/09/2013	Preeti Verghese	CA	Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Foundation	Continuing grant	Alumit Ishai	08/31/2014	$465,055.00		preeti@ski.org	2318 Fillmore Street	San Francisco	CA	941151813	4153452035	SBE	1699	0000, 1699, OTHR	$0.00	When we interact with our surroundings we are often looking at or reaching for an object of interest that is embedded in the clutter of daily life. Successful interaction with our surroundings requires that several processes work in concert. These include image-related factors, such as, how the target of our reaching differs from its surroundings, visual processes that organize the scene into potential targets and background, and cognitive factors such as task demands and prior knowledge of target. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Preeti Verghese and her colleagues are investigating how all of these processes unfold over time, and how they interact to select a target on a textured background. Their research uses psychophysics, as well as high-density electroencephalography (EEG) combined with a process that localizes the cortical sources of the scalp potentials to determine the neural populations that implement these processes. The two aims address important questions about the interaction of selective attention and segmentation processes: When attention is directed to a target, how do the surrounding context and task requirements influence how efficiently the target is selected? What is the time course of this interaction: How does evidence for the target evolve over time, and how do attention and task demands influence the way in which a target is segmented from the background? <br/><br/>This study aims to understand the neural underpinnings of target selection in the real world. As such it has relevance to activities of daily life. It is also relevant to clinical populations with people who have difficulty with target selection. These include people with damage to parts of the visual cortex due to stroke, injury, or tumors that result in a diminished awareness of objects that are represented by the affected parts of the cortex. This visual neglect is particularly acute in the presence of other objects in the visual field. Training is also a strong component of this research program. This research project provides research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students to gain exposure to science as summer interns. Because the research is multidisciplinary, postdoctoral fellows are having the opportunity to train in research areas that complement their doctoral research.

Cache La Poudre St.	Colorado Springs	CO	809033243	7193896318	GEO	5112	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Intellectual Merit: <br/>This work will create a GIS-based repository of geological data sets from the Ford Ranges that will be made available via the Internet in both GIS and interactive web format. The proposed project will integrate the products of geological research with WorldView imagery and high resolution TMA photography available from the Antarctic Geospatial Information Center. The aims of the project are: 1) to develop an internet-based system for sharing of geological data, 2) associate these data with high resolution photography and imagery to extend analysis from areas of rock exposure to completely glaciated areas, and 3) to provide undergraduates with an exciting context in which to acquire fundamental skills and analytical experience in GIS together with an understanding of physical-chemical principles. The research will use GIS for inquiry and interpretation of a geological-glacial setting that has significance for climate, ice sheet, or tectonics in West Antarctica, augmented by in-depth study of published geological literature, through which students will learn to think critically, problem-solve, and experiment with methods and data sets in order to find solutions to contemporary scientific questions. This compilation of geological data and bedrock physical parameters is needed for the quantitative analysis of past paleotopography by ANTscape and Antarctic Climate Evolution scientists, and may be used as input data for continually more refined climate evolution and ice sheet models.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>As part of this work three undergraduates pursing senior theses will develop proficiency in GIS while exploring research questions about Antarctic climate evolution. This work will enable the scientific community to access an on-line repository of geological data from the Ford Ranges, West Antarctica that will be placed within the larger geospatial framework offered by satellite imagery. Interpretations of paleoelevations for selected regions and time intervals will be of broad use for climate/ice sheet modelers and glacial geologists. Petrological, geochronological, and structural data will be of value for solid earth scientists conducting work in segments of the former accretionary margin of Gondwana.

Bergbreiter at Texas A&M University for a research project that will use phase-selectively soluble polymer-bound catalysts in immiscible solvent mixtures to address important challenges in synthesis and catalysis and will have an effect on the areas of catalysis, synthesis, Green chemistry and polymer chemistry. The proposed research will extend the PI's past discoveries on the use of polymer-bound catalysts in homogeneous solutions to conduct reactions in oil-in-oil emulsions. The catalyst immobilization chemistry proposed is based principally on the properties of the soluble polymer support. Using chemistry developed in prior work will allow the preparation of a variety of homogeneous catalysts, and phase segregate and concentrate them in the discontinuous phase of oil-in-oil emulsions. Transesterification catalysts, organometallic catalysts and organocatalysts will all be studied. The reactions to be studied are macrocyclizations using several different methods such as transesterification, olefin metathesis, Baylis-Hilman reactions, and carboxylic acid additions to epoxides.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Bergbreiter will perform research that will not only apply to multiple types of macrocyclizations (lactones, epoxides, Baylis-Hilmman), but also include careful and clever studies designed to optimize reaction rates, catalyst recovery, and removal of catalysts from products. Professor Bergbreiter?s work has also had an impact in the technology arena where earlier work was the basis of a recently described process by DuPont for a commercially viable route to clearcoats containing low volatile organic compounds (VOC) for automotive finishing applications. Broader impacts of this work include the training of undergraduate, PhD, and postdoctoral students. Professor Bergbreiter has had success introducing undergraduates both from Texas A&M and elsewhere to research. His research program is expected to continue to involve a significant percentage of students from underrepresented groups. The current program included 34% women and 38% students from underrepresented groups among the undergraduates or graduate students who worked on the project. These percentages will increase to 50% in the future by targeting schools in Texas that serve underrepresented groups. International outreach will be achieved by working with an undergraduate institution in Qatar, and with universities in Japan and Thailand, which will broaden the cultural experiences of his students.

The proposed instrument will be compact, inexpensive and will require low power. It will be suitable for broad deployment on fixed platforms or on mobile observing vehicles such as gliders or tethered or autonomous underwater vehicles. The technological basis, imaging multivariate optical computing (IMOC), uses multivariate discrimination of unique components of a cell's fluorescence excitation spectra to create interference filters (Multivariate Optical Elements, or MOEs) that code for different phytoplankton species. Target phytoplankton cells are excited with a light source filtered through a rotating series of MOEs. The fluorescence response produces a classifying bar code in the image. Information on phytoplankton size is acquired by the instrument's use of imaging in a streak camera mode. Together, these will provide sufficient morphological and spectral analysis for classification and quantification. <br/><br/>In this next phase of the research they will: 1) field test of the shipboard instrument using natural phytoplankton populations, 2) continue production of interference filters for a wider range of phytoplankton taxa (for which we have already identified discriminant functions), and 3) acquire fluorescence excitation spectra that capture a wider range of variability in ambient light, macronutrient, and micronutrient environment.<br/><br/>Risk: an instrument that is successful in the simple lab environment may not be capable of discriminating amongst phytoplankton taxa in the more complex natural environment, or operations may be too difficult to allow commercialization.<br/><br/>Reward: If successful, this instrument would revolutionize our ability to study the base of the ocean food web, with affordable sensors available for all ocean moorings, gliders and AUVs. Such in-situ observations would be transformative for ecosystem studies in coastal and open ocean settings<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/><br/>This instrument has potential applications in both biological and chemical oceanography. Outside the societal benefits, the broader educational impacts of this work include the training of two undergraduate students, three graduate students, one postdoctoral fellow, and community outreach lectures. The undergraduates will be chosen on a competitive basis as part of the University of South Carolina Marine Science Program's Summer Undergraduate Research Assistant Program. Students will have a major role in the project work-load and would be provided with cross-discipline training opportunities.

The meeting is intended for attendees from French and U.S. institutions, including universities, research labs, industry and policy-makers from public and private sectors. The award will support the participation of up to 50 U.S. faculty and 20 U.S. students in the workshop. The workshop is organized by Global Engineering Program at PU and the scientific attachÈ of the French Consulate in Chicago. The NSF funding leverages support for the symposium from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and numerous French research institutions such as the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, and the Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement.<br/><br/>Global climate change and the related effects on water quantity and quality extremes impact the daily lives of millions of individuals and societies around the world. This is also the case in the United States and in France, where warning signs for the need of sustainable water management and food security tools and policies are surfacing. The symposium will develop new Franco-American partnerships for sustainable water management in agriculture that will lay the groundwork for improved research, education and development opportunities to address: (1) water resource management under water shortage/extremes; (2) impact of human activities on agricultural water quality and water quality impact of agricultural activities; (3) drinking water quality; (3) climate changes related issues and impact on ground water; (4) multi-scale water and land-use modeling and uncertainties; (5) integration of physical, sociological, social sciences to policy; (6) innovation in education; and (7) the enhancement of interaction and synergies between industries and academic institutions. These challenges are not unique to the partner countries. They go beyond their borders to impact food security, biodiversity and indigenous species, flood control, the interface of human activity (industry, agriculture, urbanization) and eco-systems, tools for accurate prediction and measurement of soil-climate-crop system interactions, and the education of globally competent scientist and engineers. This award is jointly supported by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering and the Hydrological Sciences Program.

The flow of water masses between the Bering Sea and the Arctic and Pacific oceans, changes in Arctic ice volume, and whether dense intermediate waters formed in the Pacific during this time will be investigated as some of the possible triggers of past climate change. The high resolution sediment records obtained from this cruise, with relatively large-amplitude signals, provide a unique opportunity to understand how insulation changes in the upper atmosphere propagate through the climate system and to further test if the orbital cycles of climate change primarily operate on 23ky versus 40 ky timescales. This study utilizes K % logging data from the cruise with paleomagnetic, sedimentological (eg., grain size analysis) and paleontological (eg., analysis of microfossil assemblages; d18O and d13C measurements of benthic and planktonic forams) measurements from the drill cores. The information expected from this study is critical for understanding the fundamental drivers and feedbacks between ice sheets, oceanic and atmospheric circulation and the global carbon cycle. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project significantly advances large investments previously made in an important IODP expedition. The data derived from this investigation can provide important information for paleoclimate/ocean models, and is relevant towards projections of future climate under IPCC AR4 scenarios. The project includes a team of early and mid-career scientists, and includes international collaborations with other scientists of the IODP community. Support is also provided for undergraduate and graduate education, and for public outreach and education.

The last several years have seen rapid advances in the development of new approaches for analysis of each step of gene expression. Many of these approaches involve a computational component in their design or interpretation, and it is clear that effective collaborations between experimental and computational biologists will be required to come to grips with the complex problem of gene regulation. To encourage free cross-disciplinary exchange of existing ideas and expertise, the meeting Systems Biology: Global regulation of gene expression will be held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on March 23-27, 2010. The meeting aims to provide a mechanism for the establishment of new collaborations, and a forum for discussing new experimental and computational approaches. Twenty-two speakers of international renown have been invited to give oral presentations, and approximately forty-five others will be selected from submitted abstracts from applicants to the meeting. This is a unique feature of Cold Spring Harbor meetings, and ensures that the scientific exchange is largely about unpublished results. Poster sessions will be included to encourage meaningful participation by the non-speaking attendees. In addition, pre-meeting workshops will be held to familiarize molecular biologists and bioinformaticians with the key concepts, terminology, and acronyms needed to understand each others' disciplines. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/> Past meetings have attracted a large number of female scientists, students, postdoctoral fellows and early-career investigators, and the current meeting promises to be no exception. One of the two keynote speakers, 25% of the remaining invited speakers, and two of the four meeting organizers are women, and funds provided by NSF will be used to support attendance by student, postdoctoral fellows, and minority participants.<br/><br/>This conference is co-funded by the Genes and Genome Systems and Cellular Systems Clusters.

Our approach is to jointly develop kinematic and dynamic models of lithosphere deformation in the western US to address a series of long-standing problems about how the lithosphere deforms including: 1. What is the mode of deformation in the western US? 2. What is the relative influence of various driving forces on lithosphere deformation? 3. What is the rheology of the lithosphere and how does rheology change with depth? 4. Is lithosphere deformation self-driving and decoupled from mantle flow? 5. Where is slip along faults aseismic and seismic? And, 6. To what extent do faults interact mechanically by transfer of loads through elastic and viscous processes in the lithosphere?<br/><br/>We are developing kinematic models of long-term and interseismic deformation that will be used to infer the viscosity structure of the lithosphere, fault slip rates, distribution of interseismic fault creep, and lithospheric block motions. To do this we are constructing 3D earthquake cycle models consisting of faults in an elastic schizosphere overlying a layered viscous plastosphere. We are examining the extent in space and time to which postseismic relaxation processes in the mantle and on deep crustal faults might be evident in GPS measurements of interseismic deformation and to what extent these processes influence our estimates of fault slip rates. We are also moving beyond purely kinematic models and developing thin-plate elasto-plastic models of long-term lithosphere deformation in which faults slide in response to far-field plate driving forces, internal body forces due to variations in gravitational potential energy, and basal tractions. Combining these predictions of long-term motions with our interseismic deformation models and GPS observations, we are trying to infer the relative contributions of the various driving forces to lithosphere deformation.

The innovative curriculum takes full advantage of college students' proficiency with networked communications (e.g., PDAs, cell phones, Facebook, Flickr, and Google Earth) while familiarizing them with field observations and research skills. Students are able to share their observations and data through various online sources by contributing to ongoing research about invasive plant species, plant diversity, plant phenology and plant-animal interactions. By evaluating the experiences, ideas, and attitudes of instructors and students using mobile technologies, this project can inform a wide range of educational institutions on adapting this unique approach for its own curriculum. For example, faculty at UMass Boston are evaluating the technology developed in the project in one day workshops with Boston Public School students and middle school teachers. Data collected and lessons learned are being disseminated via a public website called MobileTechnologiesForTeachingFieldCourses. Ultimately this project utilizes the advances in geospatial, mobile, and multimedia information technologies coalesced with their application to environmental science topics to benefit educational institutions of all levels, Citizen Science programs, and environmental non-government organizations.

Such research is timely and<br/>needed to interpret pedo-geologic records of global change, and to forecast the effects of terrestrial C sequestration on the global CO2 cycle and soil sustainability in a human-altered world. The PIs overarching concept is that plant-driven weathering rates and mechanisms vary, depending on geologic setting and ecosystem phase. They focused on primary-successional settings, where plants must extract nutrients from soils by chemical weathering. The premise is that a key adaptation of many plants to these conditions is development of mycorrhizospheric biofilms, which attach the root system to mineral surfaces and micro-localize the biology, chemistry, and hydrology of weathering and nutrient uptake at the root system-mineral interface. At this micron scale, dissolution and biological mass transfers occur over very small distances and in relative isolation from bulk soil water, thereby increasing macroscopic nutrient acquisition efficiency and decreasing nutrient loss in drainage. The central hypothesis is that varying degrees<br/>of nutrient limitation (i.e., the need to extract base cations from mineral sources) influence biofilm development and weathering/uptake function. To address this hypothesis, the PIs propose to use replicated ectomycorrhizal seedling systems in a growth experiment, and vary the availability of Ca and K in bulk soil water and primary minerals by manipulating irrigation solutions and initial mineral composition. This research will provide insights into the mechanisms that link micron-scale processes of mineral weathering to ecosystem-scale processes of nutrient acquisition and ultimately global-scale processes of continental denudation.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Eight undergraduate students will work on this project. Because of the unique combination of researchers, students will be drawn from a community college, a four-year undergraduate college, and two research universities. The proposed research will foster a collaborative network of scientists that includes Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the US Forest Service, the Agricultural Research Service, and academic institutions. The results will be disseminated to science networks including the Critical Zone Exploration Network and the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study, and introduced to the general public through teaching and learning modules designed for middle and high school classrooms. Ultimately, this work will serve as a foundation for improving plant nutrition and soil sustainability, and better understanding terrestrial and hydrospheric carbon sequestration.
0944578	Collaborative Research: Pleistocene East Antarctic Ice Sheet History as Recorded in Sediment Provenance and Chronology of High-elevation TAM Moraines	PLR	ANTARCTIC EARTH SCIENCES	06/01/2010	07/12/2011	Kathy Licht	IN	Indiana University	Standard Grant	Alexandra Isern	05/31/2013	$213,283.00	R. Jeffrey Swope	klicht@iupui.edu	509 E 3RD ST	Bloomington	IN	474013654	8128550516	GEO	5112	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Intellectual Merit<br/>The proposed work will investigate changes in the compositional variation of glacial tills over time across two concentric sequences of Pleistocene moraines located adjacent to the heads of East Antarctic outlet glaciers in the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM). The chronologic framework for this work will be generated from cosmogenic exposure ages of boulders on prominent morainal ridges. The PIs hypothesize that variations in till composition may indicate a change in ice flow direction or a change in the composition of the original source area, while ages of the moraines provide a long-term terrestrial perspective on ice sheet dynamics. Both results are vital for modeling experiments that aim to reconstruct the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and assess its role in the global climate system and its potential impact on global sea level rise. The variation of till compositions through time also allows for a more accurate interpretation of sediment cores from the Ross Sea and the Southern Ocean. Additionally, till exposures at the head of some East Antarctic outlet glaciers have been shown to contain subglacial material derived from East Antarctic bedrock, providing a window through the ice to view East Antarctica?s inaccessible bedrock. Till samples will be collected from two well-preserved sequences of moraine crests at Mt. Howe (head of Scott Glacier) and Mt. Achernar (between Beardmore and Nimrod Glaciers). Each size fraction in glacial till provides potentially valuable information, and the PIs will measure the petrography of the clast and sand fractions, quantitative X-ray diffraction on the crushed <2mm fraction, elemental abundance of the silt/clay fraction, and U/Pb of detrital zircons in the sand fraction. Data collection will rely on established methods previously used in this region and the PIs will also explore new methods to assess their efficacy. On the same moraines crests sampled for provenance studies, the PIs will sample for cosmogenic surface exposure analyses to provide a chronologic framework at the sites for provenance changes through time. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The proposed research involves graduate and undergraduate training in a diverse array of laboratory methods. Students and PIs will be make presentations to community and campus groups, as well as conduct interviews with local news outlets. The proposed work also establishes a new, potentially long-term, collaboration between scientists at IUPUI and LDEO and brings a new PI (Kaplan) into the field of Antarctic Earth Sciences.

Consequently, careful analysis of the results of major organizational innovations has considerable potential to inform and guide future decisions about their adoption.<br/><br/>This study examines whether and how innovations in management practices improve the functioning of complex organizations. Focusing on information technology (IT) management innovations in state governments, this study employs surveys and interviews in all 50 states to examine combinations of innovative IT management practices, the sequence and timing of practice adoption, and effects on state government performance. In-depth case studies will complement the population study to reveal the processes by which innovative practices can lead to performance improvements. <br/><br/> The need for better IT management is especially clear in government organizations, which continually struggle with the need to do more with less. This set of studies will help answer the question: under what conditions do innovative practices pay off in terms of better state government performance? The project emphasizes IT governance, IT architecture design, and IT procurement, because these practice areas are believed by experts to be most critical for improving the success of government IT projects. However, the findings will contribute to knowledge about innovation in management practices in general, not just to state governments. Study results will be disseminated both to academic researchers and to practitioners.

0963064	Collaborative Research: Development of a next generation sensor for measuring biologically available iron in seawater	OCE	OCEAN TECH & INTERDISC COORDIN	06/15/2010	12/10/2014	Karen Orcutt	MS	University of Southern Mississippi	Standard Grant	Kandace S.

The broad implications resulting from these dual effects range from impacts on the global carbon cycle to the possible stimulation of harmful algal blooms. There is a strong need for ultra-sensitive, real-time monitoring and detection technologies that capture the reactive iron pool in seawater that is available to eukaryotic phytoplankton.<br/><br/>The PI?s request funding to ?biocalibrate? the reactive iron fraction to gain a measure of iron availability to marine eukaryotic phytoplankton. The PI?s will combine Time Resolved Fluorescence (TRF) and Fluorescence Resonate Energy Transfer (FRET) to develop an ultra-sensitive photoactive nanodevice that uses the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFB) as the iron-selective sensor interface, lanthanide fluorescence to report the presence of iron in this receptor, and Q-dot nanocrystals to greatly amplify this signal to achieve the picomolar level sensitivity needed to study both coastal and offshore ocean waters<br/><br/>The sensor will be calibrated with a range of nearshore and offshore species of cyanobacteria, diatoms and dinoflagellates, and the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi; phytoplankton important in the regulation of carbon export from surface to the deep ocean. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a photoactive nanosensor that allows real-time in situ measurements that reflect phytoplankton growth rates.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/><br/>The development of new generation of sensor to measure labile iron in-situ will greatly advance our knowledge of iron biogeochemistry. In addition, due to extremely short response time, this sensor will provide a unique opportunity to measure iron kinetics, cycling which is one of the biggest challenge in this research area, believe to be critical to control iron bioavailability to phytoplankton. Therefore this project will certainly lead to the burgeoning of this research area, potentially leading to new findings. In addition to supporting graduate students and undergrads, this proposal involves middle school teachers. Orcutt has obviously established productive relationships with local educators, and the letters from these teachers outlining their enthusiasm for continuing the relationship gives confidence that the proposed work will lead to an effective educational outcome. The potential for involvement of minority students at Southern Miss. is also significant. The proposed work also has the benefit of ?fertilizing? the field of oceanography with advances in other sciences (chemistry, materials).

Evans (Queens College - CUNY) and Gary L. Findley (University of Louisiana at Monroe) from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, explores the interactions between solutes in a near critical point supercritical fluid (SCF). The experiments will employ a synchrotron radiation source (e.g., University of Wisconsin Synchrotron Radiation Center) to measure the ionization energies of dopant molecules within the fluid at various electric field strengths and fluid number densities. The results from these studies will yield the minimum energy of the conduction band, which will be compared to predicted values obtained from the local Wigner-Seitz model. Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations will also be used to investigate the energy of a trapped electron in these same near critical point fluids.<br/><br/><br/>The use of supercritical fluids and near critical point fluids as a highly tunable solvent for the synthesis of high purity nanoparticles and pharmaceuticals is an emerging area of technology. This research will advance our understanding of critical point fluids in general and, therefore, will provide insights for those who seek to develop chemical reactions in near critical point SCFs. The research program will engage both graduate and undergraduate students at CUNY and ULM. A Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) activity will be integrated into the synchrotron radiation facility experiments.

An experiment is being designed to search for the neutron electric dipole moment, an observable that violates the reversal of time and plays an important role in descriptions of elementary particle physics and on the observed asymmetry of matter and anti-matter in the universe. Another experiment will measure second order effects in electron-proton scattering to address a present puzzle on the proton structure data. And there are on-going experiments with cold neutrons measuring neutron decay parameters and the strength of the weak interaction among quarks.<br/><br/>The activities will produce new scientists at the Ph.D. level, will give research experience in fundamental physics to undergraduate students, and will contribute to the ascent of a large state university as a premier research institution. The advancement of the careers of women and ethnic minorities is an integral part of this process. Furthermore, the demand for state-of-the-art equipment utilizes the ASU's technical workforce and that of the society at large.

The project will extend current methods for single atom control to a many-body system associated with a large collection of atoms. The fundamental goal is to use light as a quantum bus to connect distant atoms, and thus gain direct control over the quantum state of the combined many-body spin without the need for individual atoms to interact directly. This will be achieved through coherent optical feedback, wherein a light beam is passed through the atom cloud to pick up information about the spin, and then returned in a second pass to transform the spin quantum state accordingly. One important measure of success is the degree to which one can reduce (squeeze) the fundamental quantum uncertainty of the many-body spin. Spin squeezing has direct application in quantum sensing and metrology, and may be a valuable resource for quantum communication and computing. Coherent optical feedback has the potential to produce squeezing that improves exponentially with the product of time and optical density of the atom cloud, and could be a game changer relative to existing schemes that improve only linearly. Experiments will be performed to determine the possible improvement in a real-world situation that includes decoherence, optical losses and imperfections. Numerical simulation suggest that a factor of ten reduction in quantum uncertainty should be feasible in the planned first generation experiment.<br/><br/>The quest for control of complex quantum systems is a grand challenge currently pursued across a broad spectrum of physics disciplines. The effort is motivated by applications that range from the simulation of quantum many-body physics to quantum-limited metrology and quantum information processing, all of which share the goal of harnessing uniquely quantum properties to perform tasks that are not otherwise possible. This project will contribute to the knowledge base of quantum information science, and to the training of future scientists in this highly interdisciplinary field. Students will be involved in all aspects of the project, including education, research, and the dissemination of results. The project will become a cornerstone of the NSF supported Center for Quantum Information and Control, co-located at the University of Arizona College of Optical Science and the University of New Mexico Department of Physics and Astronomy. Weekly video conferencing, an annual research retreat, and joint participation in conferences will enrich the educational experience and strengthen the connections between junior and senior participants at both institutions.

A fundamental question is how different brain systems involved in learning interact to support adaptive decisions. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Daphne Shohamy is addressing this fundamental question. One way in which people gradually learn the relationship between actions and outcomes is by using trial-by-error feedback. This type of learning has traditionally been defined as implicit or habitual, and it is thought to depend on a neural structure called the striatum. A distinct and independent learning system is thought to uniquely support explicit memory for facts and events and to depend on the hippocampus. Emerging data suggest that this dual-system view of memory is over-simplified. This research program explores how different brain systems for learning interact and jointly guide behavior. The project adopts an integrative approach that draws on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in healthy individuals, combined with studies of learning in patients with isolated damage to specific brain systems. Imaging studies provide insight into the spatial and temporal characteristics of brain and cognitive mechanisms. Patient studies augment evidence of the necessity of a system for specific learning processes. By integrating functional imaging and patient research, results from this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of the striatum and the hippocampus in learning, and of how these learning systems interact to guide adaptive behavior.<br/><br/>This research program provides unique opportunities for training and education at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Integrating multiple core tools of cognitive neuroscience (functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students are trained in different approaches to a unified research question. Through this training, they learn to value the principle of converging methods, a theme that is further emphasized in a program of regular joint meetings with students and faculty in laboratories with complementary expertise. Determining the brain and cognitive mechanisms underlying different forms of learning will lay the foundation for potential future interventions to improve education and treat learning deficits, both in healthy individuals and in individuals with brain disorders. To facilitate this translational process, the research program forms the basis of a program of public outreach about the relevance of research on learning and the brain for education and public health. Public lectures and an undergraduate course on cognitive neuroscience in the media focus on broad communication of the relevance of cognitive neuroscience research for many aspects of society, including education, law and medicine.
0960497	Mechanisms of Climate Variability and Change	AGS	CLIMATE & LARGE-SCALE DYNAMICS	07/01/2010	08/05/2013	Dennis Hartmann	WA	University of Washington	Continuing grant	Eric T. DeWeaver	12/31/2016	$1,751,305.00		dhartm@u.washington.edu	4333 Brooklyn Ave NE	Seattle	WA	981950001	2065434043	GEO	5740	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The goal of this research is to understand some basic physical mechanisms which contribute to climate variability and climate change.  Three research topics will be pursued.  The first is the interaction through which the extratropical impact of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is regulated by the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and vice versa.  Preliminary work shows that when the QBO is easterly or ENSO is in its warm state the polar vortex is weak, but when either of these conditions hold, the influence of the other is weak.  The research will be conducted using the NCAR Whole Earth Community Climate Model (WACCM), with modifications to generate and sustain the QBO.  The second topic is the interaction between jet streams and high-frequency transient eddies which plays a dominant role in the natural climate variability of the extratropics.  Earlier work by the Principal Investigator (PI) and a student showed that eddy-jet interactions produce a positive feedback which enhances the persistence of low-frequency annular modes.  The work here seeks to understand how a similar positive feedback operates in the variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation.  The primary tool for the analysis would be ensemble sensitivity analysis, performed using multiple simulations from a barotropic model and later multi-level baroclinic models.  The third topic is the hypothesis that the temperature of tropical anvil clouds remains about the same under global warming (the Fixed Anvil Temperature, or FAT, hypothesis), previously developed by the PI and his students.  The PI's previous work suggested that FAT behavior is related to clear-sky radiative cooling, and the PI suggests that this behavior can explain the similarity of longwave cloud feedbacks in global warming simulations.  One avenue of experimentation would be to modify the water vapor passed to the radiation code of the model independently of the water vapor tracked in the convection scheme and other components of the model.<br/><br/>Three graduate students will be supported under this grant, thus providing for the education of the next generating of scientists.  In addition, research on the above topics will enhance understanding of climate variability and change, and may be beneficial for the development of prediction capabilities for short-term climate variability and long-term climate change.

Understanding atmospheric chemistry of reactive nitrogen species (NOY, where NOY is defined as the sum of NOx and the atmospheric oxidation products of NOx) is critical to pollution prevention and control efforts. While the homogeneous gas phase photochemistry of a large number of NOY has been studied, much less is known about the heterogeneous photochemistry of NOY species such as nitric acid (HNO3) and peroxynitric acid (HO2NO2). The photolysis of adsorbed HNO3 on ground surfaces has been proposed as a major daytime source of HONO in low-NOx environments. Little is known in particular about the UV absorption cross sections and the photolysis quantum yields of HNO3/H2O co-deposited on surface. The project seeks to characterize heterogeneous photolysis of surface-adsorbed HNO3 both in the absence and in the presence of water vapor, of HNO3/H2O co-deposited on surface, and of surface-adsorbed HO2NO2. Wavelength-dependent UV absorption cross sections of surface-adsorbed HNO3, HNO3/H2O, and HO2NO2 will be determined using Brewster-angle cavity ring-down spectroscopy. The photodissociation pathways and product yields from the heterogeneous photolysis of these species will be measured by combining laser photolysis either with Brewster angle cavity ring-down spectroscopy (fused silica surface) or with cavity ring-down spectroscopy (Al or ice film surface). The project will provide information essential to the assessment of the role of heterogeneous photolysis in converting NOx reservoirs into active forms and in producing tropospheric odd hydrogen radicals.<br/><br/>The project will directly lead to the research training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral scholar. In addition to presenting research findings at national and international conferences by the project director, postdoctoral scholar and graduate student, and publishing results in professional journals, the project director, Dr. Lei Zhu, plans to periodically give lectures in the local colleges and universities in the region to share the research results with scientists in the area, excite students' interests in science, and promote intellectual exchanges between different institutions. The Principal Investigator (PI) also plants to increase outreach efforts and to contribute to the goal of diversity and inclusiveness in university education. SUNY-Albany has existing outreach programs such as the Shepherd Project. The Shepherd Project has the goal of establishing long-term partnerships with faculty at historically minority colleges. The PI plans to become an active member in the Shepherd Program at SUNY-Albany.

This research is a first-of-its-kind, proof-of-concept study that uses a novel, new, statistical approach to understand the extent to which the chemistry of rocks, that get subducted, comes back to earth's surface as magmas and gases in volcanic arcs like Japan and the Aleutians. The approach taken combines geoinformatics and data-mining of large compendiums of geochemical and isotopic data for seafloor volcanic rocks and sediments with calculations of potential, common, ocean crust, compositional end members. Data from volcanic arcs in the western and northern Pacific (Marianas through the Aleutians) will be analyzed, and quality-controlled compendiums of data will be compiled for analysis. Broader impacts of the work include support of a PI from groups under-represented in the sciences and undergraduate student training in geoinformatics. The work is relevant to the NSF-funded MARGINS and Ocean Drilling Program missions and science plans. Resulting data will be publicly available through the NSF-funded PetDB data portal and data archive.
0951010	RESUBMISSION Understanding predator-prey signaling interactions: the dynamics of antisnake displays in ground squirrels and kangaroo rats	IOS	ANIMAL BEHAVIOR	07/01/2010	04/08/2013	Rulon Clark	CA	San Diego State University Foundation	Continuing grant	Michelle M. Elekonich	12/31/2015	$390,000.00	Sanjay Joshi	rclark@mail.sdsu.edu	5250 Campanile Drive	San Diego	CA	921822190	6195945731	BIO	7659	9179, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	When confronted with predators, many animals engage in lengthy, conspicuous displays. These antipredator signals are often assumed to be alarm calls that function to warn other individuals about the predator. However, recent research has shown that many of these anti-predator displays may actually be an attempt to communicate with the predator itself. Currently, little is known concerning the function and evolution of communication between two antagonistic parties, like predators and prey. This project will examine several hypotheses about the function of predator-prey communication by focusing on displays given by small mammals when they encounter rattlesnakes. The investigators will use video surveillance equipment and radio telemetry to document natural interactions between rattlesnakes and small mammals in the field. They will also design biorobotic animal models that can recreate key elements of the displays for experimental playbacks. This playback approach will allow researchers to examine how specific behaviors used by small mammals may modify snake foraging behavior, and will provide the first experimental examination of key predictions derived from predator-prey communication theory. This project will provide novel insights into honesty in animal communication, antagonistic coevolution, and the role of receiver sensory systems in shaping signaling behavior. In terms of broader impacts beyond basic biological science, this project will (1) establish collaborations between ecologists and mechanical engineers to develop next-generation robotic technologies for the study of animal behavior; (2) increase participation of underrepresented minorities in research science; (3) develop public outreach through lectures, popular articles, radio, and documentary films; and, (4) provide mentoring for several undergraduate and graduate students.
0948449	Collaborative Research: Australia Down Under: Quantification of Rates and Amount of Continental Subduction During Neogene Arc-continent Collision on Timor	EAR	TECTONICS	06/15/2010	03/22/2011	Nadine McQuarrie	NJ	Princeton University	Continuing grant	David Fountain	11/30/2011	$244,068.00		nmcq@pitt.edu	Off. of Research & Proj. Admin.	Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	GEO	1572	0000	$0.00	The objective of this project is to test whether arc-continent collision events modify overall convergence rates, with the island of Timor as test-case. The mountainous island of Timor exposes a tectono-stratigraphic section of a typical arc-continent collision, with elements from the overriding Asian oceanic/arc plate, a wedge of high pressure/low temperature metamorphic rocks and an underlying deformed Australian continental passive margin sedimentary sequence. An accurate geologic map of the Island, which describes the distribution of rock types and structures, will be produced that will form the basis for balanced structural cross-sections, which, in turn, will be used to quantify how much the sedimentary rocks once deposited on the margin have been telescoped during collision. The magnitude of shortening should correlate with the amount of continental crust that has been subducted. Paleomagnetic analysis is used to determine paleolatitude, rotation, and age of strata. High- to low-temperature thermochronologic data will document the magnitude, variability, and timing of exhumation.<br/><br/>Shortly after the recognition of plate tectonics, the Wilson cycle was introduced in order to describe the creation and demise of ocean basins. The original four stages ? continental rifting, seafloor spreading and formation of ocean basins, closure of ocean basins by subduction of oceanic lithosphere, and continent-continent collision - still form a fundamental basis for our understanding of tectonic processes. Arc-continent collision marks the ultimate demise of an intra-oceanic subduction zone and is a common phenomenon during ocean closure. It is usually assumed that significant underthrusting of continental material under an oceanic island arc is inhibited by buoyancy but the magnitude of continental subduction remains unconstrained. This project will provide an estimate for the magnitude of continental crust that has been subducted, results that would have important implications for mantle chemistry and dynamics. The project involves a significant collaboration with researchers from Norway, Swiss, Australia, and Indonesia as well as training of U.S. and international students.
0961058	Scaling Supreme Court Opinions	SES	METHOD, MEASURE & STATS	06/01/2010	06/02/2010	Thomas Clark	GA	Emory University	Standard Grant	Cheryl L.

Systematic study of the determinants and consequences of judicially-created policy have been hampered by the lack of systematic, quantitative measures of legal doctrine.  The project will develop a theoretical model of the location of cases and opinions in an underlying case space as a function of citations to past cases.  Taking advantage of the common law method used in American jurisprudence, the factual components of cases and the legal components of the various opinions written in the course of disposing of the cases will be systematically estimated.  Original data will be collected on factual and legal links - citations - among cases to which the estimator will be applied.  The method and data will allow scholars to better address the theoretical questions that dominate the literature.  For example, the method will allow for new tests of theories of bargaining on collegial courts, theories of the influence of extra-judicial actors on the creation of legal policy, and theories of the effects of Supreme Court appointments.<br/><br/>The project will have broad implications for the study of democratic political institutions.  First and most directly, the research will shed light onto the systematic patterns in judicial policy making by providing a quantitative measure of judicial policy.  Second, the project will allow future researchers to answer many of the outstanding questions about the constraints under which courts decide cases and the path along which the law develops.  For example, a significant question in political science concerns the extent to which judicial decisions are effective protections for minority rights and the extent to which the courts are constrained by majoritarian politics.  With a systematic measure of the policies created by judicial opinions, better assessments can be made of how judges shape the law and the extent to which lower courts and extra-judicial officials comply with the courts' decisions.

Weill Medical College of Cornell University	Standard Grant	Jodie Jawor	06/30/2016	$299,611.00		hev2006@med.cornell.edu	1300 York Avenue	New York	NY	100654805	6469628290	BIO	7659	1228, 9178, 9179, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	Culture consists of traits transmitted through social learning. One example for social learning is the acquisition of song by songbirds: During a sensitive period early in life, young males learn to imitate their father's song. Songbirds provide tractable models of culture: Members of a species show individual variation in song, and geographically separated groups have local song dialects, i.e., a local song culture. How does song culture develop over multiple generations? In zebra finches, birds kept isolated during the sensitive period develop an abnormal (isolate) song. Interestingly, in an isolated colony founded by an isolate, normal songs with species-typical features emerge within 3-4 generations, due to biased imitation that gradually transforms the isolate song into the species-typical song. Understanding how song develops in individual birds and how song culture develops in a community might require knowledge not only about the vocal, but also about the sensory-perceptual development across generations, as well as the social interactions which accompany it. This project is a combined study of social, vocal, and sensory aspects of song development. The investigators will design controlled social environments to examine dynamically how song is acquired and how song culture emerges. They will combine the continuous analysis of vocal changes and social interactions with non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain to investigate how auditory brain responses to songs develop, and how they drive cultural changes. Moreover, these researchers will test if developmental changes in brain architecture correlate with observed vocal and/or sensory changes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). <br/><br/>This research will provide a bridge between studies of vocal and sensory changes and ethology studies of cultural changes in vocal communication. This project will contribute to the training of three graduate students, and provide scientific education and research training to undergraduate students as well as middle and high school students in the community.
0952218	CAREER: Dynamics of Fluid-Structure-Control Interaction in Rotating Aerodynamic Bodies	CBET	FLUID DYNAMICS, DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS	07/01/2010	06/29/2010	Fernando Ponta	MI	Michigan Technological University	Standard Grant	Ronald Joslin	09/30/2016	$400,000.00		flponta@mtu.edu	1400 Townsend Drive	Houghton	MI	499311295	9064871885	ENG	1443, 7478	060E, 1045, 1187	$0.00	ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Studying the nonlinear dynamics of fluid structure interaction provides insights into a widespread physical topic which makes appearances in many scientific disciplines and several branches of Engineering. These phenomena manifest themselves at a wide range of scales and present excellent opportunities for scientific discovery with a richness of technical application. In cases like a rotor blade or an insect wing, where a body is subject to a complex motion due to the intrinsic operation of a certain mechanism or the dynamics of its control system, the scientific challenge is still greater. <br/><br/>The objective of the research is to provide a better understanding of the underlying physics in slender body aeroelastic dynamics through improved mathematical computational models of the multiphysics process. The program is divided into three overlapping phases each of them building upon previous work the PI has published. The first phase focuses on a new series of adaptive algorithms, based on the hybrid (or vorticity-velocity) formulation of the Navier?Stokes equations. The kinematic Laplacian equation (KLE) technique will be used to create a complete decoupling of the two hybrid variables in a vorticity in time/velocity in space split approach. The resulting global scheme is intrinsically compatible with non-linear adaptive ODE algorithms, providing a way in which the submodels for the different problems involved (flow, structure, control system dynamics, etc.) may be treated individually as modules that interface with the main ODE routine. This allows for the simultaneous analysis of the aeroelastic problem together with any innovative control strategy into a single computationally efficient self adaptive algorithm. The second phase consists of qualitative studies on vortex-shedding and wake dynamics behind oscillating bodies, which play a critical role in the aeroelastic problem. In the third phase, quantitative studies on prototypes of innovative wind turbine blades, and their associated control strategies, will be conducted. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this work is the advancement of computational mathematical models for the com- plex multiphysics problems involving fluid structure control interaction that are present in many engineering designs, providing also a fundamental tool for a better understanding of the underlying physics. The experimental analysis of these coupled multiphysics problems is extremely difficult. In some cases (like wind turbine blades), huge size differences complicate extrapolation of experimental data from the wind tunnel to the prototype scale. In others (like the lifting surfaces used in Micro Air Vehicle applications inspired in the flapping-wing biological mechanisms observed in bird and insect flight), the sheer task of placing sensors on a small scale mechanism in complex rototranslational motion becomes almost insurmountable. If successful, the innovative mathematical models developed here will improve the efficiency and flexibility of the computational implementation and provide a way to tackle these difficulties. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>This work will promote teaching and learning at undergraduate and graduate levels, motivating engineering students to lead research at the frontiers of applied mathematics and computational mechanics. Besides their intrinsic scientific value as computational mathematics tools, the algorithms proposed here have a clear relevance to applications in many disciplines. In particular, the analysis of wind turbine blades constitutes a challenging problem in an emergent technological field of strategic relevance. Current blade technology based on composite laminates is labor intensive, requires a highly qualified workforce, and poses huge challenges in terms of transport logistics and crane capacity. It creates a critical bottleneck that hampers a rapid expansion of wind energy in the US. This work would have transformative effects in the development of wind turbine blade technology through synergistic activities in collaboration with high tech companies located in the region and with Sandia National Labs. Besides contributing to boost the local economy, these activities would help students to gain experience from an industrial research setting. This work intrinsically broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in research: both the PI and one PhD student involved are Hispanic, and the other PhD student is a woman. As part of the educational plan, a set of courses in renewable energies and sustainability will be taught in Spanish. Building upon previous PI's experience, and developed in collaboration with colleagues from the modern languages area, this aims to teach technical Spanish to English speaking engineering students at graduate and undergraduate level, providing a communicational bridge towards the Hispanic community. Expanded nationwide through Michigan Tech's Distance Learning Program, it would contribute to the rapid expansion of the sustainable energy workforce.

These represent two complex problems involving energy transfer in metal structures. In the case of impacted plates, it has been shown that equations developed in the 19th century can be used to describe the steady-state motion of thin plates with some success. However, predicting the transient response of plates to an impact has proven to be a less tractable problem. The work supported here will lend insight into the physics of the struck plate, primarily by comparing experimental work to the results of computational modeling. The interaction between vibrating air and the walls that contain the air is likewise a complex problem of broad interest. Several possible explanations have been posited to account for the audible effects reported in the literature, but as of this date none have been supported by experimental data. The primary goals of this work are to understand the transient response of struck plates within the context of idiophones, and to determine how structural vibrations affect the sound of brass wind instruments. he study of musical instruments is interesting to undergraduate students, and therefore, having a research program in this area naturally attracts young minds. While the systems under study involve musical instruments, the research centers on studying basic physical phenomena which are not unique to musical acoustics. Thus, students are introduced to important scientific research through a subject they find fascinating.
0969172	Analysis and Observations of Particle Size Distribution in Supercell Thunderstorms	AGS	PHYSICAL & DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY	06/15/2010	03/23/2012	Katja Friedrich	CO	University of Colorado at Boulder	Continuing grant	Nicholas F. Anderson	11/30/2014	$363,399.00		katja.friedrich@colorado.edu	3100 Marine Street, Room 481	Boulder	CO	803031058	3034926221	GEO	1525	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Supercell-type thunderstorms, which embody a complex arrangement of long-lasting rotating updrafts and intense downdrafts, are known to be responsible for generating most intense tornadoes. However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding mechanisms culminating in the actual focus and downward extension of stormscale rotation in the form of a damaging tornadic vortex. Some working hypotheses link this process to the strength, thermodynamic stability (temperature) and spatial configuration of downdrafts in the lowest reaches of these storms, which are in-turn dependent on rates of evaporative cooling influenced by the type and size distributions of falling hydrometeors (chiefly rain and hail.) Rigorous attempts have not yet been made to investigate the range of these microphysical precipitation characteristics beneath supercell thunderstorms. The overarching goal of this project is to i) deploy multiple mobile disdrometers (instruments that measure the characteristic sizes and fallspeeds of precipitation particles) beneath supercell thunderstorms during the second Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes EXperiment (VORTEX2; a field program conducted over the central United States known as tornado alley) in Spring 2010, ii) conduct a comprehensive analysis of both existing and newly-obtained disdrometer observations to determine microphysical characteristics in tornadic compared to nontornadic supercell thunderstorms, and iii) relate these results to contemporaneous high-resolution polarimetric Doppler radar observations. Both disdrometers and polarimetric Doppler radar can detect (or in the case of radar, infer) the size distributions of falling hydrometeors. While preliminary analyses have provided some insights about hydrometeor distributions and their impacts on evolution of supercell storm features, a comprehensive analysis of a number of cases using well-placed high-resolution measurements has yet to be conducted and will be achieved in the course of this work.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project will augment our knowledge about microphysical processes within supercell thunderstorms and may lead to improved short-term forecasts and warnings of life-threatening severe weather. Since VORTEX2 hosts the largest number of polarimetric Doppler radars to ever monitor the full lifecycle of supercell thunderstorms, this experiment is an ideal laboratory to address these scientific questions. At present, the lack of skill in forecasting and understanding microphysical processes is largely due to both the inadequate representation of microphysical processes and the lack of measurements. This mobile deployment of disdrometers in VORTEX2 will provide by far the most comprehensive dataset of disdrometer and radar observations and analysis in supercell thunderstorms ever collected. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The improvement of short-term forecasts and warnings of severe weather is strongly linked to the representation and understanding of the microphysical processes, which will be substantially extended by this work. Results will be shared with the modeling community and integrated with other, existing VORTEX2 data sets. Results will also be disseminated through presentations at conferences, seminars, and workshops as well as through publications in relevant professional journals. Additional Broader Impacts will come through direct involvement of graduate students in collection and analysis of field datasets, as well as through enhanced classroom education at both undergraduate and graduate levels.

The project is conducting a series of eight traveling workshops, each held in conjunction with a regional meeting of the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), to disseminate best practices and statistical content knowledge to an audience of instructors who may have limited backgrounds in statistics and limited opportunities for professional development. In addition, the project is conducting a 2-day workshop in conjunction with the 2010 national AMATYC meeting, is offering a distance learning course, and is establishing online discussion groups for instructors of introductory statistics. All of these activities are aimed at 2-year college instructors and are addressing both statistical content and pedagogy following recognized national guidelines. This project is preparing faculty at 2-year colleges to effectively teach introductory statistics by providing access to exemplary resources. The workshops, distance course, and discussion groups are affecting substantial change in the way introductory statistics is taught at 2-year institutions, and are building a stronger community of introductory statistics instructors.

The work specifically addresses the generation of sumesoscale, ageostrophic flows by mesoscale interactions with topography by explicitly resolving the relevant scales of 0.1-10 km in the horizontal. Numerical simulations will be designed to calculate the cascades of energy, enstrophy, and tracer variance and compare with theories, which will also be developed and improved within the scope of the project. The high resolution simulations will be performed in the Kuroshio region where strong topographic features and the the western boundary current dynamics will allow robust testing of the hypotheses. It is hoped that the work will lead to new understandings of the submesoscale regime, the dynamics that connect balance and unbalanced flows, and perhaps even lead to new parameterizations which can be used to represent these processes in ocean and climate models.

This method has a fundamental shortcoming: the optimization does not explicitly target the kinds of distinctions necessary to accomplish the task at hand, such as discriminating (for ASR) between different words that are acoustically confusable or (for MT) between different target-language words that express the multiple meanings of a polysemous source-language word. <br/><br/>Discriminative optimization of the LM, which would overcome this shortcoming, requires large quantities of paired input-output sequences: speech and its reference transcription for ASR or source-language (e.g. Chinese) sentences and their translations into the target language (say, English) for MT. Such resources are expensive, and limit the efficacy of discriminative training methods. <br/><br/>In a radical departure from convention, this project is investigating discriminative training using easily available, *unpaired* input and output sequences: un-transcribed speech or monolingual source-language text and unpaired target-language text. Two key ideas are being pursued: (i) unlabeled input sequences (e.g. speech or Chinese text) are processed to learn likely confusions encountered by the ASR or MT system; (ii) unpaired output sequences (English text) are leveraged to discriminate between these well-formed sentences from the (supposed) ill-formed sentences the system could potentially confuse them with. <br/><br/>This self-supervised discriminative training, if successful, will advance machine intelligence in fundamental ways that impact many other applications.

There is a possibility that the teeth and bones of a small marsupial could also be found. Previous studies have demonstrated that these horizons contain unique fossil assemblages that provide information used to reconstruct paleoenvironments and paleoclimate. The fossils represent organisms previously not found in Antarctica and consequently their study will lead to the development of new hypotheses concerning southern hemisphere biogeography. The new discoveries will also increase knowledge of paleoenvironments and paleoclimates as well as biogeographic relationships of the biota of the southern hemisphere. For some organisms, such as Nothofagus (Southern Beech) or the trechine groundbeetle, fossils would confirm that Antarctica was inhabited as part of Gondwana. For other fossils, such as the cyclorrhaphan fly or freshwater mollusks not expected to have inhabited Antarctica, the discoveries will require a reassessment of phylogenetic interpretations and a reinvestigation of the role of Antarctica in the evolutionary history of those organisms. The new fossil-based knowledge will require integration with interpretations from cladistics and molecular genetics to develop more comprehensive phylogenetic hypotheses for a range of organisms.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>The discovery of fossils in Antarctica and implications for climate change has proven to be popular with the media. This attention will help disseminate the results of this study. Before the field season, the PI will work with local media and with area schools to set up field interviews and web casts from Antarctica. The project will also involve the training of a graduate student in the field and in the follow up studies of the fossils in the laboratory.

Testing a global hypothesis using the Australian fossil mammal record - Christine Janis, Brown University and John Damuth, University of California, Santa Barbara<br/><br/>Is there evidence for a previously unrecognized worldwide change in terrestrial ecosystems approximately 12 million years ago? The PIs hypothesize that a striking pattern that they observed first in the history of the mammal faunas of North America may be one that is actually observable throughout the globe. This project will test this hypothesis by determining whether the same pattern occurred contemporaneously in the fossil record of Australia. Previous research showed that before 12-10 million years ago in North America, many ecological communities contained exceptionally high numbers of species of browsing ungulates (large leaf-eating herbivores) ? up to three times the numbers seen in vegetationally comparable modern-day habitats. In fact, the numbers of browser species in some places exceeded even those for modern tropical rainforests ? the present-day habitats with the highest biodiversity of browsers. No other members of these mammal faunas showed any elevated or unusual biodiversity, and faunas younger than 12-10 million years show only normal numbers of browser species (by today's standards). Why the older habitats were sometimes able to support what today would be impossibly high numbers of browsers is currently unknown. However, evidence suggests that some European and African faunas from before 12 million years ago also showed too many browsers, which in turn suggests a global cause. This project will answer the question of whether there were also too many browsers in the well-documented mammalian fossil record of Australia, and, if so, whether this phenomenon disappeared at about the same time as it did in North America. Study of museum collections from Australian localities will allow determination of the numbers of browser species at different times, based on morphology and wear of the teeth. Australia's distinct fauna and environmental history will provide a robust test of whether too many browsers was a global occurrence. If it wasn't, then we must look for regional or local causes; but if the global hypothesis is supported then a worldwide phenomenon becomes more likely and these results will guide and motivate the subsequent search for a global cause. The project's results will have implications not only for global environmental history and climate change, but also for any methods that attempt paleoecological interpretations for faunas older than 10 million years that use modern mammal faunas as an environmental proxy. This project will be a new international collaboration and will involve students and postdoctoral researchers.

This has lead to an increased use of non- and semiparametric estimation and testing methods in economics since these in general impose weaker functional restrictions on the models of interest.<br/><br/>Many popular non- and semiparametric estimators involve so-called kernel-smoothing. However, these can be challenging to implement since they involve choosing appropriate bandwidths which are an integral part of the estimators: The resulting estimators are in general sensitive to the bandwidth choice. Unfortunately, theory offers few guidelines for how these should be chosen in finite samples: First of all, the bandwidth does not appear in the asymptotic distribution of the parametric estimator. Secondly, for the first-step estimation error to vanish at an optimal rate, undersmoothing is required. This rules out standard bandwidth selection methods such as plug-in and cross-validation. For a few special estimators, methods have been developed, but these can be complicated to implement and do not always perform well.<br/><br/>We here propose a novel class of semiparametric profile estimators that do not suffer from these problems: We develop a modified version of the standard objective (likelihood) function defining the estimator. The modification entails that it can be used to estimate both the nonparametric component and the parametric one. The advantages of this modification are three-fold: First, the modification ensures that an error term normally appearing in the expansion of the parametric estimator now vanishes. Thus we expect that the modified version will have better finite-sample properties. Second, by removing the error term, we do not have to undersmooth in order for the first-step estimation error to vanish at an optimal rate. Hence standard bandwidth selection methods can be used. Finally, the proposed modified estimator is no more difficult to implement than standard estimators and require no heavy computations.<br/><br/>We also demonstrate how the modified objective function can be used to improve on existing non- and semiparametric testing procedures using kernel-smoothing methods. The modified tests are shown to dominate the original ones in terms of Pitman's relative efficiency criterion and as such are more powerful. As with the kernel-based semiparametric estimation procedures, the issue of how to select bandwidths in the implementation of kernel-based testing procedures is to a large extent unresolved. We will examine the issue of bandwidth selection for the new class of test statistics developed in this project.<br/><br/>The novel procedures can be used to improve upon existing econometric methods developed for many semiparametric models, including partially linear models, single-index models, (semi-)varying-coefficient models, and models with time-varying parameters. These and many other models will be considered in the project.

The concerted application of comprehensive, two-dimensional gas chromatography, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, and pyrosequencing-based metagenomics will provide unparalleled insight into petroleum biodegradation and the responsible microbes, and distinguishes this work from any previous studies. The primary hypotheses to be tested are the following: 1) Hydrocarbon biodegradation by microbes acts simultaneously on thousands of distinct compounds, not in a strictly stepwise fashion. 2) Hydrocarbon preference pattern and associated genomic potential for a<br/>microbial community are controlled primarily by the redox potential of the terminal electron-accepting process. 3) High-molecular-weight and polar compounds are bio-transformed through incomplete oxidation and structural alteration, not through complete remineralization. These hypotheses will be tested by conducting time-series laboratory experiments in which petroleum is biodegraded with different electron acceptors and at different temperatures. The loss and gain patterns for molecules within each treatment and differences across treatments in these patterns and in genomic content will provide the data to test these hypotheses. Results are further anticipated to reveal novel metabolic actions and genomic capacity, and yield molecular degradation patterns that can relate environmental genomic and petroleum content to the relevant biological processes. New data analysis tools will also be developed and validated.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Results from this research will contribute broadly to an understanding of petroleum biodegradation and carbon cycling in the Earth system, and will be broadly disseminated through popular outlets with assistance from a professional artist. Knowledge gained from this research will also be translated directly to federal agencies including the NOAA?s Assessment and Restoration Division, as well as to private industry through existing corporate ties. Direct educational impacts of this research include the training and education of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as the advanced training of postdoctoral researchers. High school students will be incorporated through existing summer research programs targeting students from underserved regions. Undergraduate students will be incorporated into all aspects of the proposed research through integration into coursework and REU support. Mentoring of a graduate student and postdoctoral researchers will be provided by the PIs.

Gore (University of Arizona/USDA-ARS) and Jianbing Yan (CIMMYT, Mexico)<br/><br/>Senior Personnel: Dick Johnson (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and Theresa M. Fulton (Cornell University)<br/><br/>Carotenoids are a group of several hundred distinct chemical compounds that are essential for vision and immune system function and as natural colorants in fresh and processed foods. Some carotenoids (betacarotene, alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin) are the major provitamin A compounds in the human diet while others such as lutein and lycopene play a role in decreasing the incidence and severity of macular degeneration or prostate cancer, respectively. The goal of this project is to identify the genes and their most useful variants (alleles) in maize that determine the levels and compositions of carotenoids and vitamin E in maize seed. Using information obtained using the model plant Arabidopsis, maize genes corresponding to those responsible for the biosynthesis of carotenoids and vitamin E will be identified. Knowledge of the natural variation in the content and composition of these compounds in maize seed will be combined with the recently published genome sequence of maize and detailed analysis of gene expression during maize seed development to determine which specific alleles of these genes contribute the most to beneficial levels of these compounds in maize seed. The alleles identified can then be used in maize breeding programs to increase the levels of these compounds to enhance the quality of food and feed derived from maize. This same approach will also enable the identification of new and novel genes that play significant roles in determining the levels of carotenoids and vitamin E in maize. The combined information obtained will provide a road map for generating similar changes for these and other vitamins in other agricultural crops that serve as major food and feed sources for humanity. <br/><br/>Understanding the molecular genetic basis of biochemical traits in agricultural seed crops that are essential for nutrition in humans and animals is a key component of meeting future global food and feed needs. The research will provide a comprehensive genetic assessment of natural variation in two such biochemical pathways and will serve as a model for genome scale integrative analysis of other areas of plant metabolism in maize and other agricultural plant species. The large body of publically available gene expression data generated in this study will provide an unparalleled resource that will greatly impact the maize research community. The research will provide a unique environment for educating the next generation of scientists through engagement of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as postdoctoral associates in research at interfaces of plant genetics, genomics, quantitative genetics and plant biochemistry. The researchers will engage under-represented groups in plant scientific research through targeted recruitment of Hispanic undergraduates to the research programs at all three universities. This outreach will include educating preschool children, K-12 students, and undergraduates in the concepts of genetics, plant breeding, biochemistry, nutrition, food sources and their relevance to diet and health. As vitamin deficiencies are a pervasive global health issue, a practical outcome of this research will be to provide the basis for more expedient and cost effective marker-assisted selection programs in maize for enhanced dietary levels of carotenoids and vitamin E in the US and developing countries. Toward this end, the project have established a network with researchers at CIMMYT (Mexico) and IITA (Nigeria) to facilitate seamless transfer of relevant results into active international breeding programs targeting developing countries.

Elekonich	10/31/2010	$330,000.00		sahelekar@tmhs.org	ONE BAYLOR PLAZA	HOUSTON	TX	770303411	7137981297	BIO	7659	1228, 9178, 9179, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	Culture consists of traits transmitted through social learning. One example for social learning is the acquisition of song by songbirds: During a sensitive period early in life, young males learn to imitate their father's song. Songbirds provide tractable models of culture: Members of a species show individual variation in song, and geographically separated groups have local song dialects, i.e., a local song culture. How does song culture develop over multiple generations? In zebra finches, birds kept isolated during the sensitive period develop an abnormal (isolate) song. Interestingly, in an isolated colony founded by an isolate, normal songs with species-typical features emerge within 3-4 generations, due to biased imitation that gradually transforms the isolate song into the species-typical song. Understanding how song develops in individual birds and how song culture develops in a community might require knowledge not only about the vocal, but also about the sensory-perceptual development across generations, as well as the social interactions which accompany it. This project is a combined study of social, vocal, and sensory aspects of song development. The investigators will design controlled social environments to examine dynamically how song is acquired and how song culture emerges. They will combine the continuous analysis of vocal changes and social interactions with non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain to investigate how auditory brain responses to songs develop, and how they drive cultural changes. Moreover, these researchers will test if developmental changes in brain architecture correlate with observed vocal and/or sensory changes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). <br/><br/>This research will provide a bridge between studies of vocal and sensory changes and ethology studies of cultural changes in vocal communication. This project will contribute to the training of three graduate students, and provide scientific education and research training to undergraduate students as well as middle and high school students in the community.
0967407	Collaborative Research: Integrated investigation of inertial particle pair dynamics in turbulence	CBET	PARTICULATE &MULTIPHASE PROCES	07/15/2010	01/22/2014	Hui Meng	NY	SUNY at Buffalo	Standard Grant	Dimitrios Papavassiliou	06/30/2015	$213,685.00		huimeng@buffalo.edu	520 Lee Entrance	Amherst	NY	142282567	7166452634	ENG	1415	055E, 058E, 9251	$0.00	We propose an integrated experimental and numerical investigation of the dynamics of inertial particles in isotropic turbulence. The experimental work will be performed in a new soccer ball turbulence facility that will be built as part of the project. The new facility will be capable of producing isotropic turbulence with a Reynolds number (based on the Taylor microscale) of 500. Into this flow, we will introduce metal coated hollow glass spheres and image those spheres using an advanced version of digital holographic particle image velocimetry (DHPIV). Using a unique optical setup, we will image the particles in single and double exposure modes to obtain position and velocity statistics. Additionally, we will perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) that will be used to: (i) advance the DHPIV technique; and (ii) complement the experimental measurements.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The measurements we propose to make in the lab and in silico will allow us to quantify two important aerosol processes: (i) two-particle dispersion of inertial particles; and (ii) inertial particle collision rates, both for the first time. DHPIV will capture position and relative velocity statistics, and through kinematic relationships these data will be used to quantify the dispersion rate and the collision kernel as a function of the particle parameters (Stokes numbers) and Reynolds number. The new facility, combined with a judicious choice of particles, will allow us to isolate the effects of each parameter. A crucial aspect of the velocity measurement is the accurate pairing of particles in the two images. Current algorithms do not work well for inertial particles that don't necessarily follow the flow or remain highly correlated. With the aid of DNS, we will develop a new matching algorithm based on sweeping the time lapse between images. The DNS too will be advanced under this study. Our current algorithm is capable of performing 10243 simulations on our 32-node cluster. However, in order to match the conditions of the proposed experiments, we must increase the resolution. We will modify the data structure of our code so as to take advantage of recent developments in the 3D fast Fourier transform. The new code will be able to run on 100's and even 1000's of processors on the Texas Advanced Computing Center, enabling 20483 simulations and Reynolds numbers of 500. In this way, we will continue our tradition of making quantitative comparisons with the experiments. Additionally, DNS yields more information than the experiments about the flow field, as well as allows us to study Lagrangian statistics. We will perform these studies to test assumptions we have made in the analysis of the experiments, as well as to advance our theoretical understanding of particle dispersion and collision.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>The motion of discrete particles in a turbulent fluid is of great significance to a broad range of engineering flows as well as natural flows. From understanding the competition between growth and oxidation of soot particles in a diesel engine, to quantifying the impact these particles have on the global climate, we are challenged to describe the dispersive and collisional properties of particles in order to get these predictions right. Historically our understanding of turbulence has gone hand-in-hand with our ability to measure the key variables, either experimentally or computationally. The goal of this proposal is to measure the statistical quantities that will allow us to quantify these two important aerosol processes. These results will stimulate an exciting new theoretical understanding, both within our group and elsewhere. Our approach is unconventional in that we intermingle DNS and experiment completely. Indeed, a strength of this work has been our ability to make quantitative comparisons between DNS and experiments. We meet weekly via videoconference to thoroughly discuss all aspects of the work. This provides a rich environment for students, who are exposed, at a high level, to all of the activities. The PIs have been heavily involved with outreach throughout their careers. Recent activities include recruitment and mentoring of women and underrepresented minorities at their respective institutions, outreach within the community, and organization of a series of high profile workshops at the NSF directed towards encouraging underrepresented minorities into the academy.

Professor Stanko Brankovic and his research group at the University of Houston will investigate the governing thermodynamics and kinetics processes controlling the morphology of the metal nanodeposit obtained via surface limited galvanic displacement reaction. In this novel deposition method, a single monolayer of less noble metal is oxidized-displaced by more noble metal cations which are simultaneously reduced-deposited on a substrate surface. The obtained metallic deposit has just a single atom in thickness as nanoclusters uniformly distributed over the substrate surface. Such nanodeposit will be used as model system to study structure-property relation of catalyst monolayers, their stability in different chemical reactions and their self-organization. In addition, a nanoscale three dimensional metallic structures produced by this method or by dealloying will be evaluated as a potential path for the fabrication of more complex nanostructures, including those that can be used for ultrasound sensing application.<br/><br/>The fundamental concepts that will be developed in this work will have an impact in many other scientific and technological disciplines. Perhaps the most immediate one is the application to microelectronics fabrication, where precise, uniform deposition (i.e., conformal deposition) on complex substrates remains a daunting challenge. Self-organized 2D metallic architectures, design of active catalyst monolayers or organized growth of carbon nanotubes are some other examples. This program integrates an educational component which spans over the range from high school to graduate students, and addresses the development of cutting edge research in the physical sciences, with an over-reaching theme of long term sustainable technology development. The long term goal of this program is to produce the highly qualified scientist and engineers able to carry out the technical challenges of the modern world.

Recent studies have revealed that IDPs are highly abundant in nature and carry out a number of crucial biological functions that are complementary to the functions of structured (ordered) proteins. In any given organism, IDPs constitute a functionally broad and densely populated subset of its proteome. IDPs are common across the three domains of life, being especially abundant in the eukaryotic proteomes. Signaling sequences and sites of posttranslational modifications are commonly located within regions of intrinsic disorder. Disorder-to-order transitions in an IDP are coupled with the adoption of different structures in complexes with different partners. The disorder-based signaling is modulated by various posttranslational modifications and alternative splicing. GRC provides a forum for the discussion of IDPs, with topics including but not limited to experimental and theoretical studies of their intrinsically flexible state, mechanisms of their interactions and their functional roles in biological systems. This GRC will unite participants from all scientific disciplines with an interest in broadening our understanding of IDPs and engaging in biophysical studies of individual proteins as well as genomic and proteomic studies in whole organisms.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>This conference seeks to gather leading and established specialists in the field and to bring them into contact with each other and with younger scientists, in an effort to seed new thoughts across the field. Consistent with the GRC philosophy, a retreat-like atmosphere will be designed. This will help in summarizing current knowledge and in spreading the ideas across the community. There are no formal publications of the conference proceedings, only collegial exchanges on site and afterward. This new GRC will help promote research of IDPs at different levels and in various fields, including but not limited to bioinformatics, proteomics, interactomics, and unfoldomics and then will help to link the results of these diverse studies with the thorough and detailed characterization of IDPs. In the preliminary program, ten of thirty one speakers and discussion leaders are women. The program has a balanced mixture of established and young scientists. When the attendees are selected from the pool of applicants, principles of affirmative action with respect to minority groups, women and junior scientists will be used as criteria, in addition to the date of application and the scientific background of the applicant.

0944659	Collaborative Research: Ecophysiology of DMSP and related compounds and their contributions to carbon and sulfur dynamics in Phaeocystis antarctica	PLR	ANTARCTIC ORGANISMS & ECOSYST	06/01/2010	07/02/2012	Ronald Kiene	AL	University of South Alabama	Continuing grant	Christian Fritsen	05/31/2015	$240,237.00		Rkiene@disl.org	307 University Boulevard	Mobile	AL	366880002	2514606333	GEO	5111	7969, EGCH	$0.00	Abstract<br/><br/>Spectacular blooms of Phaeocystis antarctica in the Ross Sea, Antarctica are the source of some of the world's highest concentrations of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and its volatile degradation product, dimethylsulfide (DMS). The flux of DMS from the oceans to the atmosphere in this region and its subsequent gas phase oxidation generates aerosols that have a strong influence on cloud properties and possibly climate. In the oceans, DMS and DMSP are quantitatively significant components of the carbon, sulfur, and energy flows in marine food webs, especially in the Ross Sea. Despite its central role in carbon and sulfur biogeochemistry in the Ross Sea, surprisingly little is known about the physiological functions of DMSP in P. Antarctica. The research will isolate and characterize DMSP lyases from P. antarctica, with the goal of obtaining amino acid and gene sequence information on these important enzymes. The physiological studies will focus on the effects of varying intensities of photosynthetically active radiation, with and without ultraviolet radiation as these are factors that we have found to be important controls on DMSP and DMS dynamics. The research also will examine the effects of prolonged darkness on the dynamics of DMSP and related compounds in P. antarctica, as survival of this species during the dark Antarctic winter and at sub-euphotic depths appears to be an important part of the Phaeocystis? ecology. A unique aspect of this work is the focus on measurements of intracellular MSA, which if detected, would provide strong evidence for in vivo radical scavenging functions for methyl sulfur compounds. The study will advance understanding of what controls DMSP cycling and ultimately DMS emissions from the Ross Sea and also provide information on what makes P. antarctica so successful in this extreme environment. The research will directly benefit and build on several interrelated ocean-atmosphere programs including the International Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) program. The PIs will participate in several activities involving K-12 education, High School teacher training, public education and podcasting through the auspices of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab Discovery Hall program and SUNY ESF. Two graduate students will be employed full time, and six undergraduates (2 each summer) will be trained as part of this project.

This motion is accommodated by a complicated and incompletely understood belt of deformation along the western margin of the Great Basin that links major, misaligned strike-slip faults in eastern California and western Nevada. Based on previous research and our preliminary work, we have identified that the deformed belt underlies a region of nearly 15,000 km2 and contains large tectonic blocks that both translate toward the northwest as the crust is pulled apart and also undergo vertical-axis rotations of 20∞ to 90∞. In this project, we will provide a better understanding of the dimensions of the tectonic blocks, how far they have moved laterally, to what degree they experienced vertical-axis rotation, and the spatial-temporal pattern of deformation. Much of the western borderland of North America and many parts of other continents around the world reside in similar tectonic settings and record comparable histories of deformation. This study will provide the opportunity to better understand how and to what degree the translation and rotation of large crustal blocks is accommodated as the continental crust is fragmented in response to the relative movement of lithospheric plates.<br/><br/><br/>Crustal response to displacement transfer in structural stepovers linking misaligned segments of large-magnitude transcurrent faults is accommodated by components of translational and rotational displacement and strain and results in complex three-dimensional arrays of structures. The mechanisms by which rotational and translational strain are accommodated either by rigid-blocks and/or by distributed strain and to what degree the translational and rotational processes are coupled in space-time are poorly understood. In this study, we integrate detailed and regional geologic mapping with thermochronologic, structural, and paleomagnetic analysis to unravel the history of transcurrent structures separating the Sierra Nevada and central Great Basin. The objective of the work is to characterize transcurrent and high-angle normal fault displacement, estimate slip on low-angle detachment faults, and assess the relation between translational deformation and differential rotation. Our research results will provide the needed detailed understanding of the spatial and temporal pattern of deformation and supply the constraints to differentiate between coeval and serial translational and rotational deformation histories within the stepover system and provide the means to assess whether or to what degree rotation is accommodated by rigid-body motion or distributed strain processes.

NSF Funds will be used to help partially defray registration costs for undergraduates, graduate students postdocs and faculty participants. The MTSM Conference will be a venue where the latest research in computational, theoretical and experimental thermodynamics and statistical mechanics is shared. The meeting draws participants from a huge section of the United States, and attendees range from established senior faculty members to undergraduates and new graduate students. Sharing research results and interacting on a deep personal level with other researchers is necessary to advance science and engineering, especially now that electronic communication has made many interactions with colleagues shallow and fleeting. Short, intense and focused meetings are especially useful for younger researchers, who can use these meetings to establish contacts and build collaborations with other researchers. The MTSM Conference has successfully helped build research collaborations among several groups in the Midwest region over the years, and it is anticipated that the 2010 edition will continue this tradition.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>For twenty years, the Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics Conference has been successful in facilitating meaningful field specific discussions and longstanding collaborations among researchers in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Part of the historical success of the meeting is the annual attempt to keep costs at a minimum by holding bare bones meetings at universities throughout the Midwest region. This proposal, combined with funds committed by Notre Dames College of Engineering and Graduate School, will provide funding to help defray meeting expenses and maximize participation. The opportunity to attend the MTSM meeting is especially important for early career scientists (undergraduates, graduate students, and newer faculty members) who will be able to participate in a focused meeting as a way to stimulate creativity and develop sustained collaborative relationships with colleagues working on related projects. In contrast to big national meetings or high profile meetings like Gordon Research Conferences, the 2010 MTSM meeting will be tailored to enable these kinds of personal and mentoring interactions. Four younger faculty members will give invited talks to their peers, 45 graduate students will be able to participate, with roughly 29 contributed talks, and a new feature will enable 15 undergraduate researchers to participate in a poster session and preview talk session where they will be given 5 minutes to highlight their work. Finally, up to 16 additional faculty members will attend, most serving as audience participants and mentors for the students in their group and others. These faculty members will represent a diverse set of colleges and universities, including some primarily undergraduate institutions, and a range of experience levels. This diversity is intentional. It provides an important forum for widening the research conversation in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics by including researchers from the point when their scientific interests are just beginning to the point where they can reflect back on a full career. NSF support for MTSM will enable students who might not have the means to attend such a conference to participate. A special workshop on applying to graduate school and how to apply for fellowships will also be offered to the undergraduate researchers.

The body is well-known to geologists because it holds the world's largest reserves of platinum and related elements and is a major source of chromium and vanadium. The Bushveld is also notable for its size, which has been estimated to be up to 600,000 cubic kilometers, and for the fact that its structure reflects a long and complex solidification history. Despite its enormity, geochemical characteristics of the rocks indicate that some amount of the original magma had escaped from the chamber and is thus missing from the present body. This raises the questions of what was the nature of this additional magma and where could it have gone. These questions need to be answered if geologists are ever to understand how and under what the conditions the Bushveld Complex solidified. Research to date by the team has led them to hypothesize that the missing magma is now represented by a sequence of lavas known as the Rooiberg Group (plus their intrusive equivalents, the Rashoop granophyres), the ages of which are identical to the Bushveld age within uncertainty estimates. The present research is directed at testing this hypothesis. As part of the project, Mathez and colleagues will also organize a week-long workshop for 20-25 South African earth science teachers on the mineral resources of South Africa. The workshop will be taught by Mathez, VanTongeren, and two African-American New York City school teachers, who will thus gain knowledge of both mineral deposits and unique experience in teaching across cultural divides.<br/><br/>More specifically, the research seeks to test the hypothesis that the Rooiberg lavas and associated rocks originated from the Bushveld Upper Zone. This will be accomplished by a detailed study of the trace element geochemistry of the Upper Zone to determine the compositions of the liquids in equilibrium with the cumulate minerals. The derived liquid compositions will then be compared with Rooiberg and Rashoop rock compositions. The top members of the Rooiberg Group are dominated by rhyolite, whereas the Bushveld Upper Zone, which is the most chemically evolved part of the intrusion, is dominated by cumulate rocks consisting of assemblages with most or all of the minerals plagioclase, Ca-poor pyroxene, Ca-rich pyroxene, magnetite, ilmenite, Fe-rich olivine, and apatite. Therefore, the possibility that a rhyolite could be in equilibrium with these phases bears on one of the most fundamental and debated questions in igneous petrology, namely whether mafic magmas differentiate toward Fe-rich or Si-rich compositions. In addition, if the Rooiberg and Rashoop rocks indeed originated from the Bushveld magma chamber, this implies that the Bushveld intruded into a much shallower level of the crust than has been generally appreciated, thus helping to define the geodynamic setting of the intrusion.

Road construction advocates argue that new roads facilitate market access, promote economic development, and improve health and well-being. Detractors contend that new roads have many negative ecological and social consequences. To help resolve this debate, the researchers will use a natural experiment created by the imminent construction of a road through a national park inhabited by three different native Amazonian groups in Bolivia.<br/><br/>The project will take place over a period of three years in villages inhabited by Tsimanee, YuracarÈ, and MoxeÒos peoples, in Parque Nacional Isiboro-SÈcure. The study will commence in 2010 before the road is built, with the collection of baseline social and ecological data. In 2011 and 2012, after construction has been completed, annual follow-up surveys will be carried out to determine the road's immediate impacts. Measures of well-being will include measures of (a) village income and status inequality, (b) intra-household income disparities, (c) individual cash income, (d) social capital, and (e) psychological adjustment. Measures of natural resource use will include changes in the extraction of natural resources for sale and for consumption. <br/><br/>To leverage the research opportunity afforded by this natural experiment, the researchers will invite other researchers to request that additional data be collected on particular topics of interest for other research questions. Thus while this project focuses on immediate and short-term effects of road building, it also will create a significant data repository for other researchers to assess medium and long-term effects. In addition, the research program supports the training of three doctoral students. <br/><br/>The construction of roads through native Amazonian territories has polarized defenders and critics of road building in particular, and development more generally, into two camps. A single study on such a complex topic cannot resolve the debate, but by providing before-and-after data, this project will provide an empirical basis for an eventual resolution.

The researcher will focus specifically on comparing the effects of imitation (behavior copying) with emulation (copying of products of behavior). Using an experimental micro-society design, which is a laboratory method for simulating cultural generations, the research will (1) improve understanding of how different social learning mechanisms contribute to the evolution of cumulative culture; (2) develop new methods for studying cumulative culture; and (3) contribute to better understanding of human cognitive evolution.<br/><br/>The researcher will collect data by videotaping social information transfer in a laboratory setting. Subjects will be asked to construct a weight-supporting device using simple materials and their success will be evaluated by measuring the maximum weight that each constructed device is capable of supporting. The subjects will be videotaped as they work and the tapes subjected to a close analysis to determine the amount and success of information transfer under different social learning conditions. The researcher will focus on (1) the interactions between the type of learning used and the rate of accumulation of changes to culture, (2) the effects of different social learning mechanisms on the fidelity of information transmission, and (3) the efficacy of behavioral information transmission by emulation in the absence of direct access to the behavior itself (that is, by looking solely at successful device examples without being able to observe the behaviors that produced them). <br/><br/>This research is important because it will help social scientists to better understand the cognitive changes that were necessary in human evolution for people to develop and pass on complex cultural practices. It also will contribute to understanding how cultural information is transferred between individuals, which is of interest to those concerned with cultural variation and processes of change. Funding this research also supports the education of a social scientist.

The genesis of combinatorial group theory at the end of the nineteenth century was intimately involved with geometric questions, but subsequent developments tended towards algebra and logic. In the 1980's Cannon, Gromov, Thurston and others produced an infusion of geometric ideas which shed a great deal of light on earlier results and led to new research methods known collectively as geometric group theory. The main themes of geometric group theory involve the large scale geometry of cell complexes, asymptotic properties of groups, and connections with theoretical computer science. More recently results on asymptotic properties of groups have been particularly useful in the cryptanalysis of group based cryptosystems which occur in postquantum cryptography as possible alternatives to current public key systems. <br/><br/> Over the past several years dramatic achievements in these areas have led to progress on a number of basic and difficult questions and also to novel connections with other areas of mathematics and with theoretical computer science. We will bring people from various branches of mathematics and computer science together to consider new approaches to open questions in the field. Our major goal is to strengthen the connections group theory has with other branches of mathematics and to highlight new promising perspectives. A cornerstone of activities of the thematic semester will be a collection of workshops covering related themes. These workshops will be organized to benefit students, postdocs, and young researchers.

Lutz	05/31/2014	$303,156.00		jacksonm@stanford.edu	3160 Porter Drive	Palo Alto	CA	943041212	6507232300	SBE	1320	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Social networks affect many economic outcomes ranging from which jobs people find to which products they buy. A prominent aspect of network structure is homophily: the tendency of interactions between individuals to be biased towards others who have similar characteristics. Substantial homophily can lead to the fragmentation of societies and communities and thus can significantly affect who interacts with whom, what people learn and what they believe, and how people behave. This project, continuing studies from an earlier grant, includes investigations as to how homophily and other social network properties influence behaviors such as informal borrowing and lending among individuals, word-of-mouth communication, and participation in microfinance programs in the developing world.<br/><br/>The first part of this research concerns how homophily in social networks affects word-of-mouth learning and diffusion. The focus of the research is on how the specifics of the learning process affects the extent to which homophily can retard learning and diffusion. An important question would be whether or not adjustments made by individuals in a society in the way that they process information can help correct for biases that the structure of a social network might introduce. Interestingly, preliminary investigations show that societies in which individuals follow simple rules of thumb for how they process and relay information to and from friends can learn more and learn faster on an aggregate level than societies where individuals are more sophisticated and ``rational?? in their information processing on an individual level. <br/><br/>The second part of this research concerns the relative roles of choice and chance in social network formation and in producing homophily patterns. Do high school students choose to form a disproportionate share of their friendships with others of their own race, or does institutional structure (e.g., assignment of students to classes, participation in various clubs, etc.) lead students to meet others of their own race in disproportionately high numbers? Data analysis based on a model developed under the previous grant suggests that both biases are present and significant; and that the relative roles of choice and chance differ significantly across races. For example, Asians, Blacks, and Hispanics face three to six times higher biases in the rates at which they meet their own types than Whites. This part of the project would involve tracing the sources of these differences across races, and developing a general statistical model of network formation for identifying the roles of choice and chance in combination with other factors in a wider variety of settings. <br/><br/>The third part of the research involves analyzing network data from 75 villages in rural India together with participation by residents of those villages in a recent microfinance loan program. This rich data set includes social networks of eleven different varieties including friendship networks, borrowing networks, advice networks, business networks, and family ties; as well as information about which residents have taken out microfinance loans and what their repayment rates are over time. The network properties influencing microfinance participation will be investigated, including things like caste and subcaste homophily. The data should also provide novel insight into structural contrasts across different sorts of networks. The research will include continued development of and testing of a new theory that suggests how borrowing and favor networks should differ from other social networks. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include the interdisciplinary importance of new tools for analyzing and understanding social networks. The project will also shed new light on policies designed to encourage desegregation and economic development.

The flow of water masses between the Bering Sea and the Arctic and Pacific oceans, changes in Arctic ice volume, and whether dense intermediate waters formed in the Pacific during this time will be investigated as some of the possible triggers of past climate change. The high resolution sediment records obtained from this cruise, with relatively large-amplitude signals, provide a unique opportunity to understand how insulation changes in the upper atmosphere propagate through the climate system and to further test if the orbital cycles of climate change primarily operate on 23ky versus 40 ky timescales. This study utilizes K % logging data from the cruise with paleomagnetic, sedimentological (eg., grain size analysis) and paleontological (eg., analysis of microfossil assemblages; d18O and d13C measurements of benthic and planktonic forams) measurements from the drill cores. The information expected from this study is critical for understanding the fundamental drivers and feedbacks between ice sheets, oceanic and atmospheric circulation and the global carbon cycle. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project significantly advances large investments previously made in an important IODP expedition. The data derived from this investigation can provide important information for paleoclimate/ocean models, and is relevant towards projections of future climate under IPCC AR4 scenarios. The project includes a team of early and mid-career scientists, and includes international collaborations with other scientists of the IODP community. Support is also provided for undergraduate and graduate education, and for public outreach and education.
0970048	Relativistic Heavy Ion Collision Studies at the LHC and RHIC	PHY	NUCLEAR STRUCTURE & REACTIONS	07/01/2010	04/30/2012	Thomas Humanic	OH	Ohio State University	Continuing grant	Kenneth Hicks	06/30/2015	$1,500,000.00	Michael Lisa	humanic@mps.ohio-state.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	Columbus	OH	432101016	6146888735	MPS	1233	7483	$0.00	This is a three-year project primarily to carry out experiments with relativistic heavy ion collisions. The goals for this program are three-fold. The first goal is to study the space-time properties of the extremely dense matter created in collisions between heavy nuclei at the highest achievable energies. It is believed that Quark Matter is created in these collisions, characterized by a large collection of quarks and gluons, the microscopic components of normal matter such as protons and neutrons. The second goal is to study the bulk phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), believed to be the correct theory to describe interactions between quarks and gluons. This will be achieved by varying the conditions of the collision to lower energies in order to probe the transition(s) between normal matter and Quark Matter. The third goal is to take the tools developed to study bulk physics in heavy ion collisions and apply them to proton-proton collisions at similar energies. We will look particularly for collective behavior, such as hydrodynamic flow, in these collisions. If our initial reports of such flow in proton-proton collisions are confirmed at these higher energies, this raises important issues about the nature of flow, and the nature of the initial state of these collisions. <br/><br/>In the present project, relativistic heavy ion collisions will be studied with gold-gold collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and with lead-lead collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva. RHIC, which started delivering beams in Summer 2000, is the highest energy heavy ion accelerator now in operation. In order to look for signatures that a phase transition to Quark Matter has taken place, one must study the properties of the particles produced in the collisions, such as particle momenta and multiplicities of each type that can be detected (e.g. pions, kaons, protons, and more exotic particles). This will be done at RHIC using the large acceptance detectors of the STAR experiment, which can sample most of the interesting particles per collision. The information obtained in this way can be used to determine, for example, the physical size of the interaction region (using two-particle interferometry), the temperatures reached in the collisions (from particle momentum distributions) and exotic particle production such as strange baryons. In addition, studies of proton-proton and lead-lead collisions at even higher energies at the LHC with the ALICE experiment will begin by April 2010. The LHC will provide beams 30 times higher in center-of-mass energy than RHIC, i.e. cosmic ray energies, making for a useful comparison with results from RHIC. <br/><br/>There are broader impacts to society of this project in the areas of education, technology and computing. Since undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will play key roles in this project, training will be provided to these groups in how to carry out research in large collaborations and in general problem solving skills. This research requires large-scale computing in order to acquire and analyze data on the teraflop and terabyte scale, and new methods in information science, such as computing grid systems, will be developed which can enhance the computing power of society as a whole.

It is also this variability of materials that adds daunting complexity to image understanding. This research program aims to establish the theoretical and computational foundation for automatic visual understanding and recognition of real-world materials. The program tackles this challenging problem from three key aspects, namely, deriving 1) novel hybrid physically-based and data-driven representations of the spatial, angular, spectral, temporal, and scale variations of material appearance, 2) active and passive methods for estimating the values of physically-based parameters that govern material appearance, and 3) single-image material recognition methods that leverage physically-based optical parameters as priors or invariants to guide machine learning techniques. These research thrusts lead to a comprehensive set of computational tools to recognize materials in real-world images despite their complex appearance variations, such as recognizing rusted metals, discerning soft cloth from hard concrete, identifying different fat content of milks, and labeling image regions with material traits like soft, hard, rough, and heavy.<br/><br/>The capabilities resulting from this program are crucial to a broad range of scenarios, for instance, to enable humanoid robots to understand that it should not squeeze the soft hands of a child, autonomous vehicles to understand what regions to avoid in a rugged terrain, visual analyses of tissues to help medical diagnosis, and automated inspection systems to reliably discover sub-standard quality food to prevent ill-health. The PIs work with research groups in these specific application areas to closely integrate the results from this project into their efforts. The results from this research are also broadly disseminated via publications, websites, databases, new courses and symposiums.

Waymouth at Stanford University and Dr. James L Hedrick at IBM for a research project that will explore new patterns of reactivity of organic catalysts for controlled polymerization reactions. Specific objectives are to: (1) develop novel bifunctional strategies for organocatalytic polymerization reactions; (2) develop a detailed kinetic and mechanistic understanding of zwitterionic polymerizations for the synthesis of macrocyclic polymers; and (3) develop new organocatalytic methods for the synthesis of biodegradable and biocompatible polyphosphates. The zwitterionic polymerization mediated by N-heterocyclic carbenes is a new conceptual advance for the enchainment of monomers to high molecular weight cyclic polymers. Mechanistic and kinetic insights on the details of these reactions will provide a conceptual and quantitative picture of the scope, power and limitations of this new synthetic method. Organocatalytic polymerization strategies provide an environmentally friendly approach for the synthesis and recycling of major commodity polymers. Mechanistic insights on new mechanisms of enchainment will create new opportunities for the generation of novel polymer architectures, including new families of polyphosphates for biomedical applications.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Drs. Waymouth and Hedrick will perform research that will provide new catalytic strategies for the design of biodegradable polymers derived from renewable resources. New synthetic methods developed as part of this program will enable new strategies for the synthesis of well-defined polymer architectures. These developments will enable studies of the role of polymer structure on properties and function, issues that are fundamental to our understanding of chemistry and to the application of macromolecules in modern technologies. Broader impacts include involving students in an exceptional training environment involving a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative effort between an academic institution and an industrial laboratory. The PIs have taken an active role in recruiting and mentoring underrepresented minorities and disabled students. In addition, IBM is committing significant resources to this effort, including laboratory and office space for a postdoctoral coworker and visiting Stanford students, materials and supplies, extensive access to IBM facilities and infrastructure as well as 25% of Dr. Hedrick's time.

By spatially patterning regions of captured helical cholesteric order surrounded by locked-in isotropic disorder in a periodic way, a rich variety of surface topologies can be created and thermally activated. Three fabrication methodologies are proposed to tailor surface relief features on different dimensions, including lithography for the micrometer-scale, holo-lithography for the meso-scale, and templating for the nano-scale. A battery of experiments will be performed (optics, thermo-optics, interference, electron, and confocal microscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance) to probe their thermal, structural, optical, and dynamic properties to elucidate their basic topology and underlying physical phenomena, and evaluate their potential use in applications. Both graduate students and undergraduate students will be trained to use these modern experimental techniques. An international collaboration with the Technical University of Eindhoven in the Netherlands has been established so students can capitalize on their facilities and expertise in reactive mesogen chemistry, as well as experience the importance of international collaboration. <br/><br/>%%%<br/><br/>An increasing interest in reactive liquid crystals (or mesogens) continues to emerge at the cross-disciplinary interface of liquid crystal science, offering unique opportunities to permanently capture various liquid crystalline phases and configurations for passive and active optical applications, and to further the fundamental understanding of liquid crystalline ordering. The goal of this proposal is to create a patterned polymer sample, which responds to heat. By applying heat to the sample, regions of the sample will expand (pop-up) and adjacent regions will remain level. This creates a film with differences in height across the sample. Since it is designed to be periodic, it may be useful for new optical devices that steer light. By understanding the basic science behind this novel effect, the material can potentially be optimized for use in a number of intriguing application areas, including telecommunications switches, flat panel displays, and security features for passports and currency. The research results emanating from this proposal will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate entrepreneurship courses where students strive to create commercial and societal value out of university discoveries and innovations. The graduate students participating in the research will also greatly benefit from the international research experience with the Technical University of Eindhoven in the Netherlands, where they will not only capitalize on scientific expertise and state of-the-art infrastructure, but they will also experience the research enterprise in a foreign country. The education outreach component of this proposal is far reaching - it is the goal of this work to inspire and enable young people in the Greater Providence Area, particularly those from neighborhoods of limited means and resources, those who have had educational troubles and behavioral problems, those who are incarcerated, and those with disabilities, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens using science and engineering as a vehicle. Two new educational outreach platforms will be developed to accomplish this ambitious goal, which includes the intersection of art/fashion and science, and a novel cartoon medium based on underlying scientific themes and facts.

In this project, supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Yoshitaka Ishii of the University of Illinois at Chicago and his research group will develop methods to drastically accelerate NMR spectroscopy for solid materials and biomolecules, which is generally called solid-state NMR (SSNMR). The proposed work would employ paramagnetic doping, very fast magic angle spinning, and an ultra high magnetic field in order to increase the speeds of the data collection 10-30 fold. Another component of the research involves 13C sample enrichment to facilitate SSNMR analysis of graphene/graphite based nano materials, in particular, graphene oxide and graphite oxide, at molecular level. <br/><br/>Prof. Ishii's research will advance NMR technology applications to insoluble proteins and non-crystalline materials which cannot be analyzed by other tools such as x-ray crystallography. Advances in the Ishii group research will likely have impacts in the many venues of NMR based technology, including nanomaterials analysis, and MRI. Professor Ishii will integrate his research into his educational activities by providing hands-on NMR experiments in a graduate NMR course, and in the physical chemistry laboratory for senior undergraduates. Professor Ishii will also develop MRI experiments in the undergraduate course by incorporating a gradient coil into an existing spectrometer for solution samples. Subsequent exercises will be developed that address the correlation of contrast-agent used in chemical imaging with relaxation time of an NMR signal. Finally, Professor Ishii will participate in the University of Illinois at Chicago's Summer Research Opportunities for Undergraduates Program (SROP).

These improvements depend on investments in, and the production of, new knowledge -- both in the laboratory and in commercial use. Because knowledge, due to its special nature, is notoriously difficult for private firms to control and profit from exclusively, it is argued that government support is required to assure that opportunities are not squandered. The literature is clear that the presence of multiple market failures and multiple technical options means that good government policy needs to have a portfolio of policies addressing a portfolio of technologies. However, there are many possible diversified portfolios. This research applies science to science and innovation policy in order to estimate the consequences of combinations of technology policy instruments on the climate and on the economy.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project aims to provide a framework for designing a portfolio of technology policies to address climate change. The researchers model the effects of combinations of policy instruments on a portfolio of technologies, when both the outcomes of the technology policies and the effects of climate change are uncertain. The project evaluates combinations of three policy instruments: government funded R&D; subsidies for demand; and carbon prices. It focuses on two important technologies: solar PV and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), while developing a framework amenable to the consideration of a larger set of technologies. Some of the key questions the project addresses are:<br/><br/>- What factors are most important in choosing the best the mix of R&D and Subsidies? How does this mix change with increasing uncertainty in climate damages?<br/>- What drives the optimal mix of a two-technology portfolio?<br/>- To what extent do R&D and subsidies affect the optimal level of emissions abatement?<br/>- How large is the hedging value that subsidies provide? <br/><br/> The researchers collect and use expert elicitations to estimate the probability of R&D investment producing technical improvements in CCS. Simultaneously and iteratively, they develop a bottom-up cost model to estimate the cost reductions expected from both economies of scale and learning-by-doing as deployment of CCS technology expands. They implement this model?along with an earlier model of solar PV?into an Integrated Assessment Model, allowing for the optimization of portfolios of policy instruments designed to reduce the cost of climate change mitigation. This configuration allows cost benefit optimization of policy choices under varying probability distributions over damages and technical outcomes.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Improved models that help improve the allocation of public funds could have an important fiscal impact. In addition, the research will inform the development of classes and train students in public policy model building.

This is a commonly used reaction in organic synthesis but is usually difficult to get good yields consistently. Professor Forbes has proposed a process that overcomes this limitation, and has found a way to improve reactions that have been reported in this area, which could lead to the development of new processes. Increased understanding of these key processes would provide a new method of high utility that can be used in a wide range of organic syntheses. The major goal of the proposal is to render this methodology catalytic in the sulfide promoter, making the methodology more atom efficient and opening avenues for chiral catalysis. This research is likely to lead to processes that are of great value to synthetic chemists and will have a significant impact on the chemistry community.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Forbes will perform research that addresses a long-standing problem in the potentially useful area of organocatalytic synthesis: that of catalytic sulfide-mediated methylene transfer using non-dangerous chemicals. This versatile and potentially environmentally benign methodology would have industrial applications of economic and environmental benefit. Broader impacts involve the training of undergraduate students in chemistry, outreach to local high school chemistry teachers through the Alabama Science in Motion (ASIM) Program, and ongoing collaborations, especially with industry.

Each year, four top US undergraduates will be selected from a nation-wide pool of applicants to conduct field research on spotted hyenas and other African carnivores. There is no other comparable field research-training program available that offers US undergraduate students the chance to study the biology of free-living African carnivores in one of the world's most magnificent game parks. <br/><br/>The IRES students will help expand the current research focus from single-species to a much richer comparative analysis of multiple sympatric species that inhabit the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem; IRES will also foster a training partnership with three highly experienced Kenyan scientists at the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), Nairobi, all of whom will mentor the US students. Aided by the mentoring team, the students will address a broad array of hypothesis- driven research questions about the behavior, conservation and physiology of African carnivores, ranging from the evolution of their cognitive abilities to anthropogenic effects on their stress physiology. <br/><br/>Before departure, students will participate in a rigorous web-based research and cultural orientation, and Swahili language training. In-country, they will train initially at the Kenya Wildlife Service HQ, and then transit to the tented research camp in the Masai Mara National Reserve where they will spend seven weeks developing and executing the research. Before leaving Kenya, the students will present their work at the Carnivore Researchers Conference held each year at the KWS HQ. <br/><br/>The research opportunities offered here are unparalleled, not only to investigate the biology of several carnivore species that remain poorly understood, but also to make important contributions in the intellectual domains of behavioral ecology, stress physiology, and conservation biology. It is expected that IRES student research will shed considerable new light on the basic mechanisms by which African carnivores interact with their environments and with one another. This newly acquired knowledge will be widely disseminated via conference presentations and publication in professional journals, and will be applied directly to carnivore management and conservation efforts in Kenya. For reference: http://www.naturalscience.msu.edu/students/undergraduate/enhance_your_experience/undergraduate_research/index.html<br/><br/>Additionally, participants in IRES will learn a great deal about African life and culture, and about the complexities associated with carnivore conservation in a developing country. By fostering long-lasting friendships and collaborations between Kenyans and Americans, this experience will contribute significantly to the development of a new generation of global scientists who are united in their desire to understand and protect the natural world.

It will also be beneficial to beginning post-doctoral researchers who have the need for further instruction. Thirty-seven student and post-doc participants have accepted our invitation to attend the School. Of these, 17 are from U. S. universities other than Maryland and Johns Hopkins and 11 are from abroad. The program fills a need since almost no universities in the United States, or even abroad, can afford to offer graduate instruction in aspects of turbulence beyond introductory courses of one or two semesters.<br/><br/>The School will focus on recent developments in the understanding of turbulence, its prediction and control using modern experimental and analytical techniques and powerful numerical simulation capabilities. Tutorials on turbulence theory, experimental and simulation methods, turbulent transport in single and two phase flows and applications of turbulence will be given by lecturers from the University of Maryland, Johns Hopkins University and elsewhere. Ample open discussion time will provide opportunities for student and faculty participants to have a rich exchange of ideas. Afternoon experiential learning sessions will be conducted at workstations and in laboratories.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The turbulent motion of liquids and gases is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and engineering. Such fluid motion is fundamental to the formation of planets from interstellar clouds of particulates, to the dynamics of the earth's atmosphere and oceans that determine weather systems, to the mixing of reactants in combustion, to the dispersion of pollutants from smokestacks and storm sewers, and to the health risks caused by diseased arteries, to name but a few examples.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/><br/>Understanding and modeling the physics of turbulent motion is the basis of predicting its effects in a wide variety of natural occurrences important to human welfare and controlling it in engineering applications such as the design of air and surface vehicles, efficient engines for propulsion, heat exchangers and stents and heart valves.

Main St, Suite 710	Durham	NC	277054010	9196843030	SBE	1392	1392	$0.00	Feeding systems are the energy-acquiring systems of humans and other primates. The teeth, jaws, and muscles, are the proximal interface between primates and their environments. Therefore, understanding the evolutionary forces that shape those components is essential to understanding the adaptation and evolution of primates. This work tests hypotheses and models relating diversity in the primate feeding system to size-related changes in food intake rate. It documents how shape and movements of the mandible, the size and architecture of the jaw muscles, and the amount of food an animal eats in a single bite change with body size to meet size-required changes in food intake rate of primates. These data will be collected using computed tomography (CT) scanning of primate mandibles, anatomical studies of primate chewing muscles, and behavioral studies of primates feeding in captivity. Mathematical models of the feeding system will be tested, modified and improved, then used to examine how feeding system designs in different evolutionary groups of primates balance trade-offs between advantages of bite force production, chewing speed and gape. <br/><br/>This research will create novel and important data sets that can be accessed in the future by other researchers interested in feeding biomechanics, bone biomechanics, and musculoskeletal systems in general. The investigators will continue to recruit under-represented minority and female undergraduates to receive training and mentoring in research and advice on their paths to graduate, medical, and other professional schools. These students will collaborate in all aspects of the work, including presentation and publication. The PIs will continue their outreach programs to local schools and their synergistic activities with other NSF-funded projects.

These improvements depend on investments in, and the production of, new knowledge -- both in the laboratory and in commercial use. Because knowledge, due to its special nature, is notoriously difficult for private firms to control and profit from exclusively, it is argued that government support is required to assure that opportunities are not squandered. The literature is clear that the presence of multiple market failures and multiple technical options means that good government policy needs to have a portfolio of policies addressing a portfolio of technologies. However, there are many possible diversified portfolios. This research applies science to science and innovation policy in order to estimate the consequences of combinations of technology policy instruments on the climate and on the economy.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project aims to provide a framework for designing a portfolio of technology policies to address climate change. The researchers model the effects of combinations of policy instruments on a portfolio of technologies, when both the outcomes of the technology policies and the effects of climate change are uncertain. The project evaluates combinations of three policy instruments: government funded R&D; subsidies for demand; and carbon prices. It focuses on two important technologies: solar PV and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), while developing a framework amenable to the consideration of a larger set of technologies. Some of the key questions the project addresses are:<br/><br/>- What factors are most important in choosing the best mix of R&D and subsidies? How does the mix change with increasing uncertainty in climate damages?<br/>- What drives the optimal mix of a two-technology portfolio?<br/>- To what extent do R&D and subsidies affect the optimal level of emissions abatement?<br/>- How large is the hedging value that subsidies provide? <br/><br/>The researchers collect and use expert elicitations to estimate the probability of R&D investment producing technical improvements in CCS. Simultaneously and iteratively, they develop a bottom-up cost model to estimate the cost reductions expected from both economies of scale and learning-by-doing as deployment of CCS technology expands. They implement this model -- together with an earlier model of solar PV -- into an Integrated Assessment Model, allowing for the optimization of portfolios of policy instruments designed to reduce the cost of climate change mitigation. This configuration allows cost benefit optimization of policy choices under varying probability distributions over damages and technical outcomes.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Improved models that help improve the allocation of public funds could have an important fiscal impact. In addition, the research will inform the development of classes and train students in public policy model building.

Yet, civic engagement is uneven at best, and thoughtful public deliberation about major issues is often displaced either by apathy or shrill and extreme voices. This project develops new ways for citizens and government to communicate using social-computational systems. The project develops systems that facilitate adding crisp, relatively neutral summaries alongside advocacy statements; jointly-authored position statements, with flexible ways to sign on to existing statements, fork new ones, and understand and track changes; and enhanced moderation techniques. A partnership with the City of Seattle is enabling the researchers to test their ideas and systems in actual use.<br/><br/>The research studies a set of difficult and unsolved research issues in social-computational systems. How can systems support alternate divisions of labor among citizens and government, including effective support for automating some tasks and making the remaining tasks easy for human participants to work on? How can systems effectively support understanding a range of positions, and highlight who is agreeing or disagreeing and why? How can engagement systems allow and encourage effectively building on others' ideas and opinions? How can they handle strategic activity in which individuals or groups flood the system with duplicate posts, or create multiple accounts to give the impression of widespread support? How can input be effectively summarized and presented? The broader impacts of the work are substantial: if successful, this research will strengthen democratic process by facilitating effective citizen participation and deliberation.
0949550	Collaborative Research: Nutrient co-limitation in young and mature northern hardwood forests	DEB	ECOSYSTEM STUDIES	07/01/2010	04/02/2014	Joel Blum	MI	University of Michigan Ann Arbor	Standard Grant	Matthew Kane	06/30/2016	$84,178.00		jdblum@umich.edu	3003 South State St. Room 1062	Ann Arbor	MI	481091274	7347636438	BIO	1181	1181, 1355, 9169, 9178, 9251, EGCH, SMET	$0.00	Nutrient Co-limitation in Young and Mature Northern Hardwood Forests<br/><br/>Temperate forests have long been thought to be nitrogen (N) limited, but chronic N deposition from air pollution should reduce N limitation over time, and theory suggests that ecosystem productivity should be co-limited by multiple nutrients. Experimental tests of N vs. phosphorus (P) limitation in temperate forest systems are lacking. This study will combine modeling and field studies to explore processes mediating nutrient colimitation in relation to successional change in managed hardwood forest ecosystems. An improved understanding of ecosystem optimization of resource use, including the maintenance of co-limitation, is important to forest management, environmental protection, and basic scientific knowledge. Balanced nutrient cycling is essential to maintaining forest sustainability, and scientists and managers at the White Mountain National Forest will evaluate silvicultural practices in light of results from the proposed research. For example, their forest management plans require justifying intensive harvest removals in terms of the ability of forests to acquire nutrients for regrowth. Feedbacks such as the biological enhancement of mineral weathering when nutrients are limiting are clearly relevant to this appraisal.<br/>The Multi-Element Limitation (MEL) model represents co-limitation from the perspective of resource optimization theory and ecosystem biogeochemistry. We have extended the model to include P as well as N, carbon, light, and water, and applied it to simulate primary and secondary succession in northern hardwood forests. Using nutrient additions of N alone in some forest stands, P alone in some forest stands, N+P in some forest stands, in replicated stands of three ages (~20, 30, and > 100 years) at the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, we will test the patterns of resource limitation predicted by the model and multiple mechanisms of allocation of effort to acquire N and P. Specifically, the model predicts a greater response of aboveground productivity to N+P than N or P alone. In older stands, it predicts a greater response to N than to P addition, but in younger stands, the model suggests that the supply of N from detritus should be sufficient to create P limitation.

A large-scale, slow seismic-velocity anomaly in the lower mantle beneath the Pacific has been imaged in tomographic studies. The thermal and compositional structure of this anomaly remains poorly understood. This research integrates seismological and geodynamical efforts to investigate important issues in understanding the structure of this deep seismic anomaly. We will use thermochemical convection models to develop candidate mantle structures that can be investigated with seismic wave propagation simulations using realistic earthquake and receiver geometries. This will allow us to identify seismic phases that are sensitive to differences between the candidate mantle structures and to investigate whether finite-frequency theory provides additional insight beyond ray-theory for the geometry of these structures, and how 3-D attenuation structure affects our interpretation of tomographic images. <br/><br/>This research addresses several challenging problems in understanding the thermal and chemical structure in the Pacific lower mantle through seismic wave propagation in thermo-chemical plume models with focuses on (1) the sensitivity of seismic waves to 3-D variations in temperature and compositional in the lower mantle; (2) the effects of different scaling parameters in translation between temperature and compositional anomalies to seismic wave speed and anelastic attenuation and (3) the resolution limits of current seismic data (including USArray data) and seismic tomographic methods (ray theory and finite-frequency theory) in imaging the structure of the Pacific lower mantle and distinguishing between different plume models including 1) the 'standard' isochemical whole mantle model, with a cluster of narrow plumes under the central Pacific, 2) a thermochemical 'dome' (or pile) under the central Pacific with plumes arising from the interface, and 3) an isolated, sluggish lower mantle with upper mantle derived plumes. Seismological challenges, including quantifying the relative importance of anelastic attenuation and focusing-defocusing effects, and tradeoffs between elastic and anelastic structure will be addressed with full wave propagation simulations in a variety of thermochemical plume models.

Membranes can play an enormous role in energy-efficient chemical separations, but traditional polymeric membranes suffer from a trade-off between selectivity and throughput. The premise of this proposal is that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have enormous promise as membranes for large-scale separations because of their potential for rational design of micropore size, shape, and functionality. Almost nothing is currently known about the performance of MOFs as membranes. Equally importantly, almost nothing is known regarding which of the thousands of MOF materials would be productive to pursue for membrane fabrication. Preliminary modeling work by us and experiments by others have demonstrated, however, that MOFs can be fabricated into membranes and that the performance of these membranes can be predicted under practical operating conditions. This field is poised for rapid growth, and our collaborative team is well positioned to lead this area. The proposed work will use a combination of computational modeling and experimental studies to develop new membranes based on MOFs.<br/><br/>This project will create many noteworthy opportunities for education and training. The research efforts will be linked with an innovative high school curriculum being developed in Gwinnett County, GA. The highly interdisciplinary approach will create learning opportunities for a variety of students: K-12, undergraduate, and PhD-level at Georgia Tech, including external undergraduates from underrepresented groups recruited through the SURE program.

The central theme of the project is the extraction of astrophysical information from gravitational-wave observations. Building on broad expertise, the group will engage in specific activities spanning all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy. The award will foster synergy by focusing expertise in gravitational physics, astrophysics, and grid-computing on gravitational-wave data analysis challenges that are on the critical path to the scientific success of LIGO.<br/><br/>Gravitational waves are a fundamental prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Yet almost 100 years after the theory was put forward these waves have eluded direct detection. Having recently constructed exquisitely sensitive detectors, such as LIGO, scientists from the United States and around the world are poised to make the first detection. With these instruments now operational, the challenge is to dig deep into their data to find the imprint of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources, such as black holes, neutron stars, and signals from the beginning of the universe. The first detection will usher in a new era of scientific discovery: the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. This work will make a significant contribution to many critical-path components of the LIGO data analysis effort, which will enable the first detection of gravitational waves and the wealth of astrophysical information thereby garnered. This award also supports research into the nature of highly energetic astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation which will provide valuable insight into the nature of Einstein's theory of gravity. Graduate students receive valuable training in the emerging field of gravitational wave science.

Although researchers have demonstrated relevant capabilities within laboratory environments, current methods are untested and potentially unsuitable for the variability of real-world healthcare environments. In order to address this critical issue, the new infrastructure funded by this award consists of a state-of-the-art robot (a mobile manipulator) dedicated to research conducted outside of the lab via collaborations with healthcare researchers and providers. The robot spends extended periods of time (residencies) in environments where assistive robots are expected to make a positive impact, including the homes of persons with disabilities, assisted living environments for the elderly, and clinical facilities. These residencies enable robotics researchers to maximize the impact of their research by identifying and addressing the roadblocks to deployment of autonomous mobile manipulators for healthcare. The research supported by this infrastructure will result in new methods for assistive manipulation and contributions to compliant arm control, multi-modal perception, and human-robot interaction. It will also begin to quantitatively characterize the variability of real-world healthcare environments. Results of this research will be communicated via academic publications, a website, open source code, and publicly released data captured with the robot. The robot will also have residencies at Spelman College (an HBCU for women) to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.

0961344	Collaborative Research: A mechanistic understanding of biogeographic patterns and life histories in benthic organisms in advective coastal environments	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	06/15/2010	06/15/2010	James Pringle	NH	University of New Hampshire	Standard Grant	David L.

Contributing factors are offspring of species with planktonic larvae being physically transported outside their natal range, and adults thriving when transplanted into regions immediately beyond their natural distributions. It is unclear, however, why long-distance dispersal of a benthic organism's larva should persist on evolutionary timescales. There is more larval dispersal from natal habitat than would seem propitious. Furthermore, long larval duration is known to increase reproductive output for species persistence, makes population retention of favorable alleles less likely, and reduces the genetic diversity of the population.<br/><br/>The Co-PIs have shown that maintenance of range boundaries for a species are governed by a function analogous to that derived for allelic frequency/genetic clines in the coastal ocean. As with other recent advances in biodiversity theory, this work suggests a convergence between conditions that maintain the distribution of alleles within species and those that maintain the distribution of species themselves. This confluence of theory provides substantial opportunity for development of inter- and intra-species competition in an advective environment. It potentially would unify genetic and population-level theory, and create a holistic view of life in advective environs. <br/><br/>It is clear from preliminary work that a synthesis would depend critically on tradeoffs between dispersal mode and successful reproductive output. The theory would be developed both by pushing its analytical envelope, and by drawing upon extensive, existing databases to quantitatively constrain reproductive and dispersal tradeoffs. For example, although tradeoffs between larval quantity versus quality (i.e., many energetically cheap larvae versus few highly provisioned individuals) have long been the subject of qualitative models, they have not been quantitatively defined for life history characteristics of different benthic marine taxa. Combining analytical developments and observed life-history tradeoffs would provide 1) evolutionarily stable states for a range of dispersal strategies, 2) mechanisms that define species boundaries as a function of physical (e.g., temperature and alongshore variation in currents) and biological (like larval mortality) parameters and 3) quantitative origins of dispersal behaviors that would locally retain larvae, and result in relationships between inter- and intra-species fitness. <br/><br/>Such findings would predict species boundary locations and the presence/absence of various dispersal strategies as a function of local circulation, environmental conditions and their gradients. Predictions would be tested against data on species ranges gathered as part of an extensive literature and database search. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: This research would allow a better mechanistic understanding species' ranges that occur due to changes in the Earth's climate. For example, this study will test the hypothesis that warming favors species with longer larval planktonic duration. Therefore, high-latitude areas now dominated by species with direct development would shift to a mixture of planktonic dispersers and direct developers as the climate warms. The research would allow managers to understand how disruption to habitat can alter species ranges by changing alongshore sources and transport of planktonic larvae. A quantitative theory of species range will also help managers understand what sets the ultimate limits of recently introduced exotic species, allowing improvement of management strategies. This proposal includes the following education components. Two graduate students will be trained in cutting-edge techniques in the fields of quantitative phylogeography and biogeography. In addition, two undergraduate students each year will assist with all aspects of the project and will present their work at a national meeting. The students will be mentored to write REU proposals to NSF. Undergraduates will be recruited with the help of the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, of which UGA is a flagship member. Undergraduates will also be recruited from the Research and Discovery Program at UNH, from colleges with limited opportunities for undergraduate research.

This supersolid state has the remarkable property that a fraction of a helium solid can actually pass through itself as a frictionless flow provide the temperature is low enough.  This property of the supersolid is counterintuitive and is at odds with our instinctive concept of a solid.  The supersolid may be another example of a superfluid system to take its place beside the previously know superfluids; superfluid 4He and superfluid 3He, superconducting electrons, and the superfluids observed in low density trapped atomic gases.  One of the most important questions that must be addressed is whether the supersolid phenomena thus far observed is actual evidence for a true superfluid state in solid helium. This research project will address this question on two fronts. The approach asks the question, does the superfluid obey superfluid hydrodynamics?  The second approach will examine the nature of the phase transition to the supersolid state by an ultra sensitive heat capacity measurement utilizing state-of-the-art superconducting technology. These projects will involve several undergraduate students and will give them a head start in scientific research.<br/><br/><br/>****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****<br/><br/>The recent discovery of a Supersolid phase in solid 4He at temperatures below 200 mK by the Eunsong Kim and Moses Chan provides the realization of a prediction made more than a quarter of a century ago.  The initial suggestion for a supersolid state in crystalline 4He is based on the possibility that Bose-Einstein condensation might occur in solid helium at sufficiently low temperatures. It is crucial to establish whether or not the supersolid state represents a new type of superfluid. This individual investigator award supports an attempt to clarify this issue using several approaches. First, the hydrodynamics of the supersolid will be examined in non-circular geometries where the predicted behavior based on ordinary superfluid hydrodynamics is clear. Second, the question of an actual phase transition to the supersolid state will be addressed through measurement of the possible heat capacity anomaly associated with the transition utilizing ultra sensitive SQUID technology. This project is expected to involve two undergraduate students who should profit greatly from working in a fast evolving area at the current forefront of condensed matter research.

The research component at KTH, in the School of Chemical Science and Engineering, will involve the training of IRES participants in AFM-based colloidal probe characterization for measuring particle-particle interactions and linker-patch binding strengths in patchy particle systems. Overall, these activities should help build a growing US-Swedish materials network of junior and senior researchers. Results are expected to lead to novel measurements of particle-particle interactions and linker-patch binding which may contribute to future work in applied electrochemistry and biotechnology in areas such as surface and corrosion science, functional materials, and wood chemistry. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this US-Swedish IRES include the introduction of students from underrepresented groups, i.e., minority and female students, to a research environment at a leading European institution while providing all participants with early career mentoring. IRES participants will be recruited from the Grove School of Engineering and the New York City-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program. Each participant will be mentored by the PI through biweekly meetings during the academic year and prepared for their international research experience in the PI?s laboratory. Prior to their travel to Stockholm, IRES participants will develop a summer research plan with their KTH mentors and the PI. The research experience itself will provide the students with a unique perspective on the scientific approach to problem solving and give them a global perspective on colloids research.<br/><br/>Further, IRES participants will share their experience via publications in the CCNY Journal for Student Research and presentations at the Urban Conference Series, the NSF Engineering Education Awardees Conference, and an annual Bridge-to-the-Doctorate retreat. Consistent with IRES objectives, this dissemination effort will provide U.S. students, many from from underrepresented groups, with ample role models while demonstrating the importance of obtaining international research experience. Altogether, this meets the NSF goal of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Europe to combine complementary talents and share research and education resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
0948386	Collaborative Research: Australia Down Under: Quantification of Rates and Amount of Continental Subduction During Neogene Arc-continent Collision on Timor	EAR	TECTONICS	06/15/2010	03/02/2012	Ronald Harris	UT	Brigham Young University	Continuing grant	David Fountain	05/31/2014	$152,988.00		rharris@byu.edu	A-285 ASB	Provo	UT	846021231	8014226177	GEO	1572	0000	$0.00	The objective of this project is to test whether arc-continent collision events modify overall convergence rates, with the island of Timor as test-case. The mountainous island of Timor exposes a tectono-stratigraphic section of a typical arc-continent collision, with elements from the overriding Asian oceanic/arc plate, a wedge of high pressure/low temperature metamorphic rocks and an underlying deformed Australian continental passive margin sedimentary sequence. An accurate geologic map of the Island, which describes the distribution of rock types and structures, will be produced that will form the basis for balanced structural cross-sections, which, in turn, will be used to quantify how much the sedimentary rocks once deposited on the margin have been telescoped during collision. The magnitude of shortening should correlate with the amount of continental crust that has been subducted. Paleomagnetic analysis is used to determine paleolatitude, rotation, and age of strata. High- to low-temperature thermochronologic data will document the magnitude, variability, and timing of exhumation.<br/><br/>Shortly after the recognition of plate tectonics, the Wilson cycle was introduced in order to describe the creation and demise of ocean basins. The original four stages ? continental rifting, seafloor spreading and formation of ocean basins, closure of ocean basins by subduction of oceanic lithosphere, and continent-continent collision - still form a fundamental basis for our understanding of tectonic processes. Arc-continent collision marks the ultimate demise of an intra-oceanic subduction zone and is a common phenomenon during ocean closure. It is usually assumed that significant underthrusting of continental material under an oceanic island arc is inhibited by buoyancy but the magnitude of continental subduction remains unconstrained. This project will provide an estimate for the magnitude of continental crust that has been subducted, results that would have important implications for mantle chemistry and dynamics. The project involves a significant collaboration with researchers from Norway, Swiss, Australia, and Indonesia as well as training of U.S. and international students.
0968863	Collaborative Research: CSEDI--Grand Challenge for Experimental Study of Plastic Deformation Under Deep Earth Conditions	EAR	GEOPHYSICS	07/01/2010	05/07/2012	William Durham	MA	Massachusetts Institute of Technology	Continuing grant	Robin Reichlin	06/30/2014	$261,415.00		wbdurham@mit.edu	77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE	Cambridge	MA	021394301	6172531000	GEO	1574	0000, 1031	$0.00	The main goal of this joint project is to further develop the experimental techniques of studying plastic deformation under deep Earth conditions. When a large force (stress) is applied to minerals or rocks under shallow Earth conditions, they will be deformed by brittle fracture. In the deep interior of Earth, temperature is higher and then plastic deformation becomes possible. This plastic deformation helps material circulation by convection that cools Earth and causes most of geological activities including mountain building and deep circulation of water and other materials. However, to date very little is known on the plastic flow properties of materials under deep Earth conditions due mainly to the technical difficulties. For example, in the deep interior of Earth, not only is temperature high, but also pressure is high. Usually pressure suppresses atomic motion and hence plastic deformation becomes difficult under high-pressure conditions. Does the role of pressure become more important than temperature and hence the viscosity of materials increases with depth? Also most of minerals undergo a series of phase transformations. How do these phase transformations affect the plastic properties? These issues are critical to our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of Earth and other terrestrial planets. <br/><br/>Despite its importance, almost nothing was known about these deep earth deformation as recently as ~ten years ago. Recognizing this need, the investigators started a group effort to develop new techniques of plastic deformation under deep Earth conditions in 2002. Based on the studies during the previous funding periods, they have made major progress including the development of new types of deformation apparatus and the improvements to the stress (and strain) measurements using synchrotron x-ray sources. As a result, we can now conduct quantitative deformation experiments to ~20 GPa and ~2000 K. However, these conditions correspond only to the depth of ~500 km. Earth's mantle extends to ~2900 km. Also, there has been very poor control of water content in materials previously studied. In this new phase of technical development, the team of investigators will focus on (i) extending the maximum pressure to ~30 GPa and higher (~1000 km depth), (ii) improving the control of chemical environment (such as water fugacity) under high-pressure conditions, and (iii) improving the stress measurements through the use of new hardware and theory. These developments will allow investigation of the plastic properties of Earth materials to the conditions equivalent to the shallow part of the lower mantle under well-controlled chemical environment. Applications of these techniques will shed important new light into our understanding of dynamics of whole Earth. The project is a collaboration among teams at four institutions, and will provide enhanced infrastructure to the experimental geophysics community, including new facilities at national synchrotron beamlines that will be available to the broader community. The developments will include training and mentoring of graduate students and post doctoral scholars.

The survival and maintenance of proper balances of living biomass and masses of nutrients, dissolved gases, vegetation, fish, and marine life, as well as the inadvertent or planned intrusion of a wide variety of pollutants and contaminants, are major concerns. The effectiveness with which water is drawn into, or purged from, these cavity like regions has important consequences for water quality. Such mass exchange involves shallow mixing layers, which have scales of instabilities and vortices much larger than the water depth. <br/><br/>This program aims to fundamentally alter the approaches to, and our understanding of, shallow mixing layers of finite streamwise extent. Space time quantitative imaging will yield new representations of the flow structure of finite length shallow mixing layers, and thereby provide insight into the mass engulfment/exchange between the cavity and the region exterior to it. Such imaging will account for stabilization and destabilization of instabilities and vortex formation within the shallow mixing layer, arising from the effects of finite length scale and a standing gravity wave within the cavity. This approach will lead to a new, physics based framework for mass exchange between the cavity and its surroundings, in contrast to exchange coefficients empirically determined from flushing or purging times, and eventually contribute to enhanced water accessibility and quality, which is of increasing concern to nearly all developed and underdeveloped countries. <br/><br/>An outreach program for underrepresented students will involve an integrated program, with several different initiatives, for a middle school and a community college having high percentages of minorities, in anticipation of the increasingly important role of community colleges.

A facility is envisioned to house approximately sixty American students in the greater Geneva community, to provide them with proper supervision and security, to provide a structure for repatriating to their U.S. institutes course credit for their participation in cutting-edge data collection and analysis efforts at these facilities, and for any approved courses they take during their research and field study abroad period. It is expected, based on the experience of the CERN REU program, that the students will contribute in real and meaningful ways to the research program underway at CERN, and by extension, to the World Health Organization and other institutions based in Geneva.

In particular, instruments <br/>will be developed that: <br/>1) probe for ``large'' extra dimensions by testing Newton's inverse-square law down to length scales substantially smaller than the diameter of a human hair, <br/>2) test Einstein's Weak Equivalence Principle with a sensitivity fifty times better than previously published results, <br/>3) look for quantum gravity effects by testing Lorentz symmetry or charge-parity (CP) and charge-parity-time (CPT) violation,<br/>4) search for the force produced by axion-like particles with masses around 1000 micro-eV, <br/>5) operate at temperatures close to absolute zero to study factors that limit torsion-balance sensitivity.<br/><br/>The Eot-Wash Group has consistently provided the most precise studies of the broadly interesting issues they investigate. This required technical innovations that have found applications in other areas such as ground and space-based gravitational-wave detection. The Group's results are used by elementary-particle, gravitational and cosmological theorists to constrain interesting new ideas, are widely disseminated through publications, review papers, colloquia, invited talks, lab tours and public lectures, and are featured in magazine and newspaper articles in this country and in Europe. The variety of scientific issues addressed by the Group and the many experimental challenges involved provide an excellent education in experimental physics for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as unusually attractive opportunities for undergraduate research projects.

Specimens from these collections are heavily used by scientists and educators. Of particular interest are the many large specimens that are rare in collections and add greatly to the value of the UF collections. Although the University of Florida (UF) continues to support the museum's collections and recently has dedicated and improved major expansions of space, the serious problem of improper storage for the largest specimens remains. These specimens are stored in ArcaSystems tanks and large plastic barrels. Several tanks and barrels have developed cracks and a few have leaked, exposing specimens and spreading alcohol over large areas, causing unpleasant and at times hazardous conditions. As the tanks age, more are developing cracks and becoming a serious threat to the integrity of some of the most valuable specimens. Funding from NSF will allow UF to provide improved storage for large specimens by replacing inadequate containers with archival stainless steel tanks. Stainless steel tanks are nearly indestructible and leak-proof. In transferring specimens to new tanks, labels and database records will be updated. These activities will guarantee the long-term preservation of valuable specimens and maximize their utility to scientists and educators well into the future. FLMNH serves a broad clientele, including researchers and a diversity of scholars, students, and resource managers. This project will allow UF to continue to make comprehensive information accessible to researchers, educators, and decision-makers who depend on knowledge of biological diversity. The collections are important components of undergraduate and graduate education at UF and are used in educational programs ranging from public exhibits, workshops, and tours to university courses. The FLMNH ichthyology collection can be found at http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Collection/collection.htm.

Currently there is limited knowledge of how bacterial adaptation to different host environments dictates whether a particular microbe will cause benefit or harm, despite the important implications of such knowledge in preventing or promoting specific bacterial interactions. This research focuses on understanding how bacteria sense and respond to different host environments to initiate expression of either beneficial or harmful traits. The bacterium being studied expresses beneficial traits when it is associated with a small soil-dwelling roundworm (nematode), and expresses virulence traits when it is associated with insect larvae. As part of its natural life cycle, the nematode transmits (vectors) the bacterium into the insect larva. In this new environment, the bacterium expresses virulence traits, and kills the insect. The insect cadaver then serves as a nutrient source for reproduction and further dissemination of both the nematode and bacteria. This research will examine the complex molecular circuitries that coordinate and regulate the expression of beneficial and harmful traits as the bacteria move between different animal hosts. The paradigms revealed by this research will provide broad insights into such questions as: how does bacterial adaptation to new environments alter symbiotic behavior, and how do vector-borne disease-causing bacteria adapt during transmission by the vector? <br/><br/>The results of this research will be published and disseminated to the public through community seminars and high school outreach programs. Undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students will be trained in areas of molecular biology, nematology, entomology, and bacteriology through direct scientific inquiry. Thus, this project will provide fundamental knowledge of bacterial interactions with animal hosts, and will train future scientists with the expertise to further apply this knowledge.

Specifically the investigators are (1) developing a full suite of haptics-augmented statics and dynamics activities to complement standard textbooks; (2) evaluating these products in two large engineering schools; (3) developing curricula that integrates these products into statics and dynamics courses; (4) applying educational pedagogy research for experiential inquiry-based learning and implementing a learner-based hypothesis generation and testing procedure to encourage learners to translate tactile responses to their real world causes; and (5) using a design research approach in the evaluation process to make it an integral part of the development process. They are working to commercialize a unique CD-based set of software activities and tutorials that will enable students to change parameters, predict answers, interact with animations, and feel the results through the haptic device. The evaluation effort, under the direction of an experienced, independent evaluator, is examining student work captured on video along with student surveys and focus groups to monitor student learning. The broader impacts will include the dissemination of their products and results, particularly through commercialization and linking the material to successful textbooks.

The overall objective is to quantify interannual variability of estuarine circulation, stratification, and salinity, to explain the physical mechanisms responsible for such variability, and provide an assessment of the likely changes in these metrics in response to future climate change. Observational analysis and 3-Dimensional modeling will be focused on Chesapeake and Delaware Bays, for which (a) extensive salinity databases exist, and (b) a robust numerical model has been developed and validated. Process-oriented modeling studies will be conducted to examine how the estuaries respond to interannual variability in river runoff and shelf salinity, sea-level rise and potential changes in tidal and wind mixing. Multiple model hindcasts will be conducted in which the individual impacts of interannual variability in open-ocean sea level, river flow, shelf salinity, and meteorological forcing are assessed. Statistical models will be applied to the historical salinity data to investigate how salt intrusion length and estuarine stratification vary with river flow, shelf salinity and sea level rise. Projections of future climate impacts on these estuaries will be made by using the regional output of state-of-the art climate models that have been extensively evaluated for the Mid-Atlantic region. General insights into the sensitivity of estuarine physical processes to climate variability and change will be afforded by (1) the differing physics of Chesapeake Bay (partially mixed) and Delaware Bay (well mixed); (2) process oriented and realistic 3-Dimensional modeling studies; and (3) configuration of 2-Dimensional semi-analytical models over a large parameter space of river flow, tidal velocity amplitude, and estuarine geometry.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit.

To ensure true scalability, the techniques will be benchmarked on very-large-scale games of negotiation, auctions, and poker. This work is on a path toward a vision where software agents conduct commerce on behalf of humans, or at least advise them to act more intelligently. This will lead to increased social welfare through better decision making. This will also enable broader and fairer access because it will help put less experienced/educated people/companies on an equal footing with expert market participants.

Cohen at the University of California- San Diego for a research project that will use post-synthetic modification (PSM) to alter metal organic framework (MOF) materials to introduce a range of functionalities without disrupting the overall structure and porosity of the MOFs. Post-synthetic modification is emerging as a useful tool to access functionalized MOFs that cannot be prepared directly. These materials will be useful as both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Although there are now quite a few examples of MOFs that have been used as heterogeneous catalysts, the proposal correctly identifies catalysis as an area of MOF chemistry that is under-developed. Preliminary studies show that chiral substituents, organocatalytic groups (carboxylic acids, ureas), and metal-binding groups can be readily introduced into MOFs by PSM. Early studies show that these modified MOFs are useful for catalytic reactions.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Cohen will perform research that contributes to metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) becoming more widespread as a material of choice for energy, catalysis, and biomedical applications. Based on these technological applications, and because of the growing importance of postsynthetic modification (PSM) of MOFs, Professor Cohen's work has garnered substantial attention from outside the immediate MOF community. Most notably is a recent paper on the use of MOFs as solid-state catalysts via PSM (Angew. Chem. 2009) that has gathered substantial attention in the catalysis discipline. This proposal also includes a novel broader impacts/teaching activity to develop internships and coursework in science policy. A Science Policy Summer Program at the University of California Center in Washington D.C. (called UC in DC) is being created. The PI is the Director of this new program that involves training of physical, biological, mathematical, and engineering science students in the importance of science in public policy. The program will involve special activities such as seminars, tours, in addition to coursework and science policy internships. This innovative program will impact students across the University of California system, and help to create a generation of scientists who better appreciate their role in society and in government.

0962967	Collaborative Research: Development of a next generation sensor for measuring biologically available iron in seawater	OCE	OCEAN TECH & INTERDISC COORDIN	06/15/2010	06/15/2010	Mark Wells	CA	University of California-Santa Cruz	Standard Grant	Kandace S. Binkley	05/31/2014	$356,838.00		mlwells@maine.edu	1156 High Street	Santa Cruz	CA	950641077	8314595278	GEO	1680		$0.00	There is increasing evidence that iron is important not only in the regulation of bulk phytoplankton production in large regions of the world oceans, but that it also profoundly influences the speciation of algae within the phytoplankton assemblage. The broad implications resulting from these dual effects range from impacts on the global carbon cycle to the possible stimulation of harmful algal blooms. There is a strong need for ultra-sensitive, real-time monitoring and detection technologies that capture the reactive iron pool in seawater that is available to eukaryotic phytoplankton.<br/><br/>The PI?s request funding to ?biocalibrate? the reactive iron fraction to gain a measure of iron availability to marine eukaryotic phytoplankton. The PI?s will combine Time Resolved Fluorescence (TRF) and Fluorescence Resonate Energy Transfer (FRET) to develop an ultra-sensitive photoactive nanodevice that uses the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFB) as the iron-selective sensor interface, lanthanide fluorescence to report the presence of iron in this receptor, and Q-dot nanocrystals to greatly amplify this signal to achieve the picomolar level sensitivity needed to study both coastal and offshore ocean waters<br/><br/>The sensor will be calibrated with a range of nearshore and offshore species of cyanobacteria, diatoms and dinoflagellates, and the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi; phytoplankton important in the regulation of carbon export from surface to the deep ocean. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a photoactive nanosensor that allows real-time in situ measurements that reflect phytoplankton growth rates.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/><br/>The development of new generation of sensor to measure labile iron in-situ will greatly advance our knowledge of iron biogeochemistry. In addition, due to extremely short response time, this sensor will provide a unique opportunity to measure iron kinetics, cycling which is one of the biggest challenge in this research area, believe to be critical to control iron bioavailability to phytoplankton. Therefore this project will certainly lead to the burgeoning of this research area, potentially leading to new findings. In addition to supporting graduate students and undergrads, this proposal involves middle school teachers. Orcutt has obviously established productive relationships with local educators, and the letters from these teachers outlining their enthusiasm for continuing the relationship gives confidence that the proposed work will lead to an effective educational outcome. The potential for involvement of minority students at Southern Miss. is also significant. The proposed work also has the benefit of ?fertilizing? the field of oceanography with advances in other sciences (chemistry, materials).
0969837	Collaborative Research: Structural Integrity of Steel Gravity Framing Systems	CMMI	Structural and Architectural E	07/01/2010	06/25/2010	Judy Liu	IN	Purdue University	Standard Grant	Kishor Mehta	06/30/2014	$100,000.00		judy.liu@oregonstate.edu	Young Hall	West Lafayette	IN	479072114	7654941055	ENG	1637	036E, 039E, 040E, 1057, 9102	$0.00	The research objective of this award is provide critical experimental data and assessment tools essential for evaluating the integrity of common steel gravity load resisting systems. A combination of system testing and component testing will be used to assess the behavior of these systems as designed today. These experimental results will then be used to advance models for the analysis of such systems under large deformations and to identify critical details that have a major impact on system performance. Cost-effective details that transform performance will be developed and tested at the component level and then incorporated in system tests. At the component level, steel connections will be tested under combined rotation and tension loading, and important details of the slab on deck system, such as lap splices, beam anchorage, and the tensile behavior of the slabs on metal decks in orthogonal directions will be tested. System tests will involve large-scale push-down tests of gravity frame systems using current practice details and new concepts developed in this research.<br/><br/>The results of this research will directly impact the safety of almost all steel buildings by assessing the integrity of ubiquitous structural components and developing models for engineers to employ. It will also develop transformative solutions for improving the robustness of common gravity frame components and systems. Through close collaboration with the American Institute of Steel Construction, expedient dissemination and rapid implementation will be facilitated. Graduate students will be directly trained through this research as they address the challenges associated with unanticipated structural loadings. Interest and diversity in engineering will be enhanced through partnerships with the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program at Purdue, the Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP) at Illinois and the Seattle Mathematics Engineering Science and Achievement Program (Seattle MESA) at Washington. These programs will provide for undergraduate (SURF and SROP) and high school (MESA) research internships.
0952497	Collaborative Research: Semantics and Pragmatics of Projective Meaning across Languages	BCS	LINGUISTICS	06/15/2010	06/22/2010	Mandy Simons	PA	Carnegie-Mellon University	Standard Grant	William J. Badecker	11/30/2013	$118,081.00		simons@andrew.cmu.edu	5000 Forbes Avenue	PITTSBURGH	PA	152133815	4122689527	SBE	1311	1311	$0.00	The term projection describes cases where some element of meaning unexpectedly escapes from the scope of another expression, such as a negation or conditional. For example, John didn't see his sister is typically understood as denying that there was an event of John seeing his sister, but not as denying that John has a sister -- even though syntactically the expression his sister is under the scope of the negation. An enormous range of expressions yield projection, including presupposition triggers, conventional implicature triggers, approximatives, and some inferences associated with Gricean implicatures. This project will carry out the first systematic empirical and theoretical analysis of the full range of projective meanings, to establish why projection occurs, and how subclasses of projective meaning differ. To this end, it will develop templates for diagnostic tests that can be used to study properties of projective meanings cross-linguistically, with theoretically naive consultants. The researchers will conduct detailed investigations of projective meanings in English and Paraguayan Guarani, and disseminate the techniques to fieldworkers studying other languages, through publications and workshops. <br/><br/>Modern linguistic semantics centers around Fregean compositionality, the way in which the meanings of parts are combined to give the meanings of larger expressions. While there has been great progress in compositional semantics, projective meaning does not obey ordinary compositional rules. Until now, there has been no uniform account of why projective meanings behave differently from ordinary content. This project seeks to explain projection, based on the working hypothesis that aspects of meaning project if and only if they are not at-issue. The notion of at-issueness is a pragmatic one, based on what questions are under discussion in a discourse. Thus the project will place a relatively little-studied pragmatic notion at the heart of work on linguistic meaning. A first area where the innovations in the project are of broad significance is in its cross-linguistic focus: a theory of human language cannot be based on one language alone, and the project will apply its empirical techniques cross-linguistically. Beyond linguistic semantics, the issues studied are fundamental to Philosophy of Language, since the work subtly redraws the boundary between Semantics and Pragmatics. Further the project is of practical significance in the field of Natural Language Processing (specifically, the subfield of Computational Semantics). Text processing systems, e.g. computer systems for automatically answering a user's questions, must take account of inferences which arise independently of standard composition. A question answering system which does not take account of what is projected will not be able to identify what the user already knows, and will not be able to identify what question needs to be answered.
0960529	Iterative Models in Figure-Ground Perception: Tests and Challenges	BCS	PERCEPTION, ACTION & COGNITION	06/15/2010	06/12/2010	Mary Peterson	AZ	University of Arizona	Standard Grant	Anne Cleary	05/31/2014	$444,193.00		mapeters@u.arizona.edu	888 N Euclid Ave	Tucson	AZ	857194824	5206266000	SBE	7252		$0.00	Visual perception seems trivially easy. Nevertheless, it has long withstood the attempts of both computer scientists and vision scientists to crack its code, most likely because past theories were based predominantly on conscious vision. In order for perceivers to experience a coherent visual world, perceptual input must be organized into separate objects, or figures. As part of this process, the brain decides where a figure lies with respect to every border between two contiguous regions of space. Consider a vertical border, for instance. The brain decides whether that border is a boundary for a figure lying on the left or the right. When the border is perceived as a boundary of a figure lying on the left, the region on the right seems simply to continue behind the figure at the border; no shape is perceived there. These figure-ground decisions are made outside of conscious awareness. Because of this, it is extremely difficult to investigate the mechanisms that produce figure-ground perception. An important, unanswered, question is whether figure-ground perception is accomplished via fast, feed-forward mechanisms or whether iterative mechanisms involving feedback from higher processing levels are involved. In feed-forward models, the input is processed in successive stages until a coherent percept emerges. In iterative models, feed-forward processing is not sufficient; feedback from higher to lower levels is necessary to create the percept.<br/><br/>Mary Peterson and her colleagues at the University of Arizona have designed visual displays that allow them to investigate this question. One display type is a small symmetric, bounded silhouette lying on a larger ground. Portions of familiar shapes are hidden along the groundside of the silhouette's border; these shapes are not perceived consciously, only the shape of the enclosed silhouette is perceived consciously. (The classic face-vase illusion is an example of this.) Previous experiments have shown that the shape of the hidden object is suppressed when it is not perceived, supporting the view that figure-ground perception results from inhibitory competition between shapes that might be seen on opposite sides of a border; the winner is perceived as the shaped figure, whereas the loser is suppressed and the portion of space where it might have been seen is perceived as a shapeless ground. These displays are designed to isolate competition at the shape processing stage. Dr. Peterson and colleagues will also conduct a series of experiments which test whether suppression can be observed at lower levels where individual parts are represented and at higher levels where shape descriptions (semantics) are represented. According to a feed-forward account, suppression of the losing shape would prevent access to its semantics; hence, no effects should be evident at higher levels. Without feedback, no effects should be evident at lower, part-processing, levels either. An iterative view could account for suppression at lower and/or higher levels by assuming that the outcome of the between-shape competition was relayed to higher and lower levels. Thus the proposed experiments will adjudicate between these competing views of how perception occurs. The researchers will also attempt to identify the processes involved in segregating figures from grounds in crowded real-world scenes. The perception of these more complex displays constitutes a challenge to current iterative models of figure-ground perception. The planned research will provide a foundation for neurophysiological experiments and formal computational models of vision and will contribute to our understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of shape perception.

The model will include both economic and energy/electricity flows. It is anticipated that this model will be a useful tool in energy and environmental policy decisions. Advances in the model will be due to including more interactions with other industries and a disaggregated (i.e. source-specific) power generation sector in the US. The model, if successful, will be an important tool for planners and policy makers.<br/><br/>Bruce K. Hamilton<br/>2/24/10

Curation and maintenance of the existing and growing collection and expansion of the range of sedimentary archives by inclusion of coral samples are the main objectives. Further enhancement will include the generation of basic data by discrete sediment measurements as well as nondestructive scanning methods. Improvement of the digital data management and access with the Digital Sample Curation System and an expanded data mining ability is also a goal. The repository cores form important research materials for deep-sea exploration, geological hazards, marine geology, tectonics, sedimentology, geochemistry, evolution, and paleoclimate. Data from old and new materials in the collection were and will be the source for novel interpretations resulting in hundreds of high-profile and influential articles published during the past decade, in leading journals. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Repository continues to be involved in many educational activities. It participates in Saturday Workshops for Educators where teachers can accrue up to 15 hours of new teacher staff development credits. The Repository hosts many visiting graduate and undergraduate classes and the lab is well suited for class seminars on sediments from acquisition to processing. The plan includes employing undergraduates and high school students in research-oriented positions. The repository and its staff will also continue to be available to educators and the media for opportunities to disseminate science to the general public

Mixing by internal waves is thought to be a primary mechanism governing the overall thermohaline structure of the oceans, and may have significant implications for climate variability. The project promises to reduce the uncertainty in climate prediction associated with the smallest scale physical processes that cannot be explicitly solved by climate models. The project will address three aspects of ocean mixing: near field mixing at internal wave generation sites, mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy transported in the wave field, and far field mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy away from sources. Parameterizations will be based on data-based relations for wave physics, radiation balance theory, and results from process models. In addition to be being based on sound theoretical ideas, the parameterizations will also be based on observational results from the growing data set of microstructure observations.

Often, these programs use experiential approaches to provide students with opportunities to develop technologies that will meet the needs of geographically, culturally and economically diverse customers. This project will provide training and support to faculty who are committed to doing work in this area, but need access to additional resources and a network of people who share a similar vision. The project will develop and offer a workshop to provide faculty with key information and resources to develop, implement, and enhance programs that focus on designing and commercializing breakthrough technologies that address basic human needs and alleviate environmental problems in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. The project addresses several significant needs in this emerging area of engineering education: 1) a mechanism for faculty to share and learn about best practices in educational innovations; 2) a hands-on opportunity to develop curricula and strategies for implementation based on information and feedback from experienced colleagues; and 3) an evaluation of the impact these activities have on teaching and curriculum, including the successes and challenges of implementing educational innovations in the university and in the field.

Selmer groups have <br/>traditionally been an important tool for studying the Mordell-Weil group of <br/>an elliptic curve over a number field. They have also played an important <br/>role in proving special cases of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture <br/>which provides a relationship between arithmetic properties of an elliptic <br/>curve E and the behavior of the Hasse-Weil L-function for E. In recent years, <br/>it has become clear that certain natural generalizations of the Selmer group <br/>should provide similar conjectural relationships to the behavior of much more <br/>general kinds of L-functions. Iwasawa theory provides a framework for studying <br/>these conjectures. In its essence, the idea is to study Selmer groups associated <br/>to a family of representations of the absolute Galois group of a number field. <br/>The formulation of these conjectures in a general setting leads to some <br/>fundamental problems. One problem is to find a simple way to measure how <br/>large the Selmer groups are. Their size should be measured by an element in <br/>a certain ring. But it is difficult to find a way to define that element. One of the <br/>objectives of this project is to tackle that question in two contrasting settings. <br/>In one setting, the ring is rather easy to describe, but is non-commutative. In <br/>the other setting, the ring is commutative, but we know very little about its <br/>actually structure. Another objective of this project is to better understand the <br/>behavior of certain quantities which indirectly reflect the structure of Selmer <br/>groups, especially in the non-commutative setting. These quantities are certain <br/>``multiplicities.'' There are typically an infinite number of these quantities. <br/>Professor Greenberg hopes to show how to determine all of these quantities <br/>from just a finite number of them. <br/><br/><br/>One of the fundamental questions in the theory of numbers is the study<br/>of solutions of an algebraic equation. The difficulty of this question<br/>depends on the degree of the equation and the number of variables. It<br/>has been understood since antiquity how to study this question when the<br/>degree is one or two and the number of variables is also one or two.<br/>However, the question becomes much more subtle when one considers<br/>equations of degree three, even if the number of variables is just two.<br/>A fundamental conjecture concerning this question was formulated in the<br/>1960s by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. Although considerable progress has<br/>been made since then, the conjecture remains unresolved. Such equations<br/>define a class of curves known as elliptic curves. The study of their<br/>properties has proved to be of importance in cryptography - designing codes<br/>for the secure transmission of information. Professor Greenberg intends to<br/>continue his study of Selmer groups which have been a traditional tool in<br/>understanding the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves and in studying<br/>the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. The ultimate goal is to<br/>achieve a deeper understanding of the solutions to the algebraic equations<br/>that define an elliptic curve, and to develop a more general point of view<br/>concerning conjectures analogous to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

However, an important byproduct of lean combustion is NOx (x = 1, 2). While cost-effective technologies have been demonstrated for the remediation of NOx produced at stationary sources, solutions for the aftertreatment of NOx produced by mobile sources including diesel powered vehicles remains a major challenge. One of the most significant aspects is that Platinum-containing catalysts are the most effective catalysts for this operation, and the amount of platinum required makes these catalysts prohibitively expensive. In this proposal which calls for collaboration between PIs Thompson from University of Michigan and Schneider from University of Notre Dame, an industrial partner, General Motors, is added to make it a GOALI proposal as well as a Collaborative one. The intent is to resolve why catalytic activity of about the same magnitude as platinum has been observed with a non-precious metal containing perovskite catalyst originally observed by General Motors scientists, and to determine if rugged, inexpensive catalysts can be demonstrated which could in fact replace platinum. This would be a significant change in our understanding of reactions that are catalyzed by platinum, and on a more practical level, would open up the area of diesel-powered vehicles with the improved efficiencies and reduced GHG emissions expected, as less-expensive catalytic after-treatments or mufflers could be available. The program involves the two universities and the industrial partner at many points of contact and in various phases of the work. Students will benefit from the collaboration and from the contact with industry. In addition the PIs will leverage existing education and outreach programs on the campuses to both interest and educate society about the issue and benefits from success in the project.
0948676	Timing, Rates, Episodicity, and Sediment Provenance of Subduction Accretion: Establishing a Geochronologic Framework for Long-term Accretion in the Franciscan Subduction Complex	EAR	TECTONICS	06/15/2010	06/08/2010	Marty Grove	CA	Stanford University	Standard Grant	David Fountain	05/31/2013	$145,163.00		mjgrove@stanford.edu	3160 Porter Drive	Palo Alto	CA	943041212	6507232300	GEO	1572	0000	$0.00	The Franciscan subduction complex of California is the world's best studied ancient accretionary prism. The extensive, diverse data sets from the Franciscan are critical inputs for models for a very broad range of subduction-related processes, complimenting geophysical and geologic studies of modern subduction zones (which are almost entirely marine) and studies of other ancient on-land subduction complexes. Critically, however, the Franciscan and most other subduction complexes have proven very difficult to date and this severely impedes interpretation of many aspects of their development. The last ten years have seen major advances in several powerful geochronologic techniques that are highly applicable to subduction complex rocks, including U-Pb dating of detrital zircon grains from sandstones, U-Th-He dating of detrital zircons, 40Ar/39Ar dating of micas, and Lu-Hf dating of garnet and lawsonite. This project involves an integrated campaign to apply these methods to already well characterized target units across the full width of the Franciscan complex, to units accreted progressively from Jurassic through Miocene time. This new geochronologic framework will effectively complement a very large body of existing Franciscan work that is compromised by poor age control. The new zircon data will also be highly complementary with other large detrital zircon data set being generated from the Great Valley forearc basin, Klamath Province, Cordilleran foreland basin, etc. Synthesized, these data sets will address such issues as: (1) What was the chronology of accretion in this classic subduction system? What were rates of accretion and how did they vary over time? (2) How did the tectonics and paleogeography of the greater Franciscan-Great Valley-Sierra Nevada subduction system evolve over 165 million years of geologic time? (30 How do rates and episodes of accretion correlate with events in the Sierra Nevada magmatic arc, Great Valley forearc basin, Cordilleran foreland, as well as motions of Pacific basin paleoplates? (4) What were the sediment sources for Franciscan metasedimentary rocks and how did they evolve over time?<br/><br/>Subduction is the geologic process by which one of the Earth's major tectonic plates moves beneath an adjacent plate and eventually descends into the Earth's mantle, over time periods of tens of millions of years. It is one of the most important global processes creating and modifying the Earth's surface. It generates chains of volcanoes, sedimentary basins, mineral deposits, and modifies the structure and composition of the crust and mantle. Subduction-generated volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis are among the most severe natural hazards on Earth. Investigations of subduction processes use two broadly complementary approaches. Modern, active subduction zones are targets for geophysical, drilling, geologic, geochemical, and modeling studies, but lay almost entirely beneath the ocean surface, which severely limits direct observation. Ancient, extinct subduction zones are targets for extensive surface mapping, sampling, and geophysical study. Some ancient subduction zones expose a rock record of time-varying subduction over protracted periods sometimes exceeding 100 million years. The goal of this project is to provide a greatly improved framework of the ages of various rock subunits within the well-studied ancient Franciscan subduction zone in California. This improved geochronologic framework will allow much more robust interpretations of many other existing data sets from this subduction zone.

The instrument is expected to catalyze new approaches for conducting research via synergistic amalgamation of heterogeneous supercomputing and cyber-enabled tools that enhance ease of use. In particular, it should allow end users to:<br/>- Make commonplace the ability to perform in-situ visualization for rapid visual information synthesis and analysis, and<br/>- Control their level of immersion in the discovery process from being immersed (a la 'human in the loop' intuitively making real-time decisions via a large-scale gigapixel display), to observing the instrument automatically collect, organize, and analyze data of visual analytics.<br/>Recent trends have exposed the CPU as a 'jack of all computing trades, master of none,' thus giving rise to heterogeneous computing instruments with multiple types of brains (e.g., CPUs and GPUs). Though conventional wisdom believed in 2007 that missing genes in 699 microbial genomes was computationally infeasible, the PI led a team of more than twenty interdisciplinary researchers from eight institutions around the world and developed software cybertool instruments to integrate a set of distributed supercomputing with more that twelve thousand CPUs to complete the task in ten weeks. Coupled with the existing cybertools and those available from NVIDIA the instrument should enable completion of the task in a day with only two researchers. HokieSpeed will have 8,192 CPU cores and at least 61,440 GPU cores in 40 square feet and deliver 35 times better peak performance, 70 times better power efficiency, and 14 times better space efficiency than the current system at the institution (circa 2003) while offering versatility by enabling discovery through a large-scale gigapixel display and appropriately varying degrees of interaction between human and machine. Creating new forms of social research, and 'what if' scenarios for evaluation and promising to deliver research advances across multiple disciplines, the results will be generated often in real time allowing immediate in-situ visualization on a gigapixel display.<br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>Reaching a broad community, the instrument is expected to herald a new age in multi-purpose and interdisciplinary computing instrumentation creating a computational ecosystem that simplifies access and use of the instrument to the masses. Students, including females and underrepresented minorities, will learn about energy-efficient computing, and visualization and interaction at large scale. Among others, the project will also utilize programs that specifically service broader impacts: MAOP (Multicultural/Minority Academic Opportunities Program), CTech2 (Computers and Technology at VaTech), and CRA-W's CREU (Collaborative Research Experience for Undergraduates). Additionally, it will extend an experimental GPU course and offer a workshop version for on-line instruction. Other activities include K-12 outreach, and delivery by CREU of information technology (IT) to rural and economically disadvantaged areas via virtual computing and the VaTech-STEM K-12 Outreach Initiative.

Mascharak of the University of California Santa Cruz in studying metal nitrosyl complexes as exogenous NO donors that are activated with light. Such photoactive nitrosyl complexes are employed to deliver NO to chemical, biological and cellular targets on demand. Density functional theory (DFT) and TD-DFT calculations are used in the smart design of metal (Fe, Mn, and Ru) nitrosyls. These computational techniques are used to fine tune the ligand design so that the complexes are sensitive to near infrared light (which is better for photodynamic therapy). The nitrosyl-dye conjugates are used as trackable NO donors in tracing NO delivery in cellular targets (malignant sites) and monitoring NO-induced apoptosis (programmed cell death). In order to make the various nitrosyls suitable for site-specific delivery of NO, the group incorporates the metal complexes into different polymer matrices. <br/><br/>Nitric oxide (NO) is recognized as a key mediator in a variety of physiological and pathological pathways such as blood pressure regulation, immune response, neurotransmission, and cellular apoptosis. Typical systemic NO drugs (such as glyceryl trinitrate) cannot be used for site-specific NO delivery because of the inexorability of NO release from NO donors. The drug goes everywhere in the body and NO is released via various enzymatic and non-enzymatic (such as pH and temperature) pathways. Light, on the other hand, can control NO release from proper NO donors in a cellular environment. This research project provides insight into the design and synthesis of metal complexes that release NO in response to specific stimuli (light). This goal-oriented project provides an excellent opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in research at the interface of chemistry and biology.
0952120	Collaborative Proposal; Environment, Society, and Economy: Modeling New Behaviors Emerging from Coupling Physical Coastal Processes and Coastal Economies	EAR	DECISION RISK & MANAGEMENT SCI, GEOMORPHOLOGY & LAND USE DYNAM, ENV., SOCIETY AND THE ECONOMY	07/01/2010	06/24/2010	Dylan McNamara	NC	University of North Carolina at Wilmington	Standard Grant	Richard Yuretich	06/30/2014	$100,060.00		mcnamarad@uncw.edu	601 South College Road	Wilmington	NC	284033201	9109623167	GEO	1321, 7458, 7962	7962	$0.00	Human activities increasingly influence landscape change in many environments, both directly through construction and agricultural activities and indirectly through changes to the natural processes that shape landscapes. In turn, the processes that shape landscapes affect humans, often posing natural hazards. In coastal environments these two-way interactions involve coastal erosion, which threatens coastal communities, and shoreline-stabilization efforts, which affect the evolution of the surrounding coastline. Previous numerical modeling has shown that localized shoreline stabilization efforts, such as nourishing beaches by adding sand, can alter shoreline erosion rates even in distant parts of a coastline. Thus, a coastal community that chooses to stabilize its shoreline inadvertently affects other communities, so that the economies and management of coastal communities are linked. This research will use numerical modeling to address the kinds of coupled environmental and economic patterns that emerge under different decision-making regimes. An economic component to the numerical modeling, based on an empirical relationship between property values and beach width, determines the beach replenishment strategy that optimizes the net benefits to an individual community. Coupling this model to a coastline-change model reveals the unexpected ways that communities unwittingly interact with one another, and the feedbacks that induce some communities to shoulder more of the shoreline stabilization effort than others. In contrast, a different economic-model approach will analyze what pattern of beach replenishment would maximize the net benefits of a stretch of coastline more holistically. This project will investigate the different patterns of coastline change and economic benefits these approaches would produce under different scenarios for: 1) sea-level rise; 2) changing storm climate; 3) coastline physical and economic attributes; and 4) diminishing common-pool sand resources and the associated increase in the price of beach replenishment. <br/><br/>Changes in coastal environments can no longer be understood by considering either physical or economic processes in isolation; this research provides a necessary step toward understanding the dynamics of developed coastlines?what causes the patterns of shoreline erosion and economic impacts under various possible futures (given uncertainties in climate change and economic driving factors including sand resources). The results of computer-model experiments testing how coordinated planning for shoreline stabilization could increase net wealth will not only increase basic knowledge about how coupled human/landscape systems work, but it could lead to improvements in coastal management strategies.

In enzymatic biofuel cells, traditional fuel cell catalysts (e.g. Pt, Pd, Ru) are replaced by fuel oxidizing enzymes (e.g. Glucose Oxidase,<br/>Alcohol Dehydrogenase, Fructose Dehydrogenase) at the anode and oxygen reducing enzymes (e.g. Laccase, Bilirubin Oxidase) at the cathode. Currently the main limitations of enzymatic biofuel cells are low power output and limited lifetimes. Principal Investigators David Schmidtke and Daniel Glatzhofer at the University of Oklahoma, Norman Campus have hypothesized on the limiting factors. In enzymatic biofuel cells, the redox center of most enzymes is buried in the protein shell and electrically inaccessible. Thus most redox enzymes do not normally exchange electrons with an electrode. They propose to increase the power output of enzymatic biofuel cells by synthesizing redox polymers that increase the rate of electron transfer (i.e. current flow)between the redox enzymes and electrodes. These novel PEI-based redox polymers produce high currents by efficiently collecting and shuttling electrons between the enzyme°¶s redox center and the electrode surface. These polymers contain metal species, ferrocene compounds, linked to the polymer. Tuning the system will require synthesis of polymers with different lengths of spacer arms. The PIs are targeting a 20-200 fold improvement in power output. <br/><br/>Enzymatic biofuel cells will not solve the nation°¶s energy needs. However, as the demand for portable energy increases, there develops a need for alternative renewable energy sources. Enzymatic biofuel cells are an attractive energy conversion technology because they operate at mild temperatures of20-40?aC and under neutral pH and consume substrates such as sugars that are readily available in biological systems. Because of their inherent selectivities, enzyme based anodes and cathodes can operate in the same compartment without separating membranes thereby reducing size and weight. They have potential applications for both in vivo (e.g. pacemakers, implantable sensors) and ex vivo (e.g. remote site sensing, mobile electronics) systems. <br/><br/>The investigators intend to use their research as a vehicle to increase the attractiveness of the field to potential students. Their belief, based on studies, is that a student°¶s attitude toward science and his achievement in science improves with hands-on experiences. To help increase the likelihood that students will continue their studies in science and engineering, proposed educational activities with research opportunities include Research Opportunities for Undergraduate students and Summer Research Internships for Underrepresented Groups, matched with Research Opportunities for Middle School Teachers.

Because high rainfall is expected during the El Nino conditions forecasted for 2009-2010, burned ecosystems will show their greatest responses this year and afford an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of fire on terrestrial and stream ecosystems. Measurements will be made of short-term changes in burned and unburned watersheds, comparing the influence of fires on a variety of ecological and environmental responses including: stream discharge and the export of sediment and nutrients, soil movement and landslides, re-growth of vegetation at the watershed-scale using high resolution remote sensing and at the transect-scale by direct measurements of re-sprouting plants, and stream biota and ecosystem processes. <br/><br/> Modeling will permit prediction of flooding, soil movements, and stream water quality across a range of climatic conditions during post-fire periods. This information will be of value to natural resource managers and public safety officials. Participation in public meetings will further disseminate the findings. In addition, three graduate and four undergraduate students will gain invaluable experience in watershed ecology, hydrology and management.

The availability of protein function annotations supports the everyday work of biologists in multiple areas---from biomedical discovery to the study of plant drought resistance, and the design of bacteria useful in biofuel production. Assigning function to proteins in sequenced genomes is a major undertaking, and with new organisms being sequenced daily, experimentally determining the function of all the proteins in those organisms is not practical, requiring computational assignment of function to proteins that have not been studied in the lab. Computational scientists have been considering the problem of function prediction for over two decades. Yet, the basic methodology for protein function prediction has not changed much during this time and remains that of annotation transfer from proteins with a known function using a method for sequence comparison such as BLAST. Protein function prediction has several properties that make it difficult to apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods to this problem, such as the large number of potential functions (thousands of possible terms), the fact that proteins can have multiple functions, and the hierarchical relationship between terms in the Gene Ontology (GO), which is the standard system of keywords used to describe protein function. In this work the problem of annotating proteins with GO terms will be explicitly modeled as a hierarchical classification problem using the methodology of kernel methods for structured outputs, which allows the modeling of complex prediction problems. This methodology will allow the PIs to integrate a variety of genomic information - sequence data, gene expression, protein-protein interactions, and information mined from the biological literature. The award will lead to a function prediction method with state-of-the-art accuracy. The project will have broad impact by providing the GOstruct method to the bioinformatics and biology communities in the form of downloadable software and an online-accessible function prediction server. Education will be impacted through the incorporation of the tool into new courses in programming for biologists and on kernel methods.

Two-to-three times in the summer of 2010, a stratified random sample of 18-24 Oregon citizens will deliberate on an initiative for 5 days, then prepare a one-page statement that goes into the official Voters' Pamphlet distributed to each registered voter by the Oregon Secretary of State. This research is the first opportunity to assess the impact of a small deliberative group (i.e., the CIR panels) on a large-scale electoral process. In doing so, this project will address two questions. <br/><br/>First, the research assesses whether the CIR process maintains its design integrity and leads its citizen panelists to engage in high-quality deliberation that yields a well-informed and reasoned Pamphlet statement. To address this question, the project's research team assesses the CIR itself: its overall design and the soundness of its deliberation and judgments. This involves creating and analyzing transcripts of the CIR panel meetings, as well as archival records of the CIR planning process.<br/><br/>Second, the investigators explore whether the CIR's statement in the Voters' Pamphlet has a substantial electoral impact: whether it changes how people choose to vote and the reasons they give for the voting choices they make. The bulk of this project's budget will measure electoral impact through a panel survey of likely Oregon voters, with the first wave occurring before the first CIR panel convenes and the second coming at the end of the election. The design and content of the survey will make it possible to discern the degree to which Oregon voters read or otherwise learned about the CIR statements in the Voters' Pamphlet and whether those statements influenced their vote directly or by shaping their perceptions of relevant pro-and-con arguments or factual disputes. <br/><br/>This research will help practitioners improve the ballot initiative process.
1007149	Periodic orbits of Hamiltonian systems and symplectic topology of coisotropic submanifolds	DMS	GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS	07/01/2010	06/18/2010	Viktor Ginzburg	CA	University of California-Santa Cruz	Standard Grant	Christopher W. Stark	06/30/2014	$203,643.00		ginzburg@ucsc.edu	1156 High Street	Santa Cruz	CA	950641077	8314595278	MPS	1265		$0.00	Abstract<br/><br/>Award: DMS-1007149<br/>Principal Investigator: Viktor Ginzburg<br/><br/>The present proposal focuses on several projects closely related to the PI's previous work. The first group of problems addressed concerns generalizations of the Conley conjecture. Thisconjecture asserts the existence of infinitely many periodic points of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a symplectically aspherical, closed manifold. The Conley conjecture has been established by Hingston (for tori), the PI and eventually generalized to all symplectic manifolds with zero Chern class. However, many aspects of the problem require further investigation. The PI outlines an approach to the proof of the Conley conjecture for manifolds with large minimal Chern class and to some classes of symplectomorphisms and Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms with too many fixed points. A refinement of the almost existence theorem for periodic orbits of Hamiltonian systems and an investigation of periodic orbits of twisted geodesic flows, closely related to the Conley conjecture, are also considered in the proposal. The second part of the proposal focuses on symplectic topological properties of coisotropic submanifolds. These properties generalize the Lagrangian intersection property and the Liouville and Maslov class rigidity to a certain class of coisotropic submanifolds, the so-called stable submanifolds. Moreover, a general picture has emerged, enabling one to treat such facts as non-existence of exact Lagrangian embeddings and the existence of closed characteristics on a contact type hypersurface as particular cases of one phenomenon. The main goal of the program started by the PI and continued in the proposal is to further analyze this picture and to extend coisotropic rigidity results to a broader class of submanifolds.<br/><br/>Hamiltonian dynamical systems describe many classes of physical processes in which dissipative forces can be neglected. For example, planetary motion in celestial mechanics and some electro- or magneto-dynamical processes can be, and usually are, treated as Hamiltonian dynamical systems. One of the classical subjects lying at the very core of modern theory of Hamiltonian dynamical systems and symplectic geometry is the study of periodic orbits (i.e., cyclic motions). Periodic orbits are ubiquitous: a vast majority of Hamiltonian systems have periodic orbits and the number of distinct periodic orbits is infinite for a broad class of systems. The analysis of this phenomenon, building on the PI's recent work, is among the main objectives of the proposed research. For instance, the PI proposes to show that Hamiltonian systems of a certain type have infinitely many periodic orbits. The class of dynamical systems in question includes those describing the motion of a charge in a magnetic field and the proposed research has potential applications to physics and mathematical aspects of mechanics.

Although there have been experimental investigations of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) melting, there are very few field-based studies of natural examples; existing work has focused largely on the age and chemical characteristics of granitoid bodies that are associated with UHP terrains and not on migmatites that commonly host UHP rocks. The generation of large amounts of partially molten crust during subduction has implications for mass and heat transfer from the mantle to the crust, orogenic growth by the addition of partially molten material generated at depth, and evolution of orogenic landscapes (e.g. development of plateaux). Moreover, the role of partially molten crust must be considered in understanding the mechanisms by which (U)HP rocks are overprinted during exhumation and subsequent orogenic processes. <br/><br/>This proposed Early Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is designed to obtain U/Pb zircon ages from magma bodies (leucosomes, pegmatites) spatially associated with eclogite to determine if zircon crystallized and thus melting occurred at UHP conditions. If this exploratory study is successful, it will set up the background canvas for a larger scale project with the ultimate goal of testing the hypothesis that, in some orogens, partial melting of continental crust occurs during continental subduction and is dynamically linked to the thermal-mechanical evolution of orogens and the exhumation of UHP rocks. The pursuit for adequate sample material will take place in the Western Gneiss Region (Norway) because it is an accessible locale with abundant exposure of UHP rocks that are hosted by migmatite; some eclogite bodies are themselves migmatitic.

The following two important open problems in mathematical fluid mechanics will be investigated. The first is the regularity of solutions to the incompressible fluid equations with initial velocity in critical Sobolev and Besov spaces. The second is the behavior of solutions to the fluid equations with initial vorticity in the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation. We will also study the approximation of inviscid fluids by fluids of very small viscosity in these two settings. While much of this research will address two-dimensional flows, extensions of two-dimensional results to the three-dimensional axisymmetric setting will also be considered. <br/><br/>Low viscosity fluids and fluids in which viscosity is negligible are of great interest to scientists and engineers. A goal of this research project is to better understand how well an inviscid fluid must behave in order to be reasonably approximated by fluids of small viscosity. Moreover, this project aims to study the assumptions necessary on both viscous and inviscid flows to extend two-dimensional analysis to a more complicated three-dimensional setting where the flow is symmetric about an axis. Any improvement in the understanding of these two areas of fluid mechanics will lead to more accurate numerical simulations of badly behaved fluids.

Based on recent fieldwork in 2009, the co-PIs have identified more than two-dozen PISL signers, including women and deaf tribal members, from among the Northern Cheyenne, Crow, Blackfeet, Assiniboine, and Mandan-Hidatsa. This demonstrates that PISL continues to be used within Plains tribal groups and still functions as an intertribal signed lingua franca. Formal linguistic documentation and description of PISL has been long overdue, and this workshop will present the latest findings and insights about the linguistic nature and structure of PISL, the outcomes of signed language-spoken language contact, and the conveyance of human language in signed and spoken modalities. <br/><br/>The workshop will be held on the Northern Cheyenne reservation, August 2010; and, will involve participants from several tribal groups and colleges. In collaboration with personnel from Montana State University, Billings, Little Bighorn National Monument, and Dull Knife Memorial College, it will be widely publicized and it is anticipated that more PISL signers will be identified. The workshop will showcase and disseminate recent findings about PISL usage, lexicon, and grammar. For the first time, it will bring together sign language linguists and Deaf and American Indian individuals to train them in linguistics, field methods, and language documentation technologies (e.g. ELAN). Working with Native signers, the co-PIs are transcribing/glossing and translating PISL using ELAN; identifying lexical-grammatical categories; and, conducting comparative syntactic analyses. These findings will be submitted to peer-reviewed linguistic research journals, contribute to the compilation of a PISL dictionary with grammatical descriptions, and integrated into the project website/online digital archive of American Indian sign language documentary materials, so that the broadest possible audiences will have access to them.

In ant colonies, for example, individual ants cannot capture rich spatial information from their environment because of their limited sensing ability. Nevertheless, when the ants coordinate their activities within a colony, the group ends up exhibiting better sensing abilities. Using signal processing and communications techniques, the research studies how and why such manifestations of rational and organized behavior arise at the group level from local interactions among agents with limited abilities, what communication topologies enable such behavior, and what type of signal processing enables such formations. <br/><br/>This research seeks to understand and reverse-engineer the distributed intelligence encountered in socio-economic-biological networks, by investigating relations with learning and rationality over cognitive networks. The latter are adaptive networks that avoid centralized information processing and perform in-network inference and control decisions. Cognitive networks contrast with networks that rely on centralized and parallel information fusion, which are not scalable, are hard to adapt to changing topologies, and suffer from points of vulnerability and information bottlenecks. The research considers large scale networks of agents and studies how global (rational or irrational) patterns of behavior emerge, including herds, contagions and bubbles in economics. An understanding of how the biotic environment influences collective behavior in animal societies provides a real world guide to good cognitive networks, which can be used in turn to design engineered systems. Cognitive networks have applications in areas ranging from precision agriculture, to environmental monitoring, disaster relief management, and smart spaces.

The nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) and its vector generalization are universal asymptotic models for quasi-monochromatic waves in nonlinear media. Both NLS and vector NLS are completely integrable and can therefore be solved by the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) method. However, this method for vector NLS in the normal dispersion regime (defocusing regime) is not yet fully developed. Hence, the complete development of this method and description of the soliton interactions is a principal part of the project. The coupled Maxwell-Bloch system, which arises as a model in atomic physics, laser physics and optics, will also be investigated by a suitable adaptation of the IST method. Further, the IST method will be extended to the recently derived short-pulse equation, which provides a more appropriate model than the quasi-monochromatic approximation. Theoretical development of the IST for these systems and elucidation of the soliton dynamics will be guided by numerical simulation and direct methods for constructing special solutions.<br/><br/>Because of their physical applicability in such diverse fields as water waves, magnetic spin waves, optical fibers, waveguides and Bose-Einstein condensates, NLS and other systems investigated in this project are of wide scientific relevance. Dynamics of their solitary wave (soliton) solutions is also of keen interest from the point of view of applications, as interaction of vector solitons sets forth the experimental foundations for designing controlled logic gates and all-optical computers, of the phenomenon of self-induced transparency, as well as a mechanism for polarization switching of light in multi-level media. The equations investigated in this project are not only models for phenomena at the frontier of physical science, but also have intrinsic mathematical value. <br/>The development of a modern IST for these equations will advance the fundamental understanding of complex physical phenomena in a unified mathematical framework and provide concrete information about the behavior of such systems. The collaborative nature of the research program, both between the principal investigators and with colleagues at nearby institutions, will serve to accelerate the development of an interconnected research community accessible to students at Montclair State and at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (both undergraduate institutions). Significantly, the student population at both institutions includes a substantial number of members of underrepresented groups and the collaboration leverages existing programs directed to these students

Despite intensive research into aggressive signaling, the means by which most animals assess their own status and that of competitors during contests remains unclear: for example, animals may use mutual assessment, in which persistence in a contest is based on assessing their fighting ability relative to that of their opponent, or they may use self-assessment, in which the decision to withdraw is based only on assessing their own accumulated costs, regardless of characteristics of their opponent. Recent theoretical work has provided a method to distinguish between possible means of assessment. This study will use these recent theoretical advances to determine whether male gray treefrogs, Hyla versicolor, use mutual or self assessment during aggressive vocal interactions. Measurements of the duration and level of escalation of staged aggressive encounters between calling males in size-equal and size-unequal pairings will be used to distinguish between these two possibilities. Under mutual assessment, contests are expected to be longer when individuals are more closely matched, regardless of their absolute size, while self-assessment predicts that contest duration is an increasing function of the absolute size of the smaller individual, regardless of size asymmetry.<br/><br/>This experiment will provide important new information on the significance of aggressive signaling that will be important for confirming the results of recent theoretical work. It will also continue the development of H. versicolor as a model for studies of aggressive signaling. Aggressive calling in frogs has been understudied in general, yet frogs offer many advantages to the study of communication. Finally, this project will provide important research experiences for several undergraduate students (including those from underrepresented groups), who will be given the opportunity to participate fully in the project's execution.

It will support travel for USA based speakers, graduate students, postdocs, and other USA based participants. Approximately 20 USA based participants are expected, including about 10 graduate students and postdocs, to attend the three day seminar. <br/><br/>The WCOAS is a 20 year tradition among the operator algebraists in western North America. Its intellectual merits include: providing an opportunity for researchers to disseminate their own results; furnishing an opportunity for researchers to learn about recent research of others and to stay abreast of current work; fostering collaborative research by giving researchers the opportunity to meet and discuss their work with one another. Among the broader impacts of WCOAS are the encouragement and nurturing of graduate students and postdocs by giving them the opportunity to present their own work, learn about recent work, and meet established researchers in operator algebras; creation and maintenance of a cohesive regional community of operator algebraists; and the fostering of connections between the faculty and students at research universities and those at primarily undergraduate institutions. Moreover, this WCOAS will help develop ties between mathematicians in Mexico and the rest of North America.

The workshop will be held at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) headquarters in Washington, D.C. in September 2010 and will be under the direction of Dr. Suzanne G. Brainard. <br/><br/>Women faculty of all ethnicities continue to be exceedingly underrepresented in STEM fields, with many U.S. university STEM departments having no minority women on their faculty at all. As an emerging, well-funded area of research that cuts across STEM disciplines, NT/NS provides an opportunity to (1) assess the representation of women in this emerging field and (2) investigate the various factors that influenced the educational and career pathways of different groups of women from a variety of STEM fields into the cutting-edge and cross-disciplinary area of NT/NS. The CWD proposes to organize and conduct a workshop to bring together social scientists, scientists and engineers to discuss the obstacles these women scientists and engineers face, to develop recommendations for effective strategies to recruit and advance women into STEM faculty in nanotechnology, and to develop a network of women faculty in nanotechology to encourage cross-institutional collaboration.

Cell division itself is mediated by contractile proteins, whose assembly is controlled by the signaling protein Rho. The mitotic apparatus, which sorts the chromosomes, is based on microtubules, and somehow provides the spatial information to pattern Rho activity, and hence contractile protein assembly, in space and time. A long-standing hypothesis proposes that molecular motors carry signals along microtubules of the mitotic apparatus to tell the cell surface where to contract. This project will directly test this hypothesis by investigating the quantitative conditions under which motors of the kinesin family can translate the information immanent within the rapidly-changing microtubule array into a pattern of Rho signaling at the cell surface. To do this, the investigators will create hybrids between motor proteins and photoactivatable fluorescent proteins and measure their biochemical properties. They will measure motor motility parameters by observing single motors attaching to and moving along single microtubules in vitro. These same hybrid motor probes will be introduced into cells, and live imaging will be used to measure their dynamic behavior during cell division at high resolution. Meanwhile, advanced 3D computer simulations will be developed to predict how these same quantified agents should behave in the context of the whole cell, either normally or when the geometry of the microtubule array is experimentally altered; in turn, assays in live cells will test these predictions. By combining live-cell imaging, single-molecule measurement, and computer simulation of hypothetical outcomes, the project will produce an account of the physically-plausible conditions under which the cell's toolkit of molecular motors and cytoskeletal assembly regulators could add up to a mechanism for robust spatial pattern formation during cell division. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/><br/>This project will train undergraduate and graduate students in high-resolution live-cell microscopy. The research also involves development of a sophisticated agent-based computer simulation program that is expected to have broad application to many other fundamental problems in cell biology, beyond the specific research goals of this project. This software and computer code will be made freely available to other researchers. Likewise, the research is expected to produce several useful molecular probes that will facilitate broader studies of the behavior of the cytoskeleton by other researchers. These probes will be distributed freely to researchers using Addgene.org, a non-profit plasmid repository which makes constructs available for the cost of shipping. Finally, this research will generate, as by-products of the specific experiments conducted, numerous microscope images and videos which the investigators will make freely available via both lab websites and public collections for educational and other research use.

Garrison	07/31/2011	$44,284.00		kimmeld@ecu.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	Greenville	NC	278584353	2523289540	GEO	1650	0000, 4444, 5987, 7914, OTHR	$0.00	On April 22, 2010, the drill platform Deepwater Horizon sank in nearly 1,200 m of water in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Since this date various estimates of oil and added chemical dispersants have been released from the site with dispersion both at the surface and at depth. The transport of this oil and dispersants has been influenced by wind-driven currents over the shelf and by the Loop Current and its derivatives offshore. To date the exact amount and paths of movement of the Horizon spill remain speculative. Since 2003, with NOAA-CSCOR funding, this group of investigators has conducted 5 summer cruises in the northern Gulf of Mexico that used high-resolution sampling to define the spatially explicit relationships between physical structure to pelagic zooplankton and fish distributions.  Thus this group has one of the most comprehensive, synoptic data sets on temperature, salinity, oxygen, phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish in the northern Gulf of Mexico for conditions prior to the oil leak.<br/><br/>The current RAPID award will allow this group to repeat their high-resolution mapping of hydrography, oxygen, plankton and fish in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The domain of interest will include the previous survey region in the hypoxic zone west of the Mississippi Delta but also the area east of the Mississippi where more oil transport from the spill has been suggested. The cruise will take place in the late summer period because the investigators have 5 years of ?baseline? data during this season to compare the results. The measures of species diversity and abundance, biomass size spectrum, fish diets, fish growth rate potential and ecosystem models will all be extremely useful to assess the possible effects of the oil spill on the living resources of the northern Gulf of Mexico. In addition to the rapid mapping cruise on the inner to mid-shelf, this group also will send scientists on the ORV Oceanus to conduct high resolution vertical zooplankton measurements (LOPC and TAPS) and MOCNESS zooplankton tows at deeper stations and broader mapping surveys to extend our spatial coverage of the affected area. They will coordinate our zooplankton and fish measurements with other investigators assessing the biogeochemical and biological impacts of the BP oil spill. Data from previous NOAA will be deposited in the BCODMO data management facility as well as current measurements and model products.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Given the economic importance of the Gulf of Mexico commercial fisheries (about 20% of the U.S. total landings representing about $991 million) and recreational fishing (generating ~30% of the nation?s saltwater fishing expenditures and supporting nearly 25% of the nation?s recreational saltwater jobs), it is imperative that knowledge of the effects of the BP oil spill on the pelagic ecosystem be assessed. The Horn Point Laboratory and Oregon State University are part of the National Science Foundation ? Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (NSF-COSEE) and Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs. Where possible in this NSF RAPID response grant, we will involve REU undergraduate students and teachers in our proposed research program.

It enables the development of a new<br/>analytical tool for the detection of dioxins which are environmental contaminants that arise from combustion of organic materials in the presence of chlorine. Dioxins build up in human tissues, causing long-term health problems including cancer, diabetes, endometriosis and others. The toxicity of many isomers is unknown, as it is difficult to selectively identify many isomeric forms of dioxins. Current analytical methods involve mass spectrometry (MS), or tandem-MS techniques. However, the former cannot identify individual isomers, while the latter lacks sufficient sensitivity to reach low detection limits. <br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to potentially impact the $6 billion worldwide market for mass spectrometers, of which the investigators expect to capture 1 percent, or $60 million.  In addition, differentiation of isomeric forms with high sensitivity in a compact form-factor would be a new and welcome capability in multiple scientific fields, including air pollution monitoring, toxicology, and exposure assessment.

With MMC, the current mobile phones are no longer the traditional mobile phones with only voice and/or video phone functionalities. More features, such as multimedia streaming and mobile P2P applications, are integrated into these small devices. The grand challenge in MMC mobile phones is making a good tradeoff between performance and power. Different from existing hardware-oriented approaches, such as clock gating and power gating for high performance and low power design, this research proposes software-oriented approaches such as power-aware parallelization of mobile applications and power-aware task scheduling to meet this challenge.<br/><br/>In this 2-year EAGER project, the PI is seeking answers to this foundational performance/power tradeoff problem. The prposal sets forth four ambitious objectives to do so: 1) To build a performance and power tradeoff model for mobile multicore platforms considering user requirements; 2) To parallelize mobile applications for mobile multicore platforms with memory, timing, and power constraints; 3) To schedule multitasks for multicore platforms with memory, timing, and power constraints; and 4) To develop a prototype mobile system based on mobile multicore computing platforms with high performance and low power consumption. It is expected that the insights and results drawn from this project will benefit researchers, practitioners, users, and students on a large scale.

In the context of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that occurred in the northern Gulf of Mexico in April, 2010, it is natural to focus attention on the potential for storms in this region to transport and deposit some portion of the pollutant oil inland.  As of June 10, 2010, a conservative estimate of the surface slick in the Gulf is 45,000 square kilometers.  While attention is currently focused overwhelmingly on impacts in the open marine and coastal environments, little -- if any -- attention has been given to examining the potential for tropical storms and hurricanes to move oil spill contaminants far inland.<br/><br/>With funding through this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) researchers at East Carolina University will take a first look at the conveyance of components of the Deepwater Horizon to short-range and longer-range inland sites via the sea storm - rainfall route.  Post-storm rainfall samples will be collected at one coastal site (Lake Pontchartrain) and at one or more inland sites for analysis for aliphatic hydrocarbon (finger-printed to the material from the oil spill) and carbon isotopic composition.  This will be the first study of its kind.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Besides the obvious relevance to advancing our understanding of the near- and far-field environmental and human health impacts of the Deepwater Horizon spill, this simple study will also inform scientists, environmental managers, and policy makers working dealing with similar environmental catastrophes in the future and at other places.  A first-year female graduate student will also participate in this project.

One barrier to the formation of new species is subsequent hybridization of differentiated individuals. The goal of this study is to examine the processes in nature that contribute to barriers of hybridization, including both barriers that prevent hybrids from being formed (pre-mating isolation) and the causes of poor hybrid performance in the field (post-mating isolation). The work will be conducted on two closely-related plant taxa in the genus Clarkia that are in the very early stages of speciation, providing a unique opportunity to understand evolutionary processes in action that cause species formation. The proposed project uses large manipulative experiments in the field and the genotyping of DNA markers in the laboratory to examine hybridization and its consequences. <br/><br/>This research provides important insight into the origin of earth's biodiversity, which is critical for understanding how species will respond to climate change and what will be required to conserve them. Much more is currently understood about the relationships (systematics) of species and how they differ at the genetic level than the ecological processes that caused them to diverge from one another. Finally, funding will be used to train post-doctoral and undergraduate scientists in both genetic and ecological research.

Moreover, what accounts for local variation in implementation of social policy in China? Through an analysis of rural health delivery in China, this project will address the larger issue of welfare state performance in non-democratic developing countries, which comprise half of the world's people and nations. Despite the significance of this issue, the dominant research paradigms ignore or misrepresent authoritarian systems and instead focus on the impacts of democratic forces, such as civil society and electoral competition.<br/><br/>Another gap in the current literature limits its utility for policy analysis in the quest for good governance. Much policy analysis of welfare regimes in developing countries is overly focused on policy adoption at the national level. In reality, all regime types have to grapple with the difficulties inherent to the geographic and regional diversity that produces the complex realities of local communities. Without understanding variation within a country, an analyst cannot fully grasp the causes driving policy successes and failures. This research begins to fill in these glaring lacunae.<br/><br/>To this end, the dissertation will examine the adoption and variation in implementation of the New Cooperative Medical System (NCMS) in rural China. Building on the existing literature, this project will evaluate three broad categories of hypotheses: political and historical context, economic constraints, and social forces. The extant literature on the welfare state in developing countries examines the first two sets of hypotheses at the national level; this research will test whether these factors affect variation in implementation of the NCMS at the local level in China. As for the effect of social forces, the current literature typically emphasizes the role of democracy and democratization; this project will examine whether and how social forces affect the adoption and implementation of social policy in an authoritarian context. To test these theories empirically, the dissertation will rely on qualitative research, including archival research; semi-structured interviews with government officials, medical personnel, and villagers; and the analysis of an original survey of county-level Public Health officials in five provinces.<br/><br/>In addition, this dissertation will have concrete broader impacts through the dissemination of an original survey and the presentation of results in China and other developing countries. First, the original survey will be archived for public use. Second, the co-investigator will collaborate with Chinese partners and present the results of her research in Chinese at Chinese universities. Third, the dissertation has policy implications for social policy in developing countries and will include a comparative chapter on social policy in other developing countries. Thus, the results will have implications for both academic debates and policymakers concerned with social welfare provision in China and beyond.

As such, the workshop will provide a forum for the much needed interaction between control theory and various cross-disciplinary application areas, resulting in a cross-polination of ideas and providing an impetus for interdisciplinary collaborations.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/><br/>The proposed workshop will encourage a broad and diverse group of students to pursue research careers, by providing them with an opportunity to closely interact with leading researchers in the field in an intimate setting. Moreover, the unique opportunity to get to know and interact with program managers will be invaluable for these students and postdocs as they transition into independent junior researchers over the next few years.

Due to their large scale deployment, these systems pose very different requirements, compared with traditional real-time systems. They generally require soft (predictable) real-time delivery over multiple domains on dynamic networks. These requirements cannot be met using current overprovision or reservation-based solutions. This project investigates a promising solution to effectively address this issue across multiple domains. <br/>The fundamental issues in supporting large-scale predictable real-time delivery on the Internet, by addressing the predictability in the network layer are studies here. In particular, the project explores the ready-available time synchronization technology, such as GPS, CDMA, and IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol, to achieve predictable delivery over multiple domains and dynamic paths. Two key mechanisms are developed to estimate the delay from a router to a destination and service a packet based on its upstream earliness and downstream laxness for more efficient resource sharing among partially-overlapping flows.<br/>The results from this project will provide a viable practical solution to support large-scale distribution control systems and enable more powerful applications in power control, traffic monitoring, and energy management. The research results will be shared with the broad community via journal and conference publications. A prototype system will be built to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. This project will work with Native Hawaiian Science and Engineering Mentorship Program to broaden the participation of minority students.
1001768	p-adic local Langlands and Iwasawa theory	DMS	ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM	07/01/2010	06/17/2010	Robert Pollack	MA	Trustees of Boston University	Standard Grant	Andrew D. Pollington	06/30/2014	$200,388.00		rpollack@math.bu.edu	881 COMMONWEALTH AVE	BOSTON	MA	022151300	6173534365	MPS	1264		$0.00	Over the last decade, the Iwasawa theory of non-ordinary modular forms of weight 2 has seen a surge of results which has brought the theory more on par with the well-established ordinary case. However, in weights greater than 2, little is known in the non-ordinary case about even the most fundamental questions on Selmer groups and L-values.<br/>The most serious obstacles to progress along these lines are (1) the wild behavior of non-ordinary p-adic L-functions, and (2) the complicated nature of the local conditions at p which arise. To circumvent the first of these obstacles, Pollack seeks to make a systematic study of the Iwasawa theory of non-ordinary modular forms at each finite level of the cyclotomic Zp-extension. To deal with the local obstacle, he aims to use the p-adic local Langlands correspondence to control the local structures which arise, and to then formulate an algebraic theory of theta-elements which is the analogue of the analytically defined Mazur-Tate elements. Pollack aims to prove a series of theorems which show that these algebraically defined elements control the size and structure of Selmer groups, and to show that the main conjecture is equivalent to the equality of these elements with Mazur-Tate elements. One particular goal of this program is to combine results of Kato and the theory of algebraic theta-elements to prove a conjecture of Mazur and Tate which asserts that their analytic theta-element lies in the Fitting ideal of a certain dual Selmer group.<br/><br/>The motivation for the study of this project comes from the theory of elliptic curves which are certain mathematical objects whose points have the shape of a doughnut. Elliptic curves, once the focus of study of only pure mathematicians, have now become ubiquitous in both the theory and practice of cryptography. Further, as a result of the breakthrough proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in the mid 90s, we now know that elliptic curves are intimately connected to modular forms which are functions of a complex variable with many many symmetries. Wiles' theorem essentially states that one can make a precise dictionary between elliptic curves over the rational numbers (which are geometric objects) and certain modular forms of weight 2 (which are calculus-type objects). This project pushes out beyond the case of weight 2 modular forms, and seeks to make a systematic study of certain properties of arbitrary weight modular forms. It remains to be seen if these higher weight modular forms (which can be thought of as generalized elliptic curves) are also highly important from a cryptographic viewpoint.

The systems studied will include up to three flavors of fermions and two additional pseudo-spin degrees of freedom. Problems germane to relativistic particle physics and nanoelectronic devices such as graphene and carbon nanotubes will be investigated. To realize a system described by the Dirac equation, fermionic Li-6 atoms will be confined in a three dimensional optical lattice with a honeycomb structure in two-dimensions. For a honeycomb lattice at half-filling (the situation realized in intrinsic graphene), low-energy excitations have a linear dispersion relation and can be formally described by a massless Dirac equation where the speed of light c is replaced by the Fermi velocity vF . The pseudo-spin degree of freedom corresponding to the four-component Dirac spinor is associated with the two interleaving triangular sub-lattices A and B which comprise the honeycomb lattice. A method for adding an adjustable mass term in the Dirac equation by producing an inequality between the A and B sublattices will be implemented. <br/><br/>The investigations of transport (including the role that interactions play) and mechanisms for opening a bandgap in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice will aid in the development of nanoelectronic devices based on graphene such as ultra-high speed transistors and novel electron optics devices. Study of Klein tunneling and the opening of a bandgap due to interactions will respectively provide insight into fundamental questions regarding the electrical breakdown of the QED vacuum and chiral symmetry breaking and mass generation in QCD. Furthermore, the observation of a color superconducting phase will guide our understanding of the state of high-density nuclear matter. In carrying out this research, undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained in the use of modern technology, analytical thinking, scientific writing and giving clear oral presentations. This research program will continue to recruit students from demographic groups underrepresented in the sciences.

These revolutionary VCSELs will operate in a single mode with high output power, narrow linewidth and stable linear polarization for use in spectroscopy and communications. In this approach, both semiconductor distributed bragg reflectors (DBRs) of the VCSEL are mostly eliminated. On one side, a high-contrast subwavelength grating (HCG) mirror is used for single-mode linearly polarized output. On the other side, the high reflector is replaced with a dielectric DBR. Using this combination, it is possible to build efficient single mode VCSELs at any wavelength covering near-infrared and approaching mid infrared (800nm to 2,500nm). High efficiency and high output power are achieved by very low electrical resistance and efficient heat sinking. The first prototype will have an emission wavelength of 1550nm with the ambitious goal of offering a preferred alternative to DFB lasers in long-haul fiber optic communications and near infrared spectroscopy. HCG fabrication and a complete design followed by epitaxial growth will be done in Phase I.<br/><br/>The Broader Impacts / Commercial Potential of this project range from telecommunications to spectroscory. The developed devices will have the mode purity and linewidth of DFB lasers and the beam quality and low cost of a VCSEL at any near infrared wavelength with stable linearly polarized output. Immediate application areas are in telecommunications and spectroscopy. Of particular interest in communication systems are the reduction of cost per bit, and power consumption per bit of transmitted data. Implementing the proposed VCSELs in fiber optic transceiver units results in reduced cost and reduced power consumption over existing edge emitter based solutions. Reducing power consumption in turn leads to miniaturization and high density assembly that lead to further cost reduction. Up to now, long wavelength 1550nm VCSELs have not had the required characteristics to gain widespread use. Particularly challenging requirements for VCSELs to meet are high optical output power and narrow linewidth for long haul transmission. The proposed approach makes possible for these VCSELs to meet all the requirements and to potentially become an attractive alternative to edge emitting DFB lasers. The lack of wavelength constraints makes these sources ideal for overtone spectroscopy in the near infrared for environmental and security applications.

Studies have shown that many bugs are cloned (i.e., copied-and-pasted) to many places. Unfortunately, existing error detection tools have not provided programmers the ability to efficiently search for bug clones. Thus, they have to resort to ad hoc manual approaches such as grepping the source tree for bug clones.<br/><br/>This project aims to improve software reliability and integrity through automatic detection and repair of bug clones given a newly discovered vulnerability. It will investigate a new dimension, code similarity, for detecting software bugs. Specifically, it will investigate the feasibility of an approach that derives bug seeds from a new bug patch or existing static or dynamic error detection tools, searches a large code base (potentially across administrative domains) for bug clones, and automatically protects the bug clones. This approach can detect bugs in cases where many existing techniques cannot due to code complexity: detecting similarity between code is easier than deconstructing its meaning.<br/><br/>If successful, this project will result in accurate tools that will help to detect and repair software vulnerabilities early. Programmers will use these tools to detect and repair bug clones whenever applicable. Improvements in the reliability and security of software on which business, government, and individuals depend on will positively impact society. This project will provide a more reliable and robust computing infrastructure resilient to new threats and attacks. Integrating the proposed research into the CS curriculum will as promote reliability and security awareness.

Many applications flow from and contribute to the more computational and combinatorial aspects of algebraic geometry, and this often involves subtle real-number or positivity properties. This project will further the development of applications of algebraic geometry by supporting PI Sottile's work in applications of algebraic geometry and its application-friendly realms of real, combinatorial, and computational algebraic geometry. This include convex algebraic geometry, toric varieties in geometric modeling, quantum Schubert calculus in linear systems theory, tropical geometry, and continued investigation of the Shapiro conjecture. It will also further the growth of applications of algebraic geometry by supporting Sottile's activities as an officer within SIAM and organizer of scientific meetings, and by supporting Sottile's training and mentoring of graduate students, postdocs, and junior collaborators.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry, which is concerned with geometric properties of solutions to algebraic equations, is giving rise to new tools for use in the applications of mathematics. This has been recognised by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics through their creation of an activity group on algebraic geometry. This proposal will support the further development of these new tools for applications from algebraic geometry through the support of research, training, and organizational activities of PI Sottile.

Sediment microbial mediated processes are capable of oxidizing oil and methane in the environment. The PI's will examine the impacts of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (hereafter BP spill) on microbially mediated processes in the deep waters and sediments in the vicinity of the spill site. This is an unprecedented oil spill and it is essential to obtain a clear understanding of its impacts on microbial processes in the waters and sediments of the Gulf of Mexico. The work will complement several funded or planned geochemical and microbiological sampling programs focused on the oil spill response. They will evaluate rates of water column methane oxidation and sediment sulfate reduction and methanogenesis at multiple sites around the spill site. Additional experiments will quantify the impact of nutrients, oxygen and substrate concentrations on these important microbially mediated processes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This work will clarify the response of microbial processes in deep waters and sediments to the Deepwater Horizon spill. The project will support a post doctoral associate (female, Hispanic) and an undergraduate student (female, African American). The proposed work is leveraged by NOAA funding which will permit us to expand the number of study sites and number of sampling cruises. A web site will be developed to highlight our work and convey our results to the others in the scientific community as well as to the public.

Working with colleagues in the UK, the PI will generate and correlate high-resolution stable isotope and paleo-magnetic intensity records along a proximal to distal transect from the mouth of the Labrador Sea across the belt of detritus left by ancient ice-rafting events in the North Atlantic. The project will document millennial-scale variability in ice-rafting, ocean circulation, and geomagnetic properties with the goal of addressing important questions about the evolution of the Earth's climate during a critical period of transition (the mid-Pleistocene transition) and mechanisms for abrupt climate change. In addition, the results will provide a stratigraphic framework for the broader scientific community studying climate change in the North Atlantic. Further broader impacts of this work include international partnership and student exchange with NERC-funded UK scientists.

This process is intended to address the shortcomings in: (i) Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis, that is part of gasification of non-food feedstocks to create syngas, where expensive catalysts are needed and the products have non-ideal distribution; and (ii) grain-ethanol processes for gasoline replacement, which are faced with feedstock limitations (i.e. edible carbohydrates) and entail difficult, energy-intensive product-water separations. This project seeks to demonstrate a process with syngas and dilute ethanol as co-reactants that will use lower-cost catalysts and milder process conditions than F-T to deliver superior fuel products relative to ethanol. The work plan includes synthesis of new catalysis, their assessment under an expanded range of operating conditions and modeling of process economics. Demonstration and practical integration of these process advantages are targeted. <br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project begins with a beneficial offering to current ethanol manufacturers in a retrofit scenario. Implemented as a bolt-on, the process can potentially increase biofuel volumetric production and fuel energy output by two fold or more. If successful, lower feedstock costs and reduced energy needs will dramatically improve economics while reducing the negative impacts of corn and energy price fluctuations. This technology has the potential to increase alternative fuel capacity from the current ~11B gpy to ~20B gpy, while delivering a more energy-dense fuel. The process promises to reduce fuel prices (due to lower feedstock costs, lower energy costs, and transportation savings related to pipeline distribution), and to cut greenhouse gas emissions by >50%. Fully implemented at existing bio-refineries, the technology could also reduce annual natural gas consumption by an estimated 256,000,000 MMBTUs (~$1B) and displace an incremental 178MM barrel of crude oil each year. This project has the potential to deliver a breakthrough approach sought by recent federal legislation (2007 EISA) with its mandate for 21B gpy of advanced alternative fuels to be available by 2022.

For example, recent analysis of a family of cavefishes from the southeastern U.S. suggests that a surface-dwelling fish with functional eyes has evolved from a blind, cave-dwelling ancestor. The alternative is that an ancestor with functional eyes repeatedly gave rise to separate blind cavefish species. To test these hypotheses, this study examines genes involved in eye development. The alternative hypotheses make distinct predictions about similarities and differences between species with regard to molecular changes in eye-related genes in blind versus sighted lineages. However, the differences may be subtle and examining a multiple-gene dataset will provide the power needed to test the predictions of Dollo's Law versus reverse evolution. This study demonstrates a way forward when other analyses suggest, but cannot confirm, that reevolution of complex structures is likely.<br/><br/>This study will provide insight into the molecular evolution of several eye- and pigment-related genes in a vertebrate and might aid understanding of visual dysfunctions in humans. In addition, discoveries from this research will be incorporated into ongoing education and outreach efforts to local schools and organizations. Educational activities will confront common misconceptions about use and disuse in evolution, and promote understanding of how genes and environments jointly affect traits.

Over the last 10 years since it was first invented, about 40 academic laboratories have begun using the technique to study problems ranging from electron transfer in solar-cell materials to protein folding. The aim of this proposal is to combine advances in laser technology with advances in mid-IR pulse shaping to construct a 2D IR spectrometer that is robust, automated, and technologically more advanced than currently existing technologies.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be three-fold. First, it will enhance scientific understanding across a wide range of disciplines because of the unique time and structure sensitivity of 2D IR spectroscopy as compared to other techniques. Second, our results will be disseminated at academic and trade conferences, which will impact the broader scientific and industrial communities. Third, the commercial impact of this instrument in this proposal will be substantial. Infrared spectrometers are used routinely in academic and industrial research labs throughout the world. A commercial 2D IR spectrometer would enable higher sensitivities and more accurate analytical measurements than possible with current infrared spectrometers, thereby contributing to advances in pharmaceutical agents, energy storage materials, and many other products.

By bringing novel experimental capabilities to directly measure nanoscale variations in the electronic properties of model organic semiconductor films and study at the microscopic level how heterogeneity arising from variations in processing parameters leads to variations in performance. This project will address unique new challenges including:<br/>1) Studying the evolution of local current distributions as a function of processing-induced disorder in charge transport in organic semiconductors;<br/>2) Obtaining local information about vertical film structure to construct a picture of 3D morphology in photovoltaic blends using local scanning probes.<br/>3) Using time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy to study trapping, de-trapping, and photochemical degradation kinetics on sub-100 microsecond, and sub-100 nm scales to probe correlations between nanoscale film structures and trapping in organic semiconductor films.<br/>These objectives are of fundamental scientific importance to the field of organic semiconductors and address basic description of transport processes in these systems: if 1D models are insufficient, what is the most physical yet efficient way for 3D models to include +the requisite spatial disorder? How are the disorder parameters in theory linked to experimental processing conditions and observables? While the morphology/performance relationship in organics is widely recognized as a central challenge that affects the field from theory to synthesis to manufacturing, most methods of characterizing morphology permit only a correlation of average performance with average local structure and thus overlook the important role of local heterogeneity. This proposal will help transform the understanding and use of organic semiconductors.<br/><br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance, and is expected to provide unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate training in an interdisciplinary field. This research project is also expected to have broader impacts through the training of scientists in this research field, through the wide dissemination of the findings of this research through publications. <br/>The proposed research program will take place at the intersection of chemistry, physics, and materials science, and has technological applications in the areas of photovoltaics, energy efficient displays, and lighting. This proposal will support established educational programs including ongoing recruitment of under-represented groups into scientific careers, public outreach to K- 12 students, and broader interactions with the local community. The project will create new undergraduate research projects, international collaborations, and new industrial educational experiences and partnerships.

The investigator has already shown that Teichmueller space is an infinite polyhedron with an infinite number of vertices and geodesic faces meeting at right angles. The description gives a short proof of the Masur-Wolf result determining the full symmetry group of the polyhedron. The investigator has provided detailed information on the geometry near the faces. Lengths of closed geodesics (shortest closed paths) on a hyperbolic surface are parameters for locating a point in Teichmueller space. The investigator will continue his program of using analysis of variations of the lengths to describe the synthetic and differential geometry of Teichmueller space. The description is simpler than the investigator's prior approach, which is presently used by a number of researchers. The investigator is developing a description of curvature in terms of variations of lengths. The investigator will also study harmonic (least total square energy) mappings to and from the infinite polyhedron. He will also continue to study the Weil-Petersson geodesic dynamical system, as well as intersection theory for the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.<br/><br/><br/>A Riemann surface is a two-dimensional surface with a notion of angle measure at each point. A Riemann surface with at least two handles is endowed with non Euclidean (hyperbolic) geometry determining distance, shortest paths and a vibrating membrane operator. Riemann surfaces come in various shapes, described by the relative locations of thick and thin subregions. Teichmueller space is the space of all possible shapes for a Riemann surface with a given number of handles. The hyperbolic geometry of individual Riemann surfaces leads to the Weil-Petersson geometry for Teichmueller space. Riemann surfaces provide models for vibrating membranes, propagating particles and fractals.

POMT will be designed to accompany and supplement high school science curricula, and improve students' conceptions of the scale and structures of microscopic phenomena. The Phase I version of the application will teach basic biology concepts focusing on genetics. Research objectives include (1) developing accurate 3D biological content, (2) designing effective gameplay and interactivity mechanisms, and (3) ensuring the commercial and educational viability of the application. The project will employ an iterative design process that revolves around input from freshman and sophomore high school students in Seattle, WA. Evaluation will include formative and summative components. In the formative evaluation, the researchers will monitor the appeal, value, and usability of the POMT application. Summative evaluation of the application will determine its efficacy for teaching students about the scale and function of biological structures in genetics. The resulting technology is expected to foster students' understanding and excitement for STEM subject matter through engagement with a versatile, one-of-a- kind, commercial-quality application suitable for 21st century education. <br/><br/>Currently, there is a critical market opportunity for educational content creators to begin designing high-quality game-based learning tools for K-12 Public Schools. Powers of Minus Ten (POMT) will be a multipurpose educational application that has the ability to contextualize a wide range of scientific visualizations across orders of magnitude, with demonstrated STEM educational value for Biology instruction. Most scientific discoveries relate to scales so far distant from the human experience that they are inconceivable to students and the general population. POMT will give the user the ability to scale from the human level down to the nanoscale, investigating the 3D structures and functions of the natural world. The broader impacts of this research include (1) the scalability of the software to encompass topics in other subject areas, (2) the creation of new educational methodologies that couple the use of the latest interactive technology and handheld devices with traditional lectures and assignments, and (3) the ability to facilitate a sophisticated understanding of scale - an understanding that is not only a prerequisite for the next generation of scientists to remain competitive on the world stage, but one that can aid in the establishment of a scientifically-literate populace.

Lake Shore Drive,	Chicago	IL	606113008	3125037955	SBE	1332	1332	$0.00	Project Description<br/><br/><br/> This workshop on Cognitive Bias and Forensic Science brings together about two dozen leading psychologists, forensic scientists and others to explore the ways in which psychological factors may affect the conclusions that forensic scientists reach. It will be held on Sept. 23-24, 2010 at the Searle Center at Northwestern Law School in Chicago, IL. The workshop will begin with a series of background presentations. These presentations will explore the methods used in the forensic sciences, the roles that various psychological factors may play in forensic pattern recognition, and review portions of a recent National Academy of Sciences report on the current state of the forensic sciences. In the afternoon of the first workshop day, participants will break into small groups to discuss ways in which judgmental bias may affect what forensic scientists see, the actions that they take, and their final judgments about who or what is the source of evidentiary items recovered from an investigation. The sources of bias discussed will include such diverse sources as the nature of a forensic task, the environment in which the forensic judgment is made, pre-existing expectations of the forensic scientist, emotional biases, and biased decision-making strategies (e.g., looking for evidence to confirm an idea rather than looking for evidence to disconfirm it). Groups will be encouraged to convert general theories and testable hypotheses into concrete research proposals that advance our understanding of social and cognitive effects on judgment and decision making with an eye toward using that new understanding to identify potential areas for reform in the forensic sciences. <br/><br/>On the second day of the workshop, each group will present their ideas to the complete set of workshop participants. Time will be left for discussion to refine those ideas. The workshop will end with a session designed to pull together workshop contributions and to identify a concrete agenda for further research. <br/><br/>The intellectual merits of this workshop include the possibility of developing theories and empirical projects that advance our understanding of bias and error in human forensic judgment. Current evidence suggests that cognitive and contextual factors do affect forensic judgment, but such research is in its infancy. By bringing together a diverse group of participants, this workshop will encourage a process of cross-fertilization wherein the forensic researchers think about new ways to employ behavioral theories and findings in their future work, and the psychologists think about using the forensic sciences as a platform for their social and cognitive research. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The broader impact of the workshop also stems from the synergy that will result from bringing together personnel in disciplines that have much in common but ordinarily have little to do with one another. If this workshop leads to improvements in the training of forensic scientists and the output of their analyses, the criminal justice system will benefit from the corresponding increase the accuracy of forensic science testimony and evidence presented at trial. Similarly, the forensic sciences may reap benefits by becoming more intertwined with mainstream science and scientific institutions.

The goal is to establish the feasibility of sensors that permit the selective measurement of free and complexed cyanide in the cyanide leach reactor, detoxification reactor, and in the tailings facilities. The sensors are ideally suited for these measurements since they are expected to be unaffected by turbidity, to have a cyanide selectivity that can be tuned with specific receptors, and to require no off-stream sample handling. The project will take advantage of highly selective and fouling-resistant fluorous perfluoropolymer membranes. <br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project, if successful, is significant, as it is expected to reduce the enviromental harm resulting from the mining industry's mineral recovery. Specifically, the research aims to significantly reduce the amount of toxic cyanide use. More effective control of cyanide usage is expected to minimize accidental cyanide discharges significantly and thereby, reduce resulting negative impact on the environment.

The recent discovery of subsurface oil plumes in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) at mesopelagic (200-1000 m) depths brings the threat of oil exposure to a critical link in the open ocean trophic pyramid: the pelagic deep-sea community. Petroleum hydrocarbons have been identified at depths of 400 and 1000 m in the northern GOM. Extensive use of dispersants and a very deep well-head raise the likelihood of a substantial interaction between the mesopelagic community and petroleum hydrocarbons originating at the Deepwater Horizon well site. Until now, the deep pelagic ecosystem has remained largely free of oil-derived pollution and its inhabitants are likely to be very sensitive to it. <br/><br/>The mesopelagic micronekton/macrozooplankton assemblage of the GOM is both highly diverse and vertically mobile. The great majority of the fish and crustacean species reside at depths below 600 m during the day, performing a migration into the upper 250 m at night. Thus, chances of mid-water species encountering subsurface oil plumes are extraordinarily high. Briefly put, if the plumes are present, a large fraction of the mid-water community will be migrating through them.<br/><br/>This research project will: (1) obtain data on present-day micronekton species composition, distribution, and abundance in the upper 1000 m of the water column using ships of opportunity, and compare those data with those acquired in previous decades; (2) evaluate the degree to which the community has already been exposed to subsurface oil plumes using GCMS analysis of hydrocarbon fractions in organismal tissues, and comparing those results with previously collected specimens maintained at -80o; (3) evaluate the variability in sources of carbon and nitrogen supporting mesopelagic biomass and determine the trophic position of present day and previously collected specimens using d13C and d15N of muscle tissue. The data collected in this project will provide a stable isotope baseline allowing for evaluation of present and future subsurface oil impact. <br/><br/>Broader impacts. Broader impacts include training a postdoctoral fellow in shipboard sampling, the biology of mesopelagic fauna, and basic geochemical methodologies and data interpretation. The PIs have established regular interactions with TV and newspaper reporters have been on the forefront of the shipboard sampling and geochemical analyses that first described the subsurface plumes emanating from the oil spill. Interaction with print and visual media will continue throughout the study as the oil spill coverage continues.

Johnson <br/>IOS-1021917<br/>HAP2(GCS1): Mechanisms of double fertilization<br/><br/>The molecular mechanisms that allow gamete cells (sperm and egg) to fuse are unknown. Overcoming this gap in our knowledge is an important goal because gamete fusion is central to the life cycle of all sexually reproducing organisms. Flowering plants (including major crops like corn, rice, and soybean) undergo double fertilization: one sperm fuses with the egg cell to form an embryo and another sperm fuses with the central cell to produce endosperm, a specialized tissue that supports the embryo. These cell fusion events lead to formation of seeds, the basis of the human food system. Gaining greater understanding of gamete fusion in flowering plants will lead to technologies that can improve seed crop production and control reproduction of crop plants. The hap2-1 mutant was identified using genetic analysis in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. hap2-1 mutant sperm appear normal, but fail to fuse with either the egg or the central cell. These mutants lack a protein, HAP2(GCS1), that is normally on the surface of sperm cells. The hypothesis that will be tested in this project is that the HAP2(GCS1) protein is directly involved in a process that allows the male and female gametes to fuse. The goals of this project are 1) to identify new proteins that participate with HAP2(GCS1) to mediate gamete fusion, 2) to identify proteins that regulate the function of HAP2(GCS1), and 3) to determine how HAP2(GCS1) and other proteins allow gamete cells to fuse. The results of this project will have broad scientific impacts because HAP2(GCS1) is found in many eukaryotic species and is likely part of a gamete fusion mechanism employed by many plants and animals. This project will provide cutting-edge research training for both female and male undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral researchers of diverse backgrounds. This project also includes an outreach component to local elementary and high school students and teachers.

Bio-electrochemical systems have received significant attention in recent years with the discovery of electricigen microbes capable of transferring electrons to and from electrodes at high rates. To date, most research has focused on using these processes in fuel-cell-like devices to produce electricity or hydrogen. In this project, IntAct will build and demonstrate a simplified process for enhanced anaerobic digestion based on adding electrodes and applying voltage directly into an AD chamber. The resulting proprietary system makes use of an applied voltage to modulate the growth of electricigen microbes on electrodes thus overcoming thermodynamic limitations to methane production and enabling pH control.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be the ability to recover increased amounts of energy from the wastewater treatment process.

Several examples are: solitary water waves at the water / air interface, aerodynamic shock waves and optical beams or pulses used in communication networks. This research concerns the study of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) governing wave phenomena, in particular coherent structures, in optics, electromagnetics, hydrodynamics and quantum physics. Coherent structure solutions of PDEs often arise due to a combination of nonlinear and dispersive effects. Nonlinearity tends to concentrate energy and dispersion tends to spread it out; their balance often results in persistent or long-lived coherent structures. We will study the dynamics of coherent structures - their stability and scattering interactions. We shall also consider the interaction of such coherent structures with spatially inhomogeneous media. Inhomogeneities (spatially varying coefficients in the PDEs) introduce another class of localized states called defect modes. We will study the nonlinear dynamics and energy exchange between coherent structures with defect modes and radiation modes. Finally, we will apply our previous work on energy transfer between discrete (bound state) and continuum (radiation) modes in energy conserving PDEs to the question of control of wave propagation, e.g. designing a photonic structure to maximize the lifetime of a designated optical state. Our mathematical approaches range from rigorous analytical methods to formal asymptotic methods to numerical simulation of PDEs and optimization.<br/><br/>Advances in the design and fabrication of micro- and nano-structured media are driving mathematical research to determine their effective properties and those of waves propagating in such structures. Such microstructures are important components in current and future communication and information processing technologies. For example, they enable the manipulation of light (photons) in a manner analogous to the way electricity (electrons) has been manipulated in solid state computer chips for many years. Advantages come through greater speed and virtually dissipation free propagation in photonic media. Due to the size, multi-scale character and complexity of these problems, relying on full computer simulations of the governing partial differential equations is not practical for the problem of device design. The mathematical problems explored in this project are aimed at the development of systematic approaches to characterization of such microstructured media and an understanding the properties of waves traveling through them. These will be used to develop hybrid analytical / computational approaches to the problems requiring the control of coherent structures.

Math machines are simple physical devices that give an immediate, dynamic expression to abstract mathematical functions. They focus on brief activities for standard math and science classes rather than large-scale extracurricular projects. They feature precise control rather than dramatic speed, and they use explicit student-designed mathematical functions to achieve physical results. Through this project, math machines are extended to use new computer controls to supplement the original calculator controls.<br/><br/>The project expands nationally to provide each of 40 community college teachers of math and physics with two new math machines. It provides community colleges with the ability to produce their own math machines and to train high school and college faculty in their use. The project produces, tests, revises and disseminates 20 new classroom activities and improves and enhances existing software. The PIs evaluate the impact of math machines on student learning, on student and teacher attitudes, and on the dynamics of interdisciplinary cooperation within and between institutions. Additional features include support for National Instruments interfaces to supplement the current support for Vernier Software and Technology and Texas Instruments calculators.

A team of MSU faculty and students will travel to GASU for workshops addressing similar interests in science learning in informal settings. The team will also meet with community members of two villages (Ongudai & Kosh-Agach) in critical ecological and ethno-cultural areas of the Altai. <br/>The MSU principal investigators are Michael Brody (Education), Cliff Montagne (Ecology) and John Fisher (Archaeology). The GASU coordinator of the workshop is Natalia Yurkova (Education & International Programs). In addition, Eleanor Abrams (Education) from the University of New Hampshire (UNH), representing school-based science learning with indigenous Altai people will participate in the workshops.<br/>The workshops will address informal science learning in an ecological context and focus on issues of culture and diversity as they relate to indigenous populations in contrasting ecological and social systems. Two separate one and a half day workshops in Ongudaisky Region and Kosh-Agachsky Region, Altai Republic will focus on native people?s understanding, values, interests and concerns related to informal learning settings and how these will influence our future research and education activities. <br/>These workshops contribute significantly to our emerging understanding of science learning in informal settings. They address a unique conception of ecological learning in three dimensions; personal, community and cultural perspectives. The inclusion of a school-based perspective merges our understanding of formal and informal science learning in these unique settings. This collaboration provides a holistic view of science learning and will unite diverse intellectual resources and research efforts in unique ecological and social systems.<br/>This work is expected to extend our understanding of science learning related to critical natural and cultural resources and their management. An understanding of how, why and where learning takes place will help extend the US and international research and education agendas related to informal and formal science learning, natural and cultural resource management and social and ecological sustainability.

Due to the extreme depth and broad area of impacted region, it is critical that the presence and structures of oil plumes be determined for accurate mass balance calculations, estimating damage, and understanding the overall chemical/physical behavior of individual hydrocarbons comprising the oil. There exists considerable uncertainty on the presence of subsurface plumes reported by other researchers. The latter is due, in part, because the findings are based on in situ fluorescence typically used to measure dissolved organic matter. In addition, these findings only provide an estimate of total oil. <br/><br/>To provide a robust and higher resolution dataset on the hydrocarbon distribution and structure in the Gulf of Mexico, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will deploy the TETHYS in-situ mass spectrometer. TETHYS compliments conventional sampling by providing near-continuous records and by providing far greater spatial resolution. Additionally, real time feedback from TETHYS can be used to guide conventional sampling. <br/><br/>The TETHYS in-situ mass spectrometer is optimized for long-term unattended environmental monitoring of low molecular weight (2-200 amu) gases and volatile chemicals in a variety of hostile environments. TETHYS is also unique among field-portable or underwater mass spectrometers in that it retains high mass resolution in the low-mass range (1-25 amu), allowing it to quantify hydrogen, helium, and methane. In this study of the Deepwater Horizon spill, TETHYS will be deployed on two different subsea platforms: an enhanced CTD rosette and the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Sentry. <br/><br/>The research team will work collaboratively with a number of other investigators from Woods Hole, Texas A & M University, and the University of California at Santa Barbara who have separately received RAPID funding to study various aspects of this historic oil spill. All of these investigators have prior experience with the TETHYS/CTD/Sentry technology. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Results from this research are expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of petroleum fate and carbon cycling in the Earth system. Knowledge gained from this research will also be translated and transmitted directly to state and federal agencies involved in the spill damage assessment and restoration. The project will provide the concepts, processes, and parameters necessary for existing industry oil spill models to be adapted to the unparalleled situation of a major oil release on the deep sea floor. The continued expansion of offshore drilling operations into deeper waters may lead inevitably to the risk of more spills in the future.

LiCoO2 is the primary cathode material, but it is relatively expensive, and has safety concerns. A safer alternative is LiMn2O4, but its utilization is limited by a relatively higher fade capacity; i.e. decrease in capacity with repeated cycling. The project will investigate the effects of nanoporous structure of ceramic coatings on the fade capacity of LiMn2O4. Different material composition and firing temperatures of thin-film coatings of titania and zirconia nanoparticles on LiMn2O4 will be studied. Fixed rate cycle tests (1C) will be performed at a temperature of 55C for different coating formulations to determine the number of cycles before the capacity decreases to 80% of the initial value. The best performing formulation will be tested further using both high-rate cycling for at least 200 cycles and progressive rate cycling. This formulation will also be tested on LiCoO2. The goal is to increase the life of the coated cathode material by an order of magnitude as compared to the uncoated material. This project is also expected to provide additional understanding of nanoparticle coating techniques that may be applicable to variety of energy storage applications.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project, if successful, will result in improvements in the cycle life of Li-ion batteries and allow the use of safer materials. Although lithium-ion batteries have gained wide acceptance in consumer electronic products, their use in other markets, particularly transportation applications, has been limited by their lifetimes and safety concerns. Improving the lifetime of the safer materials used in these batteries can enhance Li-ion batteries' penetration into transportation and other large markets, enabling access to a $7 billion end user market. The successful outcome of this project will impact applications where there is a need for enhanced cycle life and thermal stability.

One of the particularly promising aspects of this research is the dynamic behavior of low-dimensional ferroelectric structures with constrained geometry in the external electric field. For the vast majority of applications, it is the switching and the associated evolution of domain structure that is the cornerstone for device functionality. This research will answer questions related to interplay between complex geometry, size and dynamics of polarization reversal in nanoscale ferroelectric structures and the fundamental scaling limits to ferroelectric-based devices, such as high-density non-volatile memory and data storage devices, spin filters and microwave devices. International student exchange is an essential component of the project contributing to the well-coordinated collaborative research between US and European partners. The UK portion of the work is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). Students recruited into this project from underrepresented groups, in particular, are benefiting from exposure to international research through the enrichment of their professional preparation and education experience. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project is investigating and seeking to understand the manner in which reduced size and increased morphological complexity affect the switching behavior of meso- and nanoscale ferroelectrics. The experimental approach involves fabrication of free-standing single-crystalline nanoplates, nanorods and nanodots of a model ferroelectric BaTiO3 and characterization of its dynamic switching behavior by means of an advanced 'stroboscopic' Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (S-PFM) method. The samples are being prepared using a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technique and then structurally characterized at Queen's University Belfast (QUB), UK, in the group of Prof. John Martin Gregg. Prior research has demonstrated that the FIB mode of fabrication gives particularly clear insight into the fundamental behaviour of ferroelectrics at reduced scales. S-PFM is being used to map the dynamics of domain wall motion during in-plane switching, induced by an external electric field applied between coplanar electrodes. FIB-engineered defects in the thin ferroelectric slabs, such as holes, notches and slits, allow direct studies of the manner in which physical defects alter the nucleation and propagation of domain walls. The outcome of the project will lead to fundamental advances in understanding the role of electrical and mechanical boundary conditions and sample scaling on the basic mechanisms of ferroelectric switching.

It is a source of energy estimated to be able to satisfy a tenth to a quarter of the World?s electrical energy needs. More recent developments in the late 20th century have inspired a new generation of wave energy converters (WECs). When ocean waves interact with these devices they produce a motion between two moving parts of the WEC. This relative motion is then use to generate electricity. One of the features to optimize in the design of a WEC is the amplitude of the relative motion which in turn will maximize the harvested energy.<br/><br/>The purpose of the proposed work is to construct, model, analyze, demonstrate, and<br/>improve upon a novel excitation system for WECs. This system is based on the intake and release of water during the motion of the WEC. The timing of the intake and release is governed by the motion of the WEC features an open loop control, and has the potential to increase the electrical power generated by the WEC. The model for the WEC can be considered as a parametrically excited system or a hybrid system. Incorporating the effects of the stochastic ocean wave environment and the fluid-structure interaction are non-trivial. To this end, a team of featuring analysts, mechanicians, and experimentalists from the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the United States Naval Academy will conduct the proposed research. The research features construction and testing of a scaled prototype and has several educational aspects. It is hoped that the research on the novel excitation system will result in more efficient and cost-effective methods to harvest ocean wave energy.

The PI argues that the current understanding of the Norse occupation of Greenland is biased toward large preserved ruins that are easily identified and surveyed because they are readily seen in the landscape. This project will assess the potentially numerous sites that are not so easily seen, perhaps buried under the deep aeolian sands that exist, or even those buried by later human occupation layers. <br/><br/>This project is well proposed as an EAGER, it will support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches. Because of the unknown quality of the hidden Norse record this project is High Risk but with the definite potential for High Return. If the PI is successful in identifying these sites with these techniques, then the project has the potential of creating a deeper history of the Norse in Greenland. This is High Risk but not completely un-proven, the PI and CoPI have been using these techniques to locate sites in Iceland. And although the geology and geography of Greenland is different and thus the need to test this technique, based on the PI and CoPI's record in Iceland, there is a high probability that they will succeed in Greenland.

The majority of power consumption will shift from the processor to main memory. This project, rather than relying solely on DRAM, uses multiple technologies to construct a high-capacity, energy-efficient memory system for virtualized computer servers with a new Storage Class Memory Architecture that incorporates multiple memory technologies such as DRAM, Phase-change memory (PRAM) and Flash.<br/><br/>This project is ambitious with fundamental and applied contributions in the design and development of energy-efficient computer servers. The fundamental contributions include: a new integrated memory architecture that seamlessly manages hybrid memory resources; novel algorithms and policies for energy, performance and endurance management; better understanding of the hypervisor?s role in resource management and its interaction with upper and lower system layers; and a new hybrid DRAM and PRAM main memory controller. The applied contribution is in the form of tools that will be developed and disseminate, including simulations, analytic models and actual software/emulated hardware system. <br/><br/>This research represents a new green computing technology that satisfies the demands of future computing systems (e.g., cloud computing, server farms, commodity computers) in an exceptionally low energy manner. The project impacts undergraduate and graduate students through research opportunities and industry internships and aims to recruit people from under-represented groups in computer science and computer engineering.

This Gordon Conference will provide an opportunity for graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, academicians, and industrial and national laboratory researchers to congregate and discuss cutting edge technology and current research trends and to share mutual experiences while building informal networks with peers that may lead to a lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement. <br/><br/>Over the past 10-15 years, there has been tremendous activity and interest in membrane science and technology, driven largely by advances in our ability to control and analyze complex structures at the nanoscale. Additionally, critical societal needs in the areas of energy, water, bioprocessing, and the environment are providing exciting new opportunities for membrane technologies. These include the development of new membrane for hydrogen/oxygen, direct methanol, and alkaline fuel cells, membrane separations for the purification of ethanol produced from cellulosic biomass, and membrane systems for carbon dioxide removal from gas streams. The Gordon Research Conference on membranes will have specific sessions on contemporary topics dealing with energy production and storage, membrane technologies for energy efficiency, nanomanufacturing, and membranes for water purification. The discussions between the speakers and audience will provide valuable feedback on current research efforts and will enable the participants to further develop and refine new ideas for their own research and/or to initiate new membrane projects. <br/><br/>Gordon Research Conferences provide a setting where researchers can present their most recent and, at times, most controversial results. The conferences also foster informal discussions and networking that occur outside of the formal lecture sessions. Such interactions promote the generation of new ideas and new collaborations that assist in moving forward the field of membrane science.

Anderson	06/30/2011	$48,433.00	David Schmidt	ray@uoregon.edu	5219 UNIVERSITY OF OREGON	Eugene	OR	974035219	5413465131	GEO	017F	017F, 7914	$0.00	This project will characterize the next slow slip earthquake on the Cascadia Subduction zone interface using uplift measured by a dense network of tide gauges. 12 temporary tide gauges are being deployed on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, the portion of the Cascadia subduction zone expected to experience a M ~6.5 slow slip earthquake in ~August of 2010. Because the recurrence interval of slow slip on this part of the subduction zone is ~14 months and the ocean is an order of magnitude quieter during the summer, the ~August 2010 event provides an opportunity to catch an event at the calmest time of year that will not recur for at least 7 years. Data from this temporary network and the existing sparse NOAA network of tide gauges are providing a detailed image of the vertical deformation associated with the 2010 event, which is poorly resolved by GPS or seismic techniques that have been used to study the last 12 of these events. The vertical deformation, combined with horizontal deformation from GPS and source location and timing information from seismology, allows us to accurately determine the distribution of slip and the release of strain on the subduction interface. This improved understanding of slip on the deep subduction zone interface will provide the necessary data to build better models that link the time-dependent release of strain along the subduction zone, including the timing and extent of rupture of M~9 megathrust earthquakes that occur on average 300-500 years on the Cascadia subduction zone. It has been speculated that a future slow slip earthquake will trigger the next megathrust earthquake and tsunami, so it is critically important to understand these events and how they relate to damaging seismogenic earthquakes.<br/><br/>Undergraduate students from NSF's UCORE program, who are participating in a summer research at the University of Oregon, are carrying out most of the instrument deployments. The UCORE program brings community college students to the University of Oregon to learn to carry out scientific research by actively participating in ongoing projects. The UCORE students are installing and calibrating the tide gauges, downloading and interpreting the data, and will present the results of their work in a formal poster session at the end of the program.<br/><br/>In addition to the primary goal of characterizing the 2010 slow slip earthquake, our deployment allows us to calculate the long-term relative sea level change at each site, because most of our sites have been occupied intermittently over the past century. This means we can compare the long term uplift rate to the uplift associated with individual slow slip earthquakes and thus determine how much of the strain provided by plate tectonics is available for megathrust rupture and permanent landscape development. Finally, our project is allowing us to improve our methodology for finding tectonic transients in tidal records, and potentially to apply this method to generate a catalog of slow slip events that extends back ~100 years in this area.

A novel electrical pumping scheme will be investigated to convert germanium (Ge) from an indirect-bandgap to a pseudo-direct-bandgap material using ultra-high-density free electrons. The objective is to realize strong electroluminescence in the Ge thin film and thus demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating an electrically pumped nano-LED or laser within the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process flow. <br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a fundamental breakthrough in photonics technology that will benefit and possibly even revolutionize the industry that develops and markets communication systems, because it will supply the last missing link ? the light source ? required for true monolithic integration of photonic and electronic circuits on one low-cost Si platform. Extensive applications with potentially enormous markets would be enabled, ranging from chip-to-chip optical relays to long-haul optical communications.
1042845	AToL: Collaborative Research: Phylogeny of Lepidoptera: A Genomics-inspired, Community Collaboration	DEB	ASSEMBLING THE TREE OF LIFE	03/27/2010	06/11/2010	Jerome Regier	MD	University of Maryland College Park	Continuing grant	Robb Brumfield	04/30/2013	$287,068.00		regier@umd.edu	3112 LEE BLDG 7809 Regents Drive	COLLEGE PARK	MD	207425141	3014056269	BIO	7689	7689, 9169, EGCH	$0.00	This collaborative, multi-disciplinary project will exploit recent progress in genomics - the study of the complete genetic content of species and how it works - to greatly advance our knowledge of evolutionary relationships in the insect order Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). A broad-scale family tree (phylogeny, genealogy) will be estimated using DNA sequences from approximately 250 species, representing all 126 families into which Lepidoptera are currently divided. A simultaneous review of known lepidopteran fossils will allow estimation of the geological ages of origin of the major groups. The 24 genes to be sequenced, identified by genome comparisons and screening in an earlier Tree of Life project, constitute far greater sampling of the genome than has heretofore been possible in most insects. Beyond providing a backbone phylogeny, the project is designed to catalyze a world-wide community effort to further resolve the lepidopteran tree, incorporating more traditional evidence from anatomy and behavior in addition to DNA. Annual lab workshops will help other lepidopterists to apply the numerous genes developed for this project, methods for which will be continuously updated on the web. An international network of >20 experts on Lepidoptera will help to choose species and provide specimens for project DNA sequencing. These experts will also jointly produce the first comprehensive catalog of anatomical features potentially informative about lepidopteran family genealogy, clarifying the chaotic terminology which has frustrated previous attempts to employ these traits for tree-building. A central project feature, also borrowed from modern genomics, will be an interactive website allowing the project team plus any other researcher to contribute and download data, methods, analysis and commentary on lepidopteran phylogeny at any level. The intent is to foster global cooperation and progress toward a fully-resolved tree. The web site will be seeded with most of the current evidence, to ensure a critical mass of information for others to build on. The same compilations will be used to greatly augment the available resources for public education on Lepidoptera, through contributions to popular web sites such as the Tree of Life.<br/><br/>The Lepidoptera are the largest single group of plant-feeding insects, numbering over 160,000 species. Ubiquitous and familiar, they are both a vital component of terrestrial ecosystems - what would birds and bats eat without them?- and arguably the most damaging group of pests overall to agriculture. As unusually conspicuous terrestrial non-vertebrates, Lepidoptera are extensively used in ecosystem assessment, and for educating and involving the public in environmental biology. They are also important focal organisms in many areas of biological research. For example, the evolutionary diversification of Lepidoptera in association with the rise of flowering plants, beginning in the Age of Dinosaurs, has figured prominently in the attempt to understand the origins of today's biodiversity. A well- corroborated family tree is essential both for understanding any aspect of lepidopteran evolution, and for constructing classifications that let us effectively organize and apply our voluminous knowledge about individual moth and butterfly species. However, relatively little progress toward such a tree has heretofore been made.

Radiative coupling between plasmons (oscillating free electrons confined to metal surfaces) on arrayed nanotoroids could improve light trapping in photovoltaics more than random nanoparticles or textured back contacts, which have not made solar power cost-competitive. <br/>Intellectual Merit. A novel solution will be developed that considers both near- and far-field interactions to identify nanotoroid radii and spacing that plasmon-enhance electromagnetic fields to maximize photovoltaic light trapping. Nanotoroid lattices fabricated by new methods and measures of far- and near-field enhancements by spectroscopy and electron microscopy will validate the solution. The PI and co-PI recently showed tunable resonances near semiconductor bandgaps, and extraordinary local fields in nanosphere arrays and in nanotoroid pairs, respectively. This motivates combining efforts to overcome three existing shortfalls: (1) low efficiency near photovoltaic bandgaps; (2) few models to design nanoarrays for photovoltaics; and (3) few direct measures of plasmon-enhanced fields coordinated with models.<br/>Broader Impacts. Two underrepresented graduate students will collaborate with researchers at Centers in Semiconductor Physics and Electronics in University of Arkansas, at Texas Instruments, Inc., and in France and Egypt to characterize these nanostructures. New cyberinfrastructure will transmit lab data to offices for real-time analysis. Ultimately, the PIs are working to self-assemble plasmonic nanostructures to transform applications in health, optoelectronics, and sensing, as well as solar energy.

Most of the associations between animals and bacteria are benign and some are beneficial, but under some circumstances, commensal (benign) bacteria convert to pathogens, resulting in diseases such as endocarditis and sepsis. This switch is poorly understood, but may involve changes in host physiology or immune status or bacterial entry into organs where they normally do not reside. The animal gut is a common source of bacteria that undergo the commensal-to-pathogen switch, but the complexity of the microbial communities in many animals' guts presents a barrier to studying the gut community's interactions with the host that lead to the change in health status. The investigators will study the commensal-to-pathogen switch of normal gut residents in a common caterpillar, the larva of the gypsy moth. The project aims to understand the fundamental ecological interactions that enable a bacterium that is a normal member of the gypsy moth gut flora to incite disease and death in the presence of a toxin produced by another bacterium. The study will test the hypotheses that the conversion to pathogen is associated with host's inflammatory response and that the normal microbial community of the gut mediates the commensal-to-pathogen switch. The project will provide the context for providing summer research experiences for undergraduate students from historically black universities. They will be recruited from participating universities in cohorts to provide them a peer group during the research program. All mentors of the summer students will be trained in the course, Entering Mentoring, which was developed by the PI, to ensure a successful research experience for every student.

The research will attempt to answer the questions 1) In what ways do Peruvian welfare policy and programs aimed at economically disadvantaged children reflect international children's rights and free-market ideologies? 2) What strategies do economically disadvantaged children use to negotiate these changes? and 3) In what ways do children's lived experiences differ from how they are constructed and portrayed by policy, government officials, and care workers? Informational interviews with government officials, program staff, NGO directors and police officers, along with analysis of relevant child welfare policy, will provide data on available services and opportunities, requisites to utilize such services, and the ways in which adults invoke children's rights. Extended interviews and participant observation with 15 street children in Lima and 15 street children in Cusco will provide data on children's livelihood strategies and responses to social and economic change, exploring topics related to work, education, and interaction with service-providers. Data will then be compared to examine gaps and disconnects in the ways in which adults construct and portray childhood and the ways children describe and frame their own experiences. The methodology recognizes children as social actors, providing spaces for their participation, rather than just providing glimpses into changing social indicators. The findings will indicate how economically vulnerable children respond to structural constraints in creative ways, as well as explore the ways in which free-market ideology and international children's rights complement and contradict each other in the context of child welfare policy in Peru. The investigators expect to demonstrate that children's actual experiences of social and economic change differ significantly from government officials? and policy makers? Claims and portrayals of child poverty, as children's rights continue to be defined by adults, and are selectively applied. <br/><br/>This research looks at how global ideas relating to free-market ideologies and international children's rights are reworked in specific contexts. It analyzes the ways in which working children in Lima and Cusco respond to, and negotiate, economic and social changes. An understanding of children's livelihood strategies and views of their future will contribute to strengthening policy regarding child labor and education, as well as overall national development within Per˙. In particular, by raising awareness of some of the limitations of current indicators used to measure poverty, this work will contribute to better policy analysis, and in turn, better policies to address issues related to child poverty. It may also impact the literature on international development and children's geographies by considering the ways in which children utilize public spaces as places of work and living. Because child poverty is an issue all countries face, increased communication and awareness of the ways in which both youth and governments respond to such problems can facilitate collaboration to make a concerted effort to improve children's opportunities for future success everywhere. This project is jointly supported by the NSF Geography and Spatial Sciences Program and the Americas Program of the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.

Because participation in the NutNet by researchers around the globe has already vastly exceeded the original expectations, the current grant will fund a coordinator to work with the core network participants to design and implement web-based data and metadata entry forms, ensure network-wide data quality, produce education and outreach products, and plan and execute several network meetings.<br/><br/>The NutNet is a uniquely global effort to gain a general understanding of the extent to which fertilization (e.g. nitrogen or phosphorus runoff, aerial nitrogen deposition) and consumers (e.g. introduced species) control plant communities and ecosystem services in grasslands around the world. While studies addressing parts of this goal have been conducted at many of the individual sites in our network, highly coordinated cross-site studies, such as the NutNet, are lacking. The NutNet also provides an innovative networking environment that promotes global research collaborations which will advance our ability to predict ecosystem responses in the face of enormous global changes. In addition, the NutNet also serves to foster an inclusive research community of investigators around the world with a common research goal. Because of the minimal expense associated with setting up and sampling a single NutNet site, many current NutNet collaborators are young investigators or those from developing countries. The combined efforts of all NutNet participants will produce a replicated experimental infrastructure of unprecedented scope. Several high-profile publications should arise from the NutNet, addressing pressing societal issues such as grassland responses to eutrophication.

These materials have a large sensitivity to their environment, which makes them suitable for use in so-called smart-material devices which can improve the way many different electronic devices work. <br/><br/>New formalisms and computational algorithms will be developed and then applied to systems that are being investigated experimentally by leading experimental groups around the world. Some examples include (i) examining how capacitance (capacity to store charge) can be modified in these systems, (ii) examining heat-induced electrical current or electrical current-induced heat transport in such multi-layer systems of sizes some 100,000 times smaller than the human hair, and (iii) examining how Ohm's law (which states that the voltage drop across a resistor is linearly proportional to the current through it) is violated in these devices by studying the so-called non-linear effects, that could potentially lead to ultrafast electronic switches. <br/><br/>This project supports the training of graduate students in computational physics, both in the academic research environment and through year-long research internships at the IBM Almaden Research Center.

It is atmospheric radiative transfer and its sensitivity to the atmosphere's evolving chemical content that governs Earth's temperature and drives potential climate change. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This award provides support for travel by eight U.S. researchers to the Sixth International Symposium on Radiative Transport, which will be held in Antalya, Turkey, on June 13 - 18, 2010. This meeting has been held periodically since 1995, and is a premier event attracting scientists and engineers in the field of radiative heat transfer. Priority will be given to U.S. Ph.D. students and post-doctoral associates working in radiative transfer. Support for pre-tenure faculty members at U.S. academic institutions will also be considered for support.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The symposium will be attended by a diverse cadre of researchers including physicists, chemists, materials scientists, atmospheric scientists, power production engineers, manufacturing engineers, and others who are concerned with a wide spectrum of fundamental challenges and opportunities in radiative transport. Continuing a tradition from previous symposia, it is expected that the most important 30 to 35 papers will be published in a special issue of the Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer, which is a premier journal in the subject matter of the symposium, and of which the PI and co-PI are associate-technical and technical editors, respectively. Efforts will be made to include participation of students and young faculty members from underrepresented groups.
1033661	Process Optimization Without an Algebraic Model	CBET	Proc Sys, Reac Eng & Mol Therm, CI REUSE	09/01/2010	09/02/2010	Nikolaos Sahinidis	PA	Carnegie-Mellon University	Continuing grant	Maria Burka	08/31/2013	$364,093.00		sahinidis@cmu.edu	5000 Forbes Avenue	PITTSBURGH	PA	152133815	4122689527	ENG	1403, 6892	050E, 7752	$0.00	1033661<br/>Sahinidis<br/><br/>The area of optimization is a strong focus of the process systems engineering community. As a result, a plethora of models, algorithms, and software have been developed for algebraic nonlinear programs (NLPs) and mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs). These techniques have had and will continue to have an impact in process synthesis, design, and operations. Yet, the algebraic NLP/MINLP paradigm:<br/>o often requires modelers to make restrictive assumptions in order to make possible the solution of their models with current optimization software;<br/>o is inefficient when expensive simulations must be carried out for modeling complex systems via proprietary software; and<br/>o is not in line with engineering practice, where technological developments are almost always based on experimental measurements rather than algebraic models.<br/><br/>Experiments, in particular, provide measurements of the objective function to be optimized but no direct information on derivatives or any other information required by algebraic NLP/MINLP optimization. This project aims to develop optimization algorithms and software capable of optimizing without an explicit algebraic model. Towards this goal, the PS plans to:<br/>o complete a critical comparison of existing methods for this problem, especially in regard to their ability to find global solutions and improve starting points;<br/>o develop novel local and global optimization algorithms for optimizing systems described by any combination of algebraic, simulation, and experimental components;<br/>o use previously developed algorithms to optimize systems involving multiple scales, hidden constraints, and noisy objective functions;<br/>o develop and make available innovative software that relies on modern cyberinfrastruc-<br/>ture and implements the algorithms developed in this research.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/><br/>The project will lay the foundations of a new generation of optimization algorithms and software capable of solving complex problems for which algebraic NLPs and MINLPs are not available. Such problems abound in all scientific fields that rely on simulation or experiments for design and optimization. The task of optimizing algebraic NLPs and MINLPs is, in general, a very challenging one. Optimizing without explicit algebraic models can be even more challenging. This research addresses that challenge by capitalizing on recent progress in global optimization of algebraic NLPs and MINLPs to develop new, more efficient algorithms for algebraic-model-free optimization.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/><br/>The project involves graduate student mentoring, integration of research results in course work, targeted minority student recruitment, and broad dissemination of the results through innovative cyber-enabled software implementing the results of the research. In addition, the research will have an immediate and wide impact on industrial practice as it specifically provides algorithms for experiment-based optimization and design.

Ozone (O3), a powerful air pollutant, damages plants such that the regulation of transpiration and photosynthesis is altered ultimately leading to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and water concentrations.  This project will incorporate experimentally determined effects of O3 on plant photosynthesis and transpiration into a commonly used global climate simulation model developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). <br/>This project will be the first to use a climate model to differentiate between responses of transpiration and photosynthesis to O3 exposure.  Incorporating changes in both transpiration and photosynthesis will allow for more accurate representations of future changes to regional and global hydrology and climate.  This will improve the predictive power of climate models and the understanding of global scale plant responses to O3.  These improved predictions can be used to inform future air pollution and climate policy decisions.

Storrs	CT	062691133	8604863622	MPS	1263		$0.00	This project is devoted to the study of stochastic analysis in infinite dimensions. The main topic is stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in infinite-dimensional curved spaces, such as infinite-dimensional groups, loop groups and path spaces. The questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions of the SDEs and smoothness of solutions will be studied. These solutions will be used to construct and study heat kernel measures (a non-commutative analogue of Gaussian or Wiener measure) on infinite-dimensional manifolds. In general these infinite-dimensional spaces do not have an analogue of the Lebesgue measure or a Haar measure in the group case. The PI intends to study Cameron-Martin type quasi-invariance of these measures. It is an interesting question in itself, and in addition it can give rise to unitary representations of the infinite-dimensional groups. One part of the proposal is devoted to studying an energy representation of path groups. It is proposed to study properties of square-integrable holomorphic functions, including non-linear analogues of the Segal-Bargmann transform and bosonic Fock space representations. Levy processes in Lie groups will be studied.<br/><br/>The proposed research will connect diverse fields: stochastic analysis, geometric analysis, representation theory and mathematical physics. This research project has broader impacts on diverse areas of mathematics such as stochastic analysis, representation theory, geometric analysis etc, and it involves activities which help to disseminate the knowledge of new findings in the field. The motivation comes from several subjects.<br/>Infinite-dimensional spaces such as loop groups and path spaces appear in physics, for example, in quantum field theory. The PI proposes to formalize and study some of the notions used in physics, such as measures on certain infinite-dimensional spaces. In addition, it has a significant educational component, namely, it involves graduate students of the PI.

While it is widely accepted that evolution by natural selection promotes adaptation to different environments over time, how exactly one species splits into two is highly controversial. This process, known as speciation, is the primary way Earth's diversity of life is formed. However, the mechanisms of speciation are in many ways mysterious. These investigations will use experimental hybridization of plants in the family Asteracea, along with detailed physiological measurements and field studies of hybrids and parental species growing in their natural habitats to determine how natural selection creates two species from one.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are severalfold. First, the PIs will continue to use research assistants from rural communities near field sites in remote regions of Mexico and the southwest United States. These communities traditionally have been underserved by the scientific infrastructure of both countries and contain high proportions of minorities underrepresented in science. Secondly, this project will contribute to general knowledge of the diversity of life and how it is formed. Concrete examples of questions these studies can assist in answering include: Should different populations be considered endangered species? Are populations within a species evolutionary significant units? What will happen in the future if evolutionary different populations are preserved? While these questions cannot be directly answered by this project, the information gained by these investigations will provide policy makers with the scientific data they need to make intelligent, informed decisions.

While ZnO has many inherent advantages, the lack of control over dopants and defects presents an obstacle to the realization of practical devices. Reliable p-type conductivity, necessary for widespread applications, has been elusive. A key challenge is to introduce acceptors without being overwhelmed by compensating donors. <br/>Hydrogen plays a central role in acceptor doping of ZnO as well as unintentional n-type conductivity. The proposed work will focus on different forms of hydrogen in ZnO and related materials. Specifically, interstitial hydrogen donors, substitutional hydrogen donors, acceptor-hydrogen complexes, and vacancy-hydrogen complexes will be investigated with a range of experimental techniques. In this renewal proposal, research will be extended from ZnO to other oxide crystals, including tin oxide and strontium titanate. The proposed work will shed light on the origins of n-type conductivity in transparent conducting oxides, an open question with technological ramifications. <br/>The overall goal of the project is to investigate the behavior of hydrogen in ZnO and other oxide crystals. <br/>The research goals will promote a fundamental understanding of hydrogen in semiconductors. By extending the research to oxide crystals, the PI will investigate the possibility of universal behavior across different materials systems. The most high-risk goal is the achievement of p-type ZnO. Reliable p-type conductivity in ZnO would be transformative, opening up a range of novel applications. This renewal project builds on significant work by the PI's research group that resulted in high-impact publications, invited talks, Ph.D. dissertations, and undergraduate research experiences. <br/><br/>Non-technical: <br/>The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance, and is expected to provide unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate training in an interdisciplinary field. This research project is also expected to have broader impacts through the training of scientists in this research field, through the wide dissemination of the findings of this research through publications. The proposed educational activities will also benefit a range of students from elementary to Ph.D. In conjunction with the research part of this proposal, educational and outreach activities will encourage students from diverse backgrounds to enter fields related to materials science and solid-state physics.

In contrast, Ethernet is largely plug-&-play; however, this traditional layer-2 technology can hardly meet the scale as well as the efficiency and robustness requirements of emerging and future large, dynamic networks such as data centers and cloud-computing services.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI is developing VIRO --- a novel and paradigm-shifting approach to network routing and forwarding. VIRO simultaneously addresses the challenges faced by IP networks and Ethernet by decoupling routing from addressing and by integrating and unifying routing and forwarding performed by the traditional layer-2 and layer 3. VIRO introduces a topology-aware, structured virtual identifier (vid) space onto which both physical identifiers and higher layer addresses/names are mapped. It employs innovative DHT-style routing mechanisms to build end-to-end connectivity from bottom-up, and to route/forward data packets using vids only. Hence, VIRO is not only highly scalable and robust, but also namespace-independent. <br/><br/>This research project has the potential to reduce the complexity and costs of operating and managing future large, dynamic networks, and to foster creation and deployment of new Internet services. The PI plans to disseminate the research outcomes through publications and outreach activities. VIRO prototypes will be implemented and made publicly available. Through participation in future Internet design forums and collaboration with industrial partners, the PI will seek to impact the larger industry behind Internet technologies.

This project is based on the hierarchical, high-throughput assembly of functionalized tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) nanotemplates with hydrogel microparticles via nucleic acid hybridization. This approach enables seamless integration of nano-, bio- and synthetic materials with unprecedented density, selectivity, programmability and orientational control. The significance of the project is that the new multiplexed sensing platforms will integrate hydrogel particles with the biofunctionality of TMV via highly programmable biochemical interactions to achieve features and performances beyond what is possible with individual technologies or mere addition of the two. Furthermore, the research will pave the way for moving beyond 2D patterning of viruses on surfaces and move this into 3D particle environments. The broad impact of this project is further enhanced by strong educational components such as extensive recruitment and exchange of undergraduate researchers, exchange lectures and shared research experience between MIT and Tufts University. As a part if this project, educational videos on nanotechnology and self-assembly for K-12 students and teachers will be available online via a public radio station in the area as part of the National Science Digital Library.<br/><br/>The ability to simultaneously assay for multiple target molecules in a complex mixture in a high-throughput capacity is an unmet challenge. This project will tackle this by integrating harmless viral templates and polymer microparticles to create multiplexed sensing systems by nucleic acid hybridization. This research is important for the general health and safety of the public in that the technology will pave new ways to rapidly monitor food pathogens, biological threats and environmental hazards. The research will also lead to ways in designing new methods to process viruses for use as high-value added materials. The education of the public will further benefit from this project by exposing a large number of undergraduate and K-12 students to cutting-edge research projects. In addition, educational video clips will be freely available to students and science teachers at grade schools from National Science Digital Library.

Combinations of ion exchange, reductive intercalation, and/or oxidative intercalation will be used to build extended arrays within layered oxide hosts. Emphasis will be placed on multistep reaction processing where the sequential application of topochemical methods will lead to new intricately layered products. This program is expected in the long term to contribute to the development of an extensive series of low temperature topochemical reaction strategies where a comprehensive library of reactions can be envisioned that would allow for the directed, rational synthesis of new non-molecular target compounds with specific structural, electronic and magnetic features. <br/> With respect to the educational impact, efforts here will focus on the training of students and postdoctoral associates. Participants will gain valuable training in the synthesis and characterization of new materials as well as the presentation and publication of scientific data. A further aspect of this program is the involvement of international students where undergraduate and/or graduate students from France will work in the PI's laboratory; this effort will serve to promote solid-state chemistry at the international level. Finally, to help promote science in the New Orleans area, local high school students will be involved in this research program each summer.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/> New methods will be developed that will allow the preparation of new oxide materials. These methods are expected to expand chemists' current capabilities and allow for the effective synthesis of new compounds of technological importance, such as new electronic and/or magnetic materials. This program will also help to train scientists in materials chemistry and general scientific methods. Personnel in this program will include postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduates. In terms of international impact, science students from France will work in the PI's lab as part of their training and the PI will continue ongoing collaborative projects with researchers in Japan. Further, to help promote science in the New Orleans area, local high school students will be involved in this research program each summer.

NASSLLI is a week-long event including thirteen five-hour graduate-level courses given in parallel sessions, two associated workshops, and a session for student papers. The school has run several times in the past and aims to establish itself as a biannual event. The general areas of emphasis for the school are at the intersection of linguistics, philosophy, and computer science, specifically applied logic, computational linguistics, as well as broader themes from cognitive science.<br/><br/>NASSLLI is an interdisciplinary event, designed to foster interactions and provide instruction in ways that would be difficult in traditional academic departments. Most of its topics are not standardly taught at many colleges and universities in the USA and smaller institutions frequently do not have faculty with multi-disciplinary research experience. The summer school will give post-doctoral students, graduate students, and even advanced undergraduates the chance to interact with faculty who are active researchers and leaders in their fields. The school aims to expose the next generation of researchers in linguistics, philosophy, and computer science to a vibrant interdisciplinary research atmosphere, at the same time as it gives them the tools to advance their learning.

The lack of consensus or acceptable best practices around standards, agreed upon definitions, procedures, metrics, and mathematical techniques have left supervisory agencies unable to ingest market information in either a timely manner that would permit a macro-prudential response, or even determine what information might be missing. This has resulted in the following unsatisfactory situation:<br/> * Corporate managers are uncertain of the trustworthiness of<br/> their internal risk and accounting numbers;<br/> * The academic community is lacking the information required to<br/> examine and analyze actual market operations and behavior;<br/> * Regulators, analysts, and the financial press are denied an<br/> understanding of capital market operations sufficient to<br/> forge knowledgeable and prudent financial policy.<br/><br/>The purpose of this NSF-sponsored workshop is to help develop the underlying theory and framework that might unify the disparate ongoing and planned efforts at understanding and managing the enormous data and information flows in the financial services industry, and to develop a comprehensive list of the challenges in this domain with respect to robust risk assessment and management.<br/><br/>The workshop will draw upon an interdisciplinary team of experts from computer science (data management and mining and knowledge representation), finance, mathematics, economics and operations research. The workshop will generate a report which will develop a comprehensive list of the challenges in this domain including the fundamental forces and constraints and policies and models of information management that are critical for robust financial risk management.

The first main theme of the proposed research is to study exotic smooth structures on small simply connected four-manifolds. The Principal Investigator and his collaborator B. Doug Park have shown that the complex projective plane blown up at two, three, and four points admit exotic irreducible smooth structures. The PI will continue his study with an aim of further understanding of smooth structures on small four-manifolds such as CP^2, S^2 x S^2, and CP^2#(-CP^2). The initial work suggests that it would be possible to construct an exotic smooth structure on some of these remaining small four-manifolds. The proposed research will also focus on the geography problem for smooth irreducible simply connected four-manifolds and the construction of surface bundles over surfaces with non-zero signature. This project may lead to new theorems on spin and non-spin symplectic geography, and provide new constructions relevant to attack the Symplectic Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau conjecture. A final theme in the proposed research is the construction of Stein and strong symplectic fillings of certain contact three-manifolds.<br/><br/>This proposal studies the exotic smooth structures on small four-dimensional manifolds, i.e. the geometric objects which are locally modeled on space-time. Although it is known that many smooth four-dimensional manifolds admit the exotic smooth structures, such structures are very hard to construct if the manifold is small. The famous smooth four-dimensional Poincare conjecture illustrates this phenomenon. The PI recently developed a new and very effective technique that allows to tackle these small four-dimensional manifolds. The PI's approach shows a great promise in understanding the classification of smooth four-dimensional manifolds. This project uses the ideas and tools from several fields of mathematics, such as geometric topology, symplectic geometry, complex algebraic geometry, group theory and gauge theory. The problems involved in this research project also have interesting applications to physics, such as mirror symmetry and string theory.

A limitation of existing VoD services, both<br/>using traditional design as well as P2P is their inability to support<br/>efficient streamed access to ALL content at high quality,<br/>regardless of demand: not just blockbusters that millions want to<br/>see, but also niche content that has relatively small demand in<br/>comparison to their highly popular counterparts: re-runs of TV shows,<br/>non-blockbuster releases, replays of sporting events, and speeches.<br/><br/>The peer-to-peer (P2P) approach is an effective<br/>solution for scalable content distribution without imposing a<br/>significant burden on a centralized infrastructure. In a P2P-based<br/>VoD system, users receive streamed videos from VoD servers as well as<br/>from the peers. The ability of peers that are viewing the videos to<br/>collaborate with each other reduces the load on serving<br/>infrastructure.<br/><br/>This project extends the design of successful P2P VoD systems to<br/>enable support for efficient delivery of a large, potentially<br/>limitless library of high (movie) quality stored VoD. Regardless of<br/>a video's popularity, a high-quality version will be playable by any<br/>client attached to the network without interruption within seconds of<br/>its request. The research utilizes three design principles: leverage<br/>P2P technologies, implement altruistic cross-content caching and<br/>serving, and utilize playback-point weighted caching strategies.<br/>Results include models that describe desirable caching behavior,<br/>distributed algorithms to implement the desired caching behavior, and<br/>a functional prototype.

Garrison	07/31/2011	$46,981.00		stephen.brandt@oregonstate.edu	OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY	Corvallis	OR	973318507	5417374933	GEO	1650	0000, 4444, 5987, 7914, OTHR	$0.00	On April 22, 2010, the drill platform Deepwater Horizon sank in nearly 1,200 m of water in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Since this date various estimates of oil and added chemical dispersants have been released from the site with dispersion both at the surface and at depth. The transport of this oil and dispersants has been influenced by wind-driven currents over the shelf and by the Loop Current and its derivatives offshore. To date the exact amount and paths of movement of the Horizon spill remain speculative. Since 2003, with NOAA-CSCOR funding, this group of investigators has conducted 5 summer cruises in the northern Gulf of Mexico that used high-resolution sampling to define the spatially explicit relationships between physical structure to pelagic zooplankton and fish distributions. Thus this group has one of the most comprehensive, synoptic data sets on temperature, salinity, oxygen, phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish in the northern Gulf of Mexico for conditions prior to the oil leak.<br/><br/>The current RAPID award will allow this group to repeat their high-resolution mapping of hydrography, oxygen, plankton and fish in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The domain of interest will include the previous survey region in the hypoxic zone west of the Mississippi Delta but also the area east of the Mississippi where more oil transport from the spill has been suggested. The cruise will take place in the late summer period because the investigators have 5 years of ?baseline? data during this season to compare the results. The measures of species diversity and abundance, biomass size spectrum, fish diets, fish growth rate potential and ecosystem models will all be extremely useful to assess the possible effects of the oil spill on the living resources of the northern Gulf of Mexico. In addition to the rapid mapping cruise on the inner to mid-shelf, this group also will send scientists on the ORV Oceanus to conduct high resolution vertical zooplankton measurements (LOPC and TAPS) and MOCNESS zooplankton tows at deeper stations and broader mapping surveys to extend our spatial coverage of the affected area. They will coordinate our zooplankton and fish measurements with other investigators assessing the biogeochemical and biological impacts of the BP oil spill. Data from previous NOAA will be deposited in the BCODMO data management facility as well as current measurements and model products.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Given the economic importance of the Gulf of Mexico commercial fisheries (about 20% of the U.S. total landings representing about $991 million) and recreational fishing (generating ~30% of the nation?s saltwater fishing expenditures and supporting nearly 25% of the nation?s recreational saltwater jobs), it is imperative that knowledge of the effects of the BP oil spill on the pelagic ecosystem be assessed. The Horn Point Laboratory and Oregon State University are part of the National Science Foundation ? Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (NSF-COSEE) and Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs. Where possible in this NSF RAPID response grant, we will involve REU undergraduate students and teachers in our proposed research program.

The project is feasible for small, rural high schools with enrollments of fewer than 350 students and limited resources. Many manufacturing and energy companies struggle to hire entry-level employees with the necessary math, science and basic technical skills. Area high schools offer no manufacturing or energy related courses and students have little knowledge of those expanding career sectors. Additionally, over sixty percent of partner high school students score below state math and science proficiency standards. With industry-education collaboration, this project improves math and science proficiency by inserting industry-based contextual learning modules into grades 9 and 10 algebra, geometry and physical science courses. Industry technicians and college faculty assist teachers with curriculum and instruction and present special hands-on industry related workshops for students. High school juniors and seniors enroll in a dual-credit Technological Studies Certificate program offered through the college and are awarded a technical certificate upon completion. Enrolled students acquire foundational knowledge for entry-level manufacturing and energy jobs or prepare for 2 and 4-year technical majors. Students are able to connect math and science success with high demand careers.

The new properties result from interactions at nanometer length scales at the interface between the two solid-state phases. The proposed systems are from the family of Prussian blue analogs, for which a wide range of magnetic phenomena have been observed, including the ability to combine magnetism with photoactivity. As part of these studies, the project aims to improve and quantify the currently used solution- based thin film deposition procedures, and to extend the concept of photomagnetic coordination polymer heterostructures to multicomponent particles. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>New synthesis and fabrication methodologies developed in the study supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) will be generally applicable to other classes of coordination polymer nanostructures and will be useful for high-technology applications ranging from information storage to light harvesting. In addition, training related to solid-state synthesis, nanoscale fabrication, magnetism, and light-induced magnetism will provide graduate and undergraduate student researchers with the skills and knowledge needed to be competitive in materials chemistry related high-technology professions. The proposed project also establishes cooperation between disciplines and among both US and international partners. Students and faculty from the Department of Physical Sciences at Concord University in Athens, West Virginia, a non-Ph.D. granting EPSCoR institution, will carry out coordination polymer synthesis associated with the project. Research tasks involve collaborative projects between chemists and physicists, providing an opportunity for students to learn the importance of interdisciplinary study and the tools necessary to communicate with scientists in different fields.

The idea for this special issue emerged from discussions within the U.S. National Committee for the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) (reporting to the State Department and the U.S. Representative to the IOC) pertaining to U.S involvement in the 50th anniversary. <br/><br/>This volume, proposed as part of the U.S.-supported contributions to ?the 50th? celebrations of the IOC, will highlight important international science that has been implemented as a result of the strong partnership between the United States and IOC, show U.S. appreciation of the important international efforts the IOC has supported in this partnership, and educate younger scientists about the role of the IOC in fostering international research cooperation in partnership with the United States.<br/><br/>The United States has been an active Member State of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) since its establishment at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1960. Of particular interest to the United States is the key role played by the IOC in facilitating and coordinating the collection and distribution of ocean data. The United States (NOAA, NSF, US State Department) contributes about US$1.5 million per year to the IOC in direct and indirect funds. IOC is important as the intergovernmental mechanism for coordinating access to exclusive economic zones for purposes of ocean data collection. It serves as a forum for addressing issues such as ocean data exchange policies and internationally agreed standards and strategies for long-term ocean observing activities. The capacity building mission of the IOC helps developing countries through the combined efforts of all Member States. <br/><br/>NSF has been providing its contribution to IOC for at least 25 years. It seems fitting that NSF fund a TOS special issue commemorating the 50 years of IOC contributions to ocean science. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/><br/>The proposed chapters for this special issue cover a wide array of topics and current directions in oceanography, ranging from basic approaches and methodologies needed to address contemporary topics in oceanography, including ocean circulation, C cycling, living marine resources, harmful algal blooms and problems. Relevant time and space scales for addressing these topics will be discussed and approaches to synthesis of data in order to make it meaningful to the scientific and management communities as well as decision makers and formulating policy will be covered. The list of prospective authors that are experts in these respective research and management areas is impressive.

GENI has the goal of becoming the first laboratory for exploring networks of the future through innovatations in network science, security, technology, services and applications.<br/><br/>The workshop attendees will consist of 20 to 30 two-person teams, typically, a researcher and his or her graduate student, selected through a white paper competition. They will be given technical tutorials on the various GENI components and resources and how to launch experiments that span more than one part of the infrastructure (e.g., bridging PlanetLab, Proto-GENI and OpenFlow.) The researchers will also have opportunities to propose experiments and describe the associated operational, workflow, instrumentation, measurement, and security requirements for that experiment. <br/><br/>This workshop will develop a common understanding of the GENI network infrastructure and build a community of researchers using GENI for their experiments. It is expected that some of these teams will propose their experiments to NSF, which will result in the demonstration of new research ideas and experiments not possible on any other network testbed.

All ICs employ DFM rules and guidelines that are constraints that prevent or limit the use of certain physical structures within the IC. Such structures are constrained since they are difficult to manufacture implying they have a less-than-acceptable likelihood for causing chip failure. Thus DFM is meant to ensure ICs yield at acceptable levels. Deployment of DFM does have a cost however since its application requires the use of complex design tools that typically require weeks of compute time to check for design compliance. Moreover, performance degradation results when the IC is modified to satisfy DFM constraints. While the costs of DFM are clear, there is however no direct way of measuring DFM effectiveness. In other words, how well a specific rule or guideline actually ensures yield is an open question. This SBIR project will develop and implement software that analyzes the design data and tester data from failing ICs to directly measure the effectiveness DFM rules/guidelines.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will enable chip designers and manufacturers to employ only those DFM rules/guidelines that are actually effective. This means that chip yield will improve since the overall design will be more manufacturable, chip quality will improve since systematic failures that are more likely to escape detection will be reduced, chip design cost will decrease since the time needed to deploy DFM will be reduced since only the effective rules will be used, and chip performance will improve since the design will be altered less since only the most effective rules will be used.

The PI's team will develop a new computer code to solve the 'reduced MHD' (RMHD) equations for incompressible turbulence, taking account of the inhomogeneous density and background flow characteristics of the solar wind. These fundamental equations will be solved under a variety of conditions and the solutions will be used to examine plasma density effects and the heating of test-particle ions propagating within the computed electromagnetic fields. The PI's approach is novel because of its inclusion of reflected waves in his turbulence model. His numerical results will be used to test several existing theories of turbulence and to revise these theories as needed to account for wave reflection. <br/><br/>Based on this work, the PI will deliver targeted lectures in plasma physics short courses developed for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and advanced undergraduate students. By providing these young scientists with specialized training and exposure to ongoing research developments, these short courses will promote the integration of research and education. The PI is also a Working Group Leader in the Solar, Heliospheric, and Interplanetary Environment (SHINE) research community, as well as a member of the SHINE Steering Committee. In this capacity, the PI will actively contribute to organizing the annual SHINE Workshop, which provides student participants with special tutorial sessions and opportunities to present their own research. By placing a high priority on student involvement, the SHINE Workshop has been an effective means of integrating research and education.

Generally, the researchers will improve existing analytical methods and develop new statistical methods for the reconstruction of past climates from heterogeneous geological proxies (tree rings, ice cores, speleothems, corals, sediments), with particular emphasis on regional variability over the past two millennia. <br/><br/>Specifically, the research team will use the regularized expectation-maximization algorithm (RegEM) algorithm to exploit linear covariation in space among different climate variables or proxies to impute missing values and estimate climate statistics. The goal is to directly address uncertainties in data, especially surrounding missing data within a series. This is important for paleoclimate data sets since the spatial or temporal series may not be continuous.<br/><br/>The broader impacts involve the training of students across disciplinary boundaries in a timely integration of statistics and climatology.

The work is predicated by the fact that markedly different magnetic responses will be elicited for ceramics in different materials states, allowing an investigation of nanoscale physical phenomena that have been previously inaccessible. The main scientific objective is to correlate the different magnetic response of ceramic materials with nanoscale-structure features. The results will have broad implication across many technical energy applications where challenges exist in understanding and controlling nanoscale phenomena, but are also expected to impact the ceramics community by helping to advance the metrology of magnetic based measurements. The industrial partner, Quantum Design, is a leader in the magnetic equipment industry and will engage students during the project. The students will also organize and run an annual on-campus conference in ceramics with participation from industry, faculty and members of the local community. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: A systematic experimental research program is designed to correlate the magnetic behavior of doped ceramic oxides with nanoscale features that will be independently measured with a suite of materials characterization tools and interpreted with kinetics and thermodynamics theory. The research is based on the fact that the magnetic response of doped ceramics is highly sensitive to different internal material states: (1) the undoped ceramic; (2) metallic ions in solution within the doped ceramic; (3) metallic ions as an oxide; and (4) metal particles. Two host ceramics, one based on ZrO2 and one based on the perovskite structure, are doped with various transition metals (Ni, Co, and Fe) to create a variety of structures that exhibit different magnetic responses. The research lays the foundation to advance the state of nanoscale metrology for magnetometry. Students will be engaged and trained in the potentially transformative magnetometry characterization tools developed.

Recent studies show that significant diffusion occurs when Mn and Fe containing ferromagnetic metals are grown on GaAs or Si. There are also recent reports showing evidence of spin scattering after spin-polarized carriers are injected into nonmagnetic structures. It is therefore important to investigate this problem systematically, so that the analysis of injection results can be improved. This project focuses on diffusion of magnetic ions in the most studied systems, namely Fe/GaAs, FeCo/GaAs, MnAs/GaAs and GaMnAs/GaAs, and on selected structures involving silicon. The samples are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Diffusion profiles are determined using time-of-flight second ion mass spectroscopy and cross sectional scanning tunneling microscopy. The effect of diffused magnetic ions on spin injection is primarily determined with spin light emitting diode structures, which have been effective in determining the level of spin polarization of the injected electrons. The study is designed to provide quantitative information concerning the profile of diffused magnetic ions in nonmagnetic semiconductors, and their effect on spin injection. By examining diffusion as a function of temperature through annealing, one is able to put upper limits on growth and device processing temperatures. The project also explores the possibility of suppressing diffusion processes for the magnetic ions.<br/>Non-technical: This scientific work could have a significant impact on the development of future generations of information technology. It addresses a common issue that exists in most studies of spin effects involving transport of spin polarized currents from one material to another. This would include studies of spin light emitting diodes, spin lasers, spin valves and other more complicated spin-logic devices that involve ferromagnetic materials. The project also contributes to training the next generation of scientists by adding another venue to provide interdisciplinary training to students for the three investigators who have a long history of jointly advising graduate students in physics and chemistry. In addition, the project involves outreach to the Native American Magnet School (K-8) in Buffalo and engages, at an early stage, Native American and African American students in sciences and engineering.

The novelty of the work in both of these frameworks is that in each case the investigator and his group are finding powerful ways in which the most advanced methods for nonlinear programming can be enhanced and broadened to remain effective for application areas in which they have previously been inefficient or inapplicable. In the context of large-scale PDE-constrained problems, such as those in optimal design, parameter estimation, and image registration, this is being achieved by removing the need for the factorization of matrices and allowing for inexactness in the solution of large-scale linear systems, while still guaranteeing convergence to a solution point. In the context of nonsmooth applications, such as those in compressed sensing and robust stability and control, this is being achieved by enhancing leading algorithmic frameworks through a process of gradient sampling, allowing for a loosening of the assumption that the problem functions are differentiable everywhere. These works in these fields tie together algorithms and computational techniques from diverse areas, and both numerical methods and convergence theory are being provided.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this project is that it advances pencil-and-paper engineering ideas to the point where they can be implemented in high-performance computing software and are able to solve challenging problems in the design and analysis of complex systems. For example, there is a high demand for optimization tools such as these in healthcare, particularly in the area of cancer treatment and therapy. By providing doctors and medical technicians with novel computational tools, they will be able to optimally administer hyperthermia treatment in a manner that takes into account the inner complexities of the human body, such as blood flow. They will also be able to effectively and adaptively design plans for radiation therapy that minimize damage to healthy -- and often critical -- tissue near the target area(s). Amazingly enough, these same computational tools can also be employed in medical image registration, aiding medical professionals in the detection of irregularities over time and between different (e.g., PET, CT, MRI) scans. The goal in all of these areas is to provide the user with sophisticated software that can answer, in real-time, difficult questions such as What is the optimal way of administering this radiation? and Is there anything in this image that has changed or is cause for alarm?

Admin.	Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	ENG	1517		$0.00	Spintronics is an emerging area in solid state science and engineering. Its broad goal is to utilize carriers, spin to realize novel electronic devices that rely on the creation, manipulation, and detection of spin and spin-currents. If successful, such manipulation of spins could also impact the even more exotic field of quantum computing, as spin is the leading candidate for registering the quantum bit of information in the proposed quantum computers. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to explore ballistic transport in clean, two-dimensional carrier systems in modulation-doped semiconductors. The project includes the fabrication and study of a number of devices whose operation relies on the manipulation of spin and/or valley degrees of freedom. The devices will be based on two different carrier systems: (1) two-dimensional hole system in GaAs quantum wells which possesses a strong and tunable spin-orbit interaction, and (2) two-dimensional electron system in AlAs quantum wells where the electrons occupy conduction band valleys with tunable densities, and have a large Lande effective g-factor so that the electrons can be easily spin-polarized. The project will involve crystal growth of the basic materials via molecular beam epitaxy, fabrication of various devices using modern lithography techniques, and transport measurements.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The project will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the ballistic transport in semiconductor structures. Such knowledge is essential for advancements in the emerging fields <br/>of spintronics and quantum computing. It can also lead to the development of unforeseen device concepts. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The impact of the project will be seen in the scientific community and beyond. Results of the research will be communicated through publications and conference presentations to the specialized as well as general science and engineering communities, where the topic is generating substantial interest. Progress in this area will also benefit society in the long term as it may lead to novel electronic devices and information processing systems.<br/><br/>The project incorporates a high quality and comprehensive educational component. It will result in the education of students in critical, state-of-the art areas of science and technology, including the fabrication, characterization, and physics of high quality layered semiconductor structures. Well-trained students in these fields will be invaluable resources for the US as well as for the rest of the world. The PI will also make every effort to attract to this project students from underrepresented groups.<br/>The PI is committed to a broader education of the public in science and engineering. Some of the topics and results of this project will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses that he teaches at Princeton University. The PI will also participate in various K-12 demonstrations and teacher training programs in electricity and magnetism, general areas that are closely linked to the topic of this proposal. These activities include training sessions, kit development, and demonstrations at regional school, and at Princeton University.

Anatase is a well known photo-catalyst. The co-founders of the Nanospring platform hold a patent on the project catalyst system that has shown the ability to convert CO2 to methanol (using a gas-to-gas continuous reactor, patent applied for), and, possibly, formic acid and formaldehyde at room temperature. Specifically, the research will develop and test a filter-type system that could be retrofitted in-line of the exhaust stacks at power and industrial plants. This approach is termed Carbon Capture and Recycle. The Research Plan addresses three objectives by three sets of tests at the laboratory scale: 1) evaluation of the catalytic properties of the TiO2-coated silica Nanosprings mat formed on a 100 um glass frit; 2) optimization of the catalyst coating; and 3) evaluation and testing of the prototype catalyst filter system using 'real world' flue gas emissions.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be the potential for successful commercial application. There is a need for technologies that will reduce the carbon emitted to the atmosphere from coal-fired plants, and the project includes support from a large power company. The technology is particularly competitive for power plants that are long distances from geologically suitable CO2 storage sites. The process not only will be continuous flow but also could be by-product tuneable, i.e., generating a variety of chemicals by controlling operating conditions. Based on the 30% efficiency identified in the preliminary laboratory testing, the process could convert one metric ton of CO2 into 0.245 metric tons of methanol.

Lack of basic natural history information limits understanding of many fundamental principles and processes of ecology and evolutionary biology and their applications to environmental problem-solving. This project will support a series of three collaborative workshops that will examine the roles of natural history in research and education, develop mechanisms to increase the availability of natural history information, and improve the interfaces of natural history with research, education, and applied science. <br/><br/> This project will result in an assessment of information gaps and priority research areas; suggested procedures to improve communication of natural history among the educational, business, agency, and non-profit practitioners and users of natural history; and a network to expand natural history information and its use. Each workshop includes provision for greater impacts of the activities, including participation by students and post-doctoral scientists, post-conference assessment of impact of the workshop on the institutions of participants, production of podcasts to be made available through the internet, and panel discussions for the general public. The workshops will produce a broad post-workshop initiative to improve the interfaces of natural history with education, research, and environmental problem-solving.
1020725	Studying Inequality through the Lifeworlds of Infants	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY	06/15/2010	06/18/2010	Tobias Hecht	CA	Hecht Tobias	Standard Grant	Deborah Winslow	05/31/2012	$29,752.00				Claremont	CA	917114167		SBE	1390	7916, 1390	$0.00	Dr. Tobias Hecht will undertake the first, exploratory stage of an ethnographic study of the lifeworlds of infants, comparing those born to middle-class families, on the one hand, with those born into poverty, on the other. Ultimately, the project aims to examine how social and economic inequality is initially manifest and experienced: how, in other words, people first come to lead unequal lives. The fieldwork will be carried out in FlorianÛpolis, Brazil, a city where many enjoy a first-world standard of living but where others endure extreme poverty. <br/><br/>Despite the existence of a vast literature on inequality, including inequality in Brazil, that body of writings almost wholly ignores the lives of infants. Most data on inequality still derive from income surveys that do not assess how income is used and distributed within the household, much less how it affects babies. Infants are surely the most underrepresented segment in society and the least studied human subjects outside of the field of developmental psychology. Though prescriptive writings on caring for babies abound, remarkably little is known about their everyday lives. This project concerns not what should be done with infants nor specifically how they develop but rather how infants are from birth enmeshed in the larger social and economic problems of inequality. <br/><br/>One of the goals of the project is to develop new research methods for the fledgling field of infant-centered ethnographic research. The researcher will focus on the children's everyday lives -- where they sleep, what they do when awake, what they are fed, how they are dressed, spoken to and played with, the social and material culture that surrounds them, how their medical needs are attended to.<br/><br/>This research is important because it has the potential to transform social scientific understanding of what inequality means and how it is experienced in everyday lives from their very beginning. Economists measure inequality above all in terms of household income. Sociologists have studied inequality in its class, racial and sexual dimensions. Here the objective is to suggest a new way of understanding inequality, one that takes into account the least studied group, the ones that cannot possibly be held accountable for their social and economic condition.

This project is based on the hierarchical, high-throughput assembly of functionalized tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) nanotemplates with hydrogel microparticles via nucleic acid hybridization. This approach enables seamless integration of nano-, bio- and synthetic materials with unprecedented density, selectivity, programmability and orientational control. The significance of the project is that the new multiplexed sensing platforms will integrate hydrogel particles with the biofunctionality of TMV via highly programmable biochemical interactions to achieve features and performances beyond what is possible with individual technologies or mere addition of the two. Furthermore, the research will pave the way for moving beyond 2D patterning of viruses on surfaces and move this into 3D particle environments. The broad impact of this project is further enhanced by strong educational components such as extensive recruitment and exchange of undergraduate researchers, exchange lectures and shared research experience between MIT and Tufts University. As a part if this project, educational videos on nanotechnology and self-assembly for K-12 students and teachers will be available online via a public radio station in the area as part of the National Science Digital Library.<br/><br/>The ability to simultaneously assay for multiple target molecules in a complex mixture in a high-throughput capacity is an unmet challenge. This project will tackle this by integrating harmless viral templates and polymer microparticles to create multiplexed sensing systems by nucleic acid hybridization. This research is important for the general health and safety of the public in that the technology will pave new ways to rapidly monitor food pathogens, biological threats and environmental hazards. The research will also lead to ways in designing new methods to process viruses for use as high-value added materials. The education of the public will further benefit from this project by exposing a large number of undergraduate and K-12 students to cutting-edge research projects. In addition, educational video clips will be freely available to students and science teachers at grade schools from National Science Digital Library.

Patients and insurers can avoid repeating studies that, for example, expose people to additional radiation and incur unnecessary costs. Providers can instantly access patient histories , and patients can take ownership of their medical records, with the potential for greater privacy, and better access to their records when they are needed. However, while the promises of EMRs are many, moving from paper-based systems to electronic ones is not without risk. For example, it is a lot easier for an attacker to sneak out of a hospital (or data center) with a USB stick in their pocket containing 8,000 patient records, than with the equivalent paper records. Moving electronic records online makes them particularly vulnerable to Internet-based attacks. These threats are getting worse, as attacks grow in sophistication. This project will focus on developing new security technologies to enable deployment of secure EMRs by utilizing new cryptographic techniques and building a pilot system to deploy within a major hospital. The pilot will enable storage of protected records across a distributed environment that includes untrusted outsourced databases and mobile devices. Patients will be able to interface with Public Healthcare Record (PHR) systems such as Google Health and Microsoft Health Vault or other cloud services. The project includes developing a key management scheme that is able to support the unique requirements of this model and algorithms, including auditing, key revocation, and traitor tracing.

Multiple length scales such as grain size, shell thickness, and diameter of sphere exist within an individual structure. Specifically, our gold nanospheres are about 100 nm in diameter, and feature a polycrystalline shell with a thickness ranging from 20 to 50 nm, and grain size around 5 nm. Such combination provides a ?golden? opportunity to explore the effects of structural hierarchy on the deformation mechanisms of nanoscale materials. Due to their hollow nature, the gold nanospheres can be easily observed and tested with in-situ TEM nanoindentation without elaborate sample preparation. They can be positioned precisely into an addressable array using the ?electrostatic funneling method?. This greatly facilitates nanoindentation experiments, enabling a statistical examination. Model polycrystalline hollow nanoparticles with similar characteristics will be simulated with state-of-the-art multiscale theoretical/computational techniques that combine Molecular Dynamics and Discrete Element Method. Experimental input from the in-situ TEM nanoindentation will greatly facilitate the multiscale modeling, specifically the critical issues of time-acceleration and coarse-graining. The obtained simulation results will help comprehend experimental data and identify deformation mechanisms with atomistic resolution. <br/><br/>The general mechanical behavior of nanoscale metals is of great interest for technological applications such as new ultrastrong structural materials, microelectronics and micro- and nano-electromechanical devices and systems. If successful, this research will help establish important design principles targeting such applications. The proposed combination of Molecular Dynamics with Distinct Element Method to tackle problems at different length scales is expected to find broad applications in the modeling community. The proposed research program is integrated with a multi-layered education and outreach program that includes development of new courses designed to educate students in an interdisciplinary field, summer camps for K-12 students, and outreach activities through MRSEC-UMN, existing REU, cyber module development, and demonstrations at high schools and the Science Museum of Minnesota. A coordinated outreach plan in partnership with the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers is proposed to provide opportunities to underrepresented groups by targeting and involving the large Hispanic population in the State of Texas, which includes a minority recruitment program, a SciTech Latino Summer Camp for K-12 Hispanic students, and a public awareness component.

Preliminary data collected in the beginning of May at the site of the accident show very high concentrations of marine snow in the water, especially in close proximity to the oil/ dispersants. The goal of this project is to evaluate the role these large marine snow-like particles play in the ecosystem during the following weeks to months. Neither the formation mechanisms nor the aggregate composition are known. These investigators will monitor the distribution of marine snow, characterize these particles and measure sedimentation rates to try to understand the role of snow formation and sedimentation in the ecosystem response.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>The characteristics and the potential fate of these marine snow like aggregates, which may potentially sink or float, be grazed, degraded or remain suspended in the water for a long period of time, is unknown. This accident is an opportunity to evaluate and expand our knowledge on reactions of marine ecosystems to such large disturbances in general and more specifically to study the role of aggregation and sedimentation in the process. Marine snow formation and its sedimentation are an essential component of elemental cycling. It has been postulated that sedimentation of material cleans the water column from particles. Marine snow is also thought to be hotspots of microbial activity. Potentially this oily marine snow could not only represent hotspots of activity for oil degrading organisms, but may also function to isolate oil into small volumes. However, rapid sedimentation of such oil aggregates may lead to anoxia at depths. Scientifically we do not understand the possible interactions between marine snow, marine particles, oil and dispersant.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The need to understand the impact of this largest oil spill to date on ecosystems and biochemical cycling is self evident. The consequences of the disaster and accompanying clean up measures (e.g. the distribution of dispersants) need to be evaluated to guide further mediating measures and to develop and improve responses to similar disasters in the future. Would it be advantageous if such oil aggregates sink, or should it rather remain suspended? Possibly measures can be developed to enhance sinking or suspension (e.g. addition of ballast minerals) once we understand their current formation and fate. Understanding the particle dynamics following the input of large amounts of oil and dispersants into the water is a prerequisite to develop response strategies for now and in the future.

These materials are structurally related to GaN, InN and AlN, and share some of their properties, such as band gaps that span the wavelength range from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. Theories have predicted some distinctly different properties, in particular their doping and defect properties, nonlinear optical properties, and lower ionicities. These important differences motivate interest in studying ZnGeN2 and related materials, to both expand our fundamental understanding of materials and to explore their potential for applications to optoelectronics that would take advantage of their unique properties. The project develops new growth methods for these materials and explores their thermodynamic properties. Investigations of the linear optical properties allow comparison of experimental results with recent predictions of the electronic band structure and phonon spectra. Investigation of the transport, optical and structural properties aids in the identification of native and non-native defects of the unintentionally doped material, a first step toward control of the transport properties for optoelectronic applications.<br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. It should benefit society in expanding the knowledge base for exploration of new materials of potential interest in the development of new technologies. The research is of broad interest to the condensed matter physics and materials science communities and promotes the education and training of graduate and undergraduate researchers. The participation of undergraduate researchers will be particularly strong, involving students from Case Western Reserve University and John Carroll University. Focused efforts will be made to recruit underrepresented minority students. Research results will be broadly disseminated through scientific publication and participation in conferences and public lectures.
1008092	Stability and macroscopic properties of heterogeneous media	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	08/01/2010	08/08/2012	Yury Grabovsky	PA	Temple University	Continuing grant	Eugene Gartland	07/31/2014	$320,077.00		yury@temple.edu	3340 N. Broad Street	PHILADELPHIA	PA	191405104	2157077379	MPS	1266	7237	$0.00	Grabovsky<br/>DMS-1008092<br/><br/> The investigator studies problems related to composite<br/>materials, martensitic phase transformations, and morphological<br/>stability in materials. First, he considers exact relations and<br/>links for effective tensors of fiber-reinforced elastic<br/>composites, by applying the general theory developed by him and<br/>his collaborators. The general theory provides a strategy for<br/>finding every relation and link. However, the actual execution<br/>of that strategy is far from trivial. The case of<br/>fiber-reinforced elastic composites is both important for<br/>applications and incredibly challenging technically, because the<br/>microstructure is two-dimensional while the properties of the<br/>composite are represented by three-dimensional fully anisotropic<br/>elastic tensors. This topic builds on the successful solution of<br/>a similar, simpler problem in the context of Hall-effect<br/>conductivity. A second problem concerns morphological stability<br/>of phase boundaries in materials capable of undergoing<br/>martensitic phase transformations. The investigator studies the<br/>possibility of a configuration in which the only mode of<br/>instability is the global motion of the phase boundary. <br/>Mathematically this corresponds to the failure of the generalized<br/>second variation to stay positive. The difficulty is that all<br/>other stability criteria are required to be satisfied. The<br/>resolution of this issue opens the way to a complete<br/>understanding of all instabilities of configurations with smooth<br/>phase boundaries. In the context of periodic composites,<br/>morphological instabilities may occur locally within a period<br/>cell. Their interaction with the effective behavior of a<br/>composite is investigated, following prior work for structural<br/>and material instabilities. <br/><br/> Heterogeneous media, or media with internal structure, are<br/>of great importance in applications. Composite materials, which<br/>have by now become ubiquitous, are one example. Another example<br/>is shape memory alloys and other smart materials. These two<br/>groups of materials are very different, yet have some important<br/>common features. A well-known connection between the two<br/>theories can be used to shed light on the less well-understood<br/>theory of martensitic phase transformations responsible for much<br/>of the shape memory behavior. One aim of this project is to<br/>understand elastic properties of fiber-reinforced elastic<br/>composites. Such composites may combine two cheap but imperfect<br/>materials to produce a new material that is either rare or not<br/>found in nature at all. For example, modern skis use composites<br/>to create a material that bends easily but is incredibly stiff<br/>with respect to torsion. However, there are limitations to what<br/>can be achieved by composites. The investigator maps out those<br/>instances where the benefits of creating composites are<br/>dramatically reduced due to the presence of exact relations,<br/>i.e. relations between material moduli that cannot be altered by<br/>making composites, no matter how hard one tries. The present<br/>work focuses on a very widely used class of fiber-reinforced<br/>composites. Another aim of the project is to understand<br/>instabilities in models of non-linear elasticity and shape memory<br/>alloys. One widely known type of elastic instability is<br/>buckling. Martensitic phase transitions responsible for shape<br/>memory behavior are another kind of instability. These examples<br/>show how important instabilities are in applications. The<br/>investigator classifies all possible instabilities in a<br/>systematic way, with the secondary goal of solving one of the<br/>long-standing mathematical problems: finding correct sufficient<br/>conditions for stability.

As with previous years, the participants include seasoned researchers, new investigators, and graduate students. The mix of experience and cultures enables an open and lively exchange on climate science.<br/><br/>The U.S. is the international leader in funding for paleoclimatology and this is reflected in the strong representation of U.S. instructors in the summer school. The representation of U.S. graduate students, however, is lower than that of other countries. This leads to an imbalance among U.S. beneficiaries of the knowledge transferred during the course. <br/><br/>The purpose of this award is to enable greater attendance by U.S. students in the summer course with the ultimate goal of providing early-career U.S. graduate students with a three-week residential immersion course in state of the art techniques for data analysis and modeling used in the reconstruction of Earth's climate. <br/><br/>Support for the Urbino summer course helps foster a network of future researchers who are better connected, globally. This is important because paleoclimatology is a global science that needs data from across geographic boundaries.

The main objective is to develop an understanding of fundamental excitations in dispersive fluids which are physically relevant for a number of systems including Bose-Einstein condensates, optics, plasma, and shallow water. Such excitations include oblique dispersive shock waves which will be constructed for a number of nonlinear dispersive wave equations. Properties, including stability and the behavior of interacting dispersive shock waves, will be investigated and applied to the study of multidimensional boundary value problems.<br/><br/>Thunder, the crack of a whip, and the boom heard from a jet plane surpassing the speed of sound are familiar occurrences in human experience and all result from the generation of viscous shock waves. This project will focus on a very different type of shock wave that propagates through dispersive media such as the superfluidic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), nonlinear photonic crystals, plasma, and shallow water. Applications of this theory include the control of nonlinear waves, fostering advances in modern technologies such as matter lasers, atomic interferometry, and imaging.

When a given group acts, what can be the geometric and topological properties of the underlying manifold? The PI's work focuses on these questions in the setting of pseudo-Riemannian metrics and conformal structures.<br/><br/>The proposed research draws from three active branches of mathematics: <br/>differential geometry, dynamics, and Lie groups. The objects of study, pseudo-Riemannian and, in particular, Lorentzian metrics, arise in general relativity. The spacetimes of interest to relativists are noncompact, but they often consider conformal compactifications. Isometric or conformal automorphisms are important in the search for models of spacetime, because they simplify the background partial differential equations, and they correspond to conservation laws.

With support of this award from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation, Professor Richard Hsung's research group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison intends to develop asymmetric intramolecular cationic [2 + 2] cycloadditions using chiral Fe(III) catalysts or chiral Br¯nsted acids, and to design temporary tethered systems for achieving an equivalent of highly regio- and stereoselective intermolecular cycloaddition. An ultimate goal is to feature the cationic [2 + 2] cycloaddition in a total synthesis of natural product, (-)-bielschowskysin, that possesses anti-cancer and anti-malarial activities. Achieving a cationic [2 + 2] cycloaddition will lead to a bio-inspired strategy for synthesizing cyclobutanes, and will allow Professor Hsung's program to significantly impact an area of cycloaddition chemistry that is under-explored and contribute to the field of asymmetric catalysis in areas of chiral Fe(III) reagents as well as Br¯nsted acids. <br/><br/>Designing and developing new methods that can serve as approaches for rapid assembly of complex structures and efficient strategies for constructing natural occurring substances that possess important biological activities remain as one of important quests in modern organic chemistry. With support of this NSF award, Professor Hsung intends to build a research program based on this premise while focusing on a [2 + 2] cycloaddition manifold en route to cyclobutanes, a four-membered all-carbon containing ring that represents a prevalent motif among medicinally useful entities. In addition, all projects proposed here concern various aspects of basic organic chemistry. Thus, they provide a unique opportunity for teaching undergraduate students to develop useful synthetic methodologies based on fundamental concepts, structural designs, and proposed mechanistic models. By accomplishing these objectives, Professor Hsung's research efforts will continue to broaden the impact of synthetic organic chemistry on training and education.

To meet the demand for highly skilled technical labor and to stimulate the further development of a tropical ornamental mariculture industry in Florida, Florida Keys Community College (FKCC) proposes the development of a Tropical Ornamental Mariculture Technician (TOMT) certificate. The certificate requires completion of 27 credit hours of in class course work, laboratory and field studies. The capstone course for the certificate is an internship at one of four tropical ornamental mariculture facilities in the Florida Keys (South Eastern Aquatechnologies, Inc., The Coral Restoration Foundation, Mote Tropical Research Laboratory, and Atlantic Reef Aquaculture) working with research and production of marine ornamental aquaculture organisms. The proposed Tropical Ornamental Mariculture Technician Certificate will provide a needed educational platform for the development of well-prepared technicians necessary for growth and development of the marine ornamental mariculture industry and marine conservation efforts during the 21st century. The proposal team is composed of experts in the fields of Marine Biology, Fisheries Science, Biological Oceanography (emphasis on Marine Community Ecology & Fishery Management), Aquaculture and Veterinary sciences. In addition to scientific knowledge, graduates will gain a thorough knowledge of the business environment associated with the aquaculture industry. The types of modular tropical ornamental mariculture systems employed during the proposed project are ideally suited to small business development and, therefore, may have substantial impacts on the local and regional economies.

No solution today can administer the benefits of clinical therapy in real-world situations. Altered auditory feedback (AAF) devices are the only solution available outside of clinics; but they are detached from clinical therapy. These devices suffer from four major problems: (1) prohibitively high cost of AAF devices; (2) fixed parameters that work only for one therapy technique; (3) cannot record user's voice in real world situations for analysis by a speech therapist; (4) inability to segment the user's voice from background noise. The intellectual merits of the proposed approach are that a solution is available through which clinical therapy can be administered in real-world situations, running on widely-available Bluetooth headsets thus dramatically reducing cost and bringing solution within reach of everyone. The algorithms will allow the technology to be used for clinical therapy and will also provide metronome capabilities. <br/><br/>Stuttering is the most prevalent fluency disorder; more than three million suffer in America. AAF devices do not always provide long term improvement, are tested only in clinics and shown to help only one third of the people who use them. Clinical therapy is the only solution for long term improvement, but no device can provide it in real-world situations, today. The proposal aims to assist patients; through a solution that is designed specifically to aid in real-life environments and can be used with any clinical therapy technique. It has the potential to play a critical role in mitigating the documented problems. The primary market consists of those who stutter. The market also includes speech therapists that can use this solution to administer their therapy techniques, for more efficient and sustained long term improvement in stutter. If successful, the societal impact of this project could be significant; as there are currently no known affordable treatment devices to address stuttering.

BOX 400195	CHARLOTTESVILLE	VA	229044195	4349244270	MPS	1267	9251	$0.00	The proposed research concerns low-dimensional topology, specifically geometric classification of topological 4-manifolds and certain aspects of quantum topology. Krushkal proposes an approach to solving the topological 4-dimensional surgery conjecture in the context of the homotopy A-B slice problem. A convenient framework for this approach is provided by topological arbiters, a notion recently introduced in collaboration with M. Freedman. The project includes a number of problems in quantum topology, specific questions concern spin networks, and as a special case a categorified relation between the chromatic polynomial of planar graphs and the Temperley-Lieb algebra. The project also aims to use topological methods to address classification problems for free and certain classes of interacting fermions, an important class of systems in condensed matter physics.<br/>Topological invariants have played an important role in recent work on classification of gapped phases of non-interacting fermions by Kitaev and others. K-theory and Bott periodicity turned out to be crucial ingredients in classifying systems with various symmetries. Krushkal plans to work on a number of related problems, including invariants of families of free fermions and extensions to certain classes of interacting systems.<br/><br/>One goal of the project concerns classification of possible large scale shapes of objects that locally look like the Euclidean space. The classification of three- and four-dimensional shapes is a particularly important and challenging problem. This project is aimed at a better understanding of 4-dimensional objects with large fundamental groups, which contain many loops that cannot be contracted. Another part of the project concerns quantum topology, a subject influenced by ideas from both physics and mathematics and connected with statistical mechanics, representation theory, topology, and combinatorics. In particular, the goal is to gain a new conceptual perspective on spin networks, a notion whose origins are in quantum physics, in the recently developed mathematical framework of categorification. The third part of the project explores interdisciplinary connections between Topology and Condensed Matter Physics, focusing on topological insulators. This research, in collabor ation with physicists, will build on recent advances in classification of this remarkable class of physical systems.

As a result, organisms have developed behavioral and physiological mechanisms to adjust to limits in element availability and grow successfully in the face of nutritional challenges. Like organisms, social groups that collect and store food must also adapt to changes in nutrient availability. This study focuses on how a complex social group, the leafcutter ant colony, uses behavioral strategies to integrate intake of these elements with colony growth. Because social insect colonies must allocate effort to both foraging and brood care, colony growth and success depend on balancing work allocation across activities. This study will employ biochemical and behavioral techniques to determine how relative balances of these three key elements affect colony growth, as well as foraging and brood-care decisions by the individual workers within colonies. It is expected that colonies will respond to limitations by altering growth patterns and shifting efforts between tasks to balance different tasks associated with colony maintenance, growth, and reproduction around nutrient availability. The findings will integrate our understanding of how fundamental biological properties such as growth scale across levels of organization, especially in complex social groups like the social insects. Social insects are paralleled only by humans in their social complexity and level of organization. Thus, they serve as a relevant model to address the question of how resources and social organization are integrated. This research has broader impact in student training and outreach. Multiple undergraduates will be involved in the project through hands-on research and will participate in an associated seminar: the majority of students move on to the Ph.D. or other postgraduate training. The research will be featured in public educational outreach including the Ask-A-Biologist website (askabiologist.asu.edu) and local K-12 demonstrations.
1006322	Smooth 4-Manifolds	DMS	TOPOLOGY	06/15/2010	04/03/2012	Ronald Fintushel	MI	Michigan State University	Continuing grant	Joanna Kania-Bartoszynska	05/31/2015	$235,073.00		ronfint@math.msu.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	East Lansing	MI	488242600	5173555040	MPS	1267		$0.00	One of the central problems of low-dimensional topology is the classification of smooth simply connected 4-manifolds. In this direction, a basic question is whether any topological simply connected 4-manifold which admits a smooth structure in fact admits infinitely many. The PI's previous work with R. Stern developed a technique called 'reverse engineering' which can be used to attack this problem. This technique depends on the existence of 'model manifolds' or equivalently the discovery of embedded nullhomologous tori on which surgery can be performed. Until recently, there have been no explicit techniques for finding such tori. However, in the past year, R. Stern and the P.I. have discovered techniques for finding these tori in standard 4-manifolds. This proposal explains how this is done in (2 or more) blowups of CP^2. The embedded nullhomologous tori which are produced can be surgered to create infinite families of homeomorphic but mutually nondiffeomorphic 4-manifolds. The next task is to carry out Floer homology and relative Seiberg-Witten calculations so that our technique can become useful in its most general form.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this proposal will address the relationship between mathematics and theoretical physics, opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in topology, and career development of postdoctoral fellows. Four-dimensional geometry and topology has very close ties to physics. For example, the proposer will study geography problems for symplectic manifolds which have been shown to impact physics via the notion of 'superconformal simple type'. Any general results concerning Seiberg-Witten theory hold the prospect of engendering interaction with the physics community, and this will be a basic concern. The search for exotic 4-manifolds has been embraced by the theoretical physics community, and new results on this front will also serve to enhance this relationship. Another basic goal of this proposal is to address 'pipeline issues' in mathematics. Our approach is to to get students and young mathematicians working on interesting problems. A key aspect of this proposal is the development of problems which are accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students. It presents problems which will be suitable thesis problems for students and research projects for postdoctoral fellows at Michigan State. It also discusses computational problems which are suitable for advanced undergraduate students.

They must not only survive as fighting forces, but the stronger they are, the better the political bargain they can negotiate with the state. In the absence of lootable resources, rebels acquire resources either through symbiotic exchange with civilian supporters or coercive extraction from civilian populations. How and why rebels structure their relations with civilians differently is not well understood. <br/><br/>In this model, rebels are treated as policy-seeking organizations that optimize over their ideological goals and organizational needs. In this, they face many of the same challenges as states, and how rebels meet this challenge has ramifications for rebel-civilian relations. Rebels can appeal to external parties -- foreign powers, diasporas, transnational religious movements -- or local citizens for resources. <br/><br/>Balancing goals and needs is a difficult political reality.  Rebels may be forced to compromise some of their goals in order to increase their resources.  The closer these resultant goals are to civilian preferences, the better governors rebels will be. Good governance can comprise political/ideological representation, as well as some public services -- including protection, and up to and including the full range of social services normally provided by states.  Overall, rebel groups with domestic sponsorship are expected to provide the best governance, those with religious/ethnic diasporic support to be next-best, followed by foreign state sponsors, and finally extreme transnational movements.<br/><br/>Leveraging the comparative power of a natural quasi-experiment in Mindanao (in the south of the Philippines), this project outlines how rebels forge relational contracts at home and abroad, and how they shape the pattern of rebel governance on the ground.  This project uses qualitative and quantitative data to compare how Mindanao's three separatist movements respond to different strategic environments, as well as how rebels' behavior shifts over time, and from village to village. The study utilizes an extensive survey of Mindanao's conflict-affected areas, as well as extensive qualitative interviews to compare and outline how rebel groups provide governance.<br/><br/>Existing studies of rebel governance fail to adequately explain variation among groups, and/or limit the role of either international or civilian actors.  This project contributes theoretically to the study of insurgency by developing a model that includes the preferences and actions of both domestic and international actors.  Empirically, this project uses within-case variation in one of the longest-running and most under-studied rebellions in the world.  Leveraging within-case variation holds constant a range of socioeconomic and cultural variables that often bedevil cross-national comparisons of rebels' local behavior. <br/><br/>A better understanding of how rebels build and establish governance not only can inform more appropriate security and humanitarian programs, but also can suggest ways that political settlements might incorporate and make more transparent existing infrastructures--making peace more likely to last on the ground. Historically, many peace agreements have failed to percolate to the ground. Identifying parallel forms of governance, how they work, what benefits they provide, and why they vary can allow more effective integration into post-conflict stabilization efforts.

The geological record shows that this global-scale change, during which compasses everywhere go from pointing north to pointing south (or visa versa), takes only a few thousand years to occur. An especially interesting aspect of polarity reversals is the speed at which the field can change direction during the event. Controversial evidence from 16 million year old volcanic rocks in Oregon suggests that the ancient field changed as rapidly as 6 degrees per day, a rate that difficult to reconcile with standard estimates of several key deep earth properties. The goal of this study is to critically test an interpretation of new data representing just the second example of rapid transitional field change from the geologic record. <br/><br/>This study focuses on stack of 15.2 million year old lava flows exposed in the Sheep Creek Range (North Central Nevada) that happened to erupt, cool, and became permanently magnetized parallel to earth's magnetic field during a reverse-to-normal polarity switch. One flow from high in the stack has an unusual composite magnetization recording two geomagnetic field direction over 50 degrees apart. We interpret this composite magnetization to be the result of a two-stage cooling process during which the geomagnetic field changed rapidly (at least 1 degree/week) to produce the two magnetization components. To confirm our interpretation, better constrain the rate of field change, and more fully understand its geomagnetic context, we are investigating how the composite magnetization of this flow varies laterally and will determine how strong the geomagnetic field was before, during, and after the interval of rapid directional change. The outcome of the study will sharpen our understanding of deep earth processes and properties as well as provide a glimpse of the environment that future generations will experience when the earth's magnetic field next reverses polarity. In addition to the scientific goals of the project, the research is supporting the training of undergraduate students and providing opportunities for them to conduct research projects, is contributing to the broadening of participation for underrepresented groups in the earth sciences, and is contributing to research infrastructure at Occidental University.<br/><br/>The research is being supported by the EAR Geophysics Program and the EAR Education and Human Resources Program.

With the support of this award from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation, Professor Michael Haley of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon will explore the development of facile synthetic methods for the assembly of functional molecules comprised of benzene and acetylene building blocks. The study of such molecules answers fundamental questions regarding the electronic structure of organic (carbon-based) materials, and also presents opportunities for practical applications, particularly in the area of nanotechnology. <br/><br/>This project serves as an excellent training ground for graduate and undergraduate researchers in fundamental and applied chemical synthesis. The studies will provide the researchers with broad experience in organic synthesis, computational chemistry, x-ray crystallography, and fundamental aspects of aromaticity, electron delocalization, and molecular architecture. The broader impacts of this program include industrial internships of graduate students at local and regional companies and national labs, the exchange of graduate students with those of foreign collaborators in Germany, Denmark, and Japan, the hosting of extended stays of visiting scientists including professors from PUIs, and continued substantial involvement of undergraduates in state-of-the-art chemical research via programs which promote the participation of underrepresented groups.

The projects cover a range of topics including studies of graphene, nanotubes, semiconductors, metals, interfaces, superconductivity, magnetic systems, and molecular junctions. The major objective is to explain and predict the properties of materials. These areas are addressed using previously developed and ongoing enhancements to theoretical and computational techniques based on quantum theory. These techniques enable accurate calculations for real materials. In particular, the ab initio pseudopotential method and total energy techniques are applied within the density functional formalism to compute ground-state properties. Excited-state (spectroscopic) phenomena are investigated using a first-principle self-energy approach based on the GW approximation for quasiparticle excitations and an ab initio two-particle Green's function method based on the Bethe-Salpter equation for optical excitations. Other studies rely on molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, dielectric function methods, BCS theory, density functional perturbation theory, and extensions of standard many-body theory. Augmentation of existing methods to deal with electron correlations and localized methods are also employed. Close collaborations with various experimental groups are an essential component of this research activity. Past successes include accurate predictions of properties and the existence of new materials including nanostructures, and electronic structure calculations which allow band gap engineering approaches for technology. <br/><br/>The present effort extends existing research and adds several projects related to understanding and predicting the properties of graphene systems, nanotubes, and related nanostructures; electronic and structural properties of semiconductors, metals, and novel materials; quasiparticle excitations, excitonic effects, and optical responses of materials and reduced-dimensional systems; electron transport through molecular and nanoscaled junctions; superconductivity, electron-phonon interactions, and related phenomena. The research, though basic, supports further development of advanced materials, especially those relevant to semiconductor technology and nanoscience. The broader impacts of the effort include the education and professional training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, as well as the development of computer codes that can be used by many physics and chemistry researchers and by engineers for applications. <br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research and education in condensed matter physics and computational materials science. The projects cover a broad range of topics including the fields of high performance materials and nanoscience. The research will contribute to the development of theoretical and computational techniques based on quantum theory to enable accurate calculations of measured properties as well as the prediction of the characteristics and the existence of new materials that were not previously created in the laboratory. These techniques have high reliability because the computations are based on theory developed from basic principles of physics. Specific projects include those related to understanding and predicting the properties of exotic materials such as graphene (a two-dimensional, single layer of carbon) and nanostructures (structures that are some 100,000 times smaller than the human hair) and semiconductors important for technology. The properties of interest include characteristics related to how materials interact with light (such as absorption and emission), material strength, and electrical properties, to name a few. <br/><br/>The project is well suited for involving graduate students and researchers just beyond their graduate degrees, hence, it will significantly contribute to the education and training of a scientifically capable workforce. The theoretical work bears directly on experimental studies resulting in frequent experimental-theoretical collaborations on basic and applied science.

One of central topics is the study of increasing stability of the continuation of (acoustical and electromagnetic) waves. Another central topic is about uniqueness, stability, and methods of reconstruction of obstacles from boundary or scattering measurements, with emphasis on practical situations (in particular, on use of several frequencies or time data). The proposed research on drift-diffusion equations is concentrated around evaluation of doping profile in semiconductors and protein region in ion channels, as well finding volatility of option markets. The PI plans to obtain Carleman estimates for hyperbolic systems of anisotropic (including transversely isotropic) elasticity. All these research areas are challenging and central in applied mathematics. He will continue working on outstanding analytical problems, like uniqueness in the three-dimensional inverse conductivity problem with local data. Energy (including Carleman) estimates, harmonic and micro local analysis and potential theory will be main tools of this research. <br/><br/>The research on increasing stability of continuation and of locating obstacles is crucial for enhancing resolution of remote sensing in a variety of civil and military applications. Finding the doped area of semiconductor devices is of value for quality control in computer industry, and monitoring of ion channels is of fundamental interest in biology and medicine. The study of nondestructive evaluation of elastic properties is quite important in aviation, car, and construction industries, geophysics, and medicine. The PI will train graduate students preparing them for challenges of science and industry. Goals of this project have important applications to engineering, geophysics, and medicine.

The small business has previously developed patented inks based on electrochromic nano-pigments and a compatible ion-conductive adhesive, which are designed to be coated with conventional manufacturing equipment to produce flexible electrochromic devices, such as window films that change reversibly from dark to clear upon the application of 1.5V potential. While functional electrochromic films have been produced in the laboratory, attempts to scale to commercial manufacturing have been frustrated by agglomeration of nano-pigments in the inks over time. Various additives will be evaluated in these inks, to result in an electrochromic ink formulation suitable for manufacturing trials. This project will also explore ionic interactions with the surface of nano-particles buried within a polymer composite. The technical insights from this project may also have applicability in other technologies driven by ionic absorption / desorption.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project springs from the invention of a new material that enables the production of light-weight, flexible electrochromic devices. Potential applications include architectural electrochromic window film and automotive electrochromic window film. Broad market acceptance of these films would contribute significantly to energy savings.

Specifically, as the Director of Distributed Robotics Lab, the PI proposes to investigate a unified platform that will enable inputs from a human via an Android-based graphical controller to coordinate and control a team of cooperative UAVs. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposal involves the development of an algorithm for real time development of optimal quality of service solutions based upon the robot's current state and goal. If the algorithm is cooperative it would also enable multi-robot collaboration. <br/><br/>The proposal seeks to advance this research issue through extensive physics-based simulation. The broadest area of impact of this proposed work is the likely advances in multi-robot cooperation research, which will have clear benefits to society in disaster situations where time is of the essence. In addition, the plan that all development will be in standard languages using open source libraries and off-the-shelf operating systems increases the likelihood that others will be able to build from this work. The proposal also presents plans for actively recruiting minority and female students in the PI's laboratory. The proposed research will arguably promote collaboration between the PI's institution and several military centers.

Warr	06/30/2014	$120,008.00		dassow@uoregon.edu	5219 UNIVERSITY OF OREGON	Eugene	OR	974035219	5413465131	BIO	1114	1132, 7465, 9183, 1114	$0.00	Abstract <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>During cell division, the cytoskeleton reorganizes itself rapidly to align and separate chromosomes, and then cleave the cell in two. Cell division itself is mediated by contractile proteins, whose assembly is controlled by the signaling protein Rho. The mitotic apparatus, which sorts the chromosomes, is based on microtubules, and somehow provides the spatial information to pattern Rho activity, and hence contractile protein assembly, in space and time. A long-standing hypothesis proposes that molecular motors carry signals along microtubules of the mitotic apparatus to tell the cell surface where to contract. This project will directly test this hypothesis by investigating the quantitative conditions under which motors of the kinesin family can translate the information immanent within the rapidly-changing microtubule array into a pattern of Rho signaling at the cell surface. To do this, the investigators will create hybrids between motor proteins and photoactivatable fluorescent proteins and measure their biochemical properties. They will measure motor motility parameters by observing single motors attaching to and moving along single microtubules in vitro. These same hybrid motor probes will be introduced into cells, and live imaging will be used to measure their dynamic behavior during cell division at high resolution. Meanwhile, advanced 3D computer simulations will be developed to predict how these same quantified agents should behave in the context of the whole cell, either normally or when the geometry of the microtubule array is experimentally altered; in turn, assays in live cells will test these predictions. By combining live-cell imaging, single-molecule measurement, and computer simulation of hypothetical outcomes, the project will produce an account of the physically-plausible conditions under which the cell's toolkit of molecular motors and cytoskeletal assembly regulators could add up to a mechanism for robust spatial pattern formation during cell division. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/><br/>This project will train undergraduate and graduate students in high-resolution live-cell microscopy. The research also involves development of a sophisticated agent-based computer simulation program that is expected to have broad application to many other fundamental problems in cell biology, beyond the specific research goals of this project. This software and computer code will be made freely available to other researchers. Likewise, the research is expected to produce several useful molecular probes that will facilitate broader studies of the behavior of the cytoskeleton by other researchers. These probes will be distributed freely to researchers using Addgene.org, a non-profit plasmid repository which makes constructs available for the cost of shipping. Finally, this research will generate, as by-products of the specific experiments conducted, numerous microscope images and videos which the investigators will make freely available via both lab websites and public collections for educational and other research use.

Specific goals are to establish a physical model to predict preferential adatom incorporation on III-V semiconductor nanopillars, and to experimentally verify and optimize the formation and characteristics of the nanopillar structures. The project has three primary components: 1) experiment verifiable predictive physical modeling of 3D surface dynamics, 2) correlated nanopillar characterizations and analytical simulations, and 3) controlled preferential nanopillar epitaxy on predetermined sites. Unlike semiconductor nanowires grown using catalytic metal nanoparticles (e.g., Au), these nanopillars are grown without catalysts on masked substrates with lithographically defined nanopatterns. This approach obviates metallic contamination and provides nanopillar placement, along with subsequent device mask registration. Simulation of atomic surface dynamics, based on ab-initio density functional theory, Wulff's theory and integrated with elastic strain and thermal kinetics components, will be conducted to relate preferential adatom incorporation to nanopillar faceting, surface energy, and growth parameters. Correlated measurements of structural, compositional, electrical, and optical properties will be performed, and combined with mathematical simulation for extraction of nanopillar properties including surface state density, carrier dynamics, and quantum effects. <br/><br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. The materials and nanostructures being studied can potentially serve as basic building blocks for advanced optoelectronic devices. The project emphasizes integrated education and research in training of pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students through laboratory participation, complementary coursework development, and scientifically focused community K-12 involvement. Both PIs are strongly committed to inclusion and broadening participation of under-represented minority groups in undergraduate and graduate research. Support for undergraduate laboratory employment is budgeted and a plan is in place for focused recruiting through student URM (underrepresented minorities) societies and historically URM colleges, as well through the UCLA Center for Engineering Excellence and Diversity (CEED). Technology transfer is included through collaboration with several companies and national laboratories.

This will be achieved by developing a high-brightness infrared source that is heated to 2000 K by means of a diode laser. This will enable the instrument to be less bulky and expensive, and will have improved monitoring range over current systems.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to provide a solution that will reduce several limitations that are found in current OP-FTIR technologies, namely, elevated capital costs, size, power requirement, and/or sensitivity. The approach will broaden the use OP-FTIR for monitoring atmospheric gases by EPA and ASTM methods, and these benefits may help implement this technology and make it applicable for other applications such as closed path FTIR systems.

Such products would significantly enhance the educational and vocational opportunities of the blind. The Phase I research objectives include evaluating 3x3 tactile actuator matrices to determine their suitability for expansion to: a) a 36x12 matrix in a dynamic vibratory mode; and b) a full page Braille display in a static mode.<br/><br/>Additional objectives will include determining how this technology can be incorporated in products for blind people that provide access to text documents, graphs, maps, Internet, email, screen displays. The research will involve building and testing tactile stimulator arrays in vibratory and static modes to determine the: 1) capability to support the required amplitudes and forces; 2) dynamic power consumption; 3) required voltages; 4) scalability to the desired matrix size; and 5) manufactureability including cost and automation. The feasibility of high voltage drivers, and the incorporation of other components into the desired package will also be researched. The anticipated results will determine the feasibility of these revolutionary tactile display products for the blind.<br/><br/>The broader impacts/commercial potential of the research is based on providing technology that uses the sense of touch to substitute for, or to augment, vision and hearing. The most effective tactile display has been that in the Optacon, which consisted of a 24x6 array of piezoelectric reeds. Including the pins that contacted the finger, this array had 288 hand-assembled discrete components and 432 hand-wired solder joints on 6 overlapping planes. The result was an expensive to build display that consumed considerable space. EPAM technology promises to reduce the discrete components to a single monolithic polymeric sheet with individually addressable patterned areas, so cost and space are reduced while greatly improving manufactureability. Market segments for blindness products are schools and universities, state departments of rehabilitation, corporations, government agencies, private organizations, and individuals. A goal is to improve the potential commercial value in the blindness field by reducing the price so the individual market segment is larger. The societal impact in the blindness field would be in their increased employment and independence. The research would enhance scientific and technological understanding in the capabilities of the human sense of touch and how to build systems that effectively use it.

One explanation for this behavior is that it facilitates mate choice after copulation. Female choice that occurs after copulation is detectable because not all the female's mates have equal paternity; it is called cryptic female choice because the process is hidden. For example, females may transport sperm from particular males to storage sites near where fertilization occurs, which could result in paternity biased towards those males. Cryptic female choice can have profound effects on the strength and direction of sexual selection, the evolution of mating systems, and the coevolution of female and male reproductive traits that leads to speciation. However, the cryptic nature of postcopulatory female choice has made it extremely difficult to document. The PIs have developed a method to label live sperm with fluorescent particles so that the fate of the sperm can be observed in vivo. By observing both where sperm are stored and which sperm fertilize eggs, it will be possible to measure the extent of cryptic female choice. The work will be conducted with garter snakes and the methods are likely to be valuable for many species.<br/><br/>The PIs will develop and pilot an integrated inquiry-based lecture, field and laboratory unit appropriate for upper-level high school biology students. This program builds on a successful module that the PIs developed for middle-school students. The PIs also intend to sustain their commitment to undergraduate research opportunities by training at least two undergraduates in PCR, genotyping, and paternity analysis.

New proton exchange membranes with reduced vanadium permeability as well as enhanced stability and durability are needed for cost-effective operation of RFBs. The composite membrane to be developed will have high chemical stability in RFB electrolytes, high proton conductivity, and low permeability of vanadium ions, along with high dimensional stability, high mechanical strength, and high durability. The project will establish composition-processing-property relations of the novel composite membrane through detailed characterization. The performance of the membrane for vanadium RFBs will also be evaluated. Issues related to scale up of the membrane production will be identified and addressed. <br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project, if successful, will advance the development of RFB technology for stationary electrical energy storage. The feature of decoupling between the energy and power, and the extremely large capacities possible from RFBs make them well suited to use in large power storage and high output applications such as for transmission grid operations, in helping to average out the production of highly variable generation sources such as wind or solar power. RFBs'rapid response times also make them well suited to uninterrupted power supply (UPS) type applications.

Indeed cloud computing brings a host of new security issues that have not been addressed in the past research, namely the lack of trust between the infrastructure provider and customers (e.g., service providers) and potential for misuse of cloud computing resources for data exposure or service disruption. In this research, the PI addresses major security issues brought about by cloud computing. In particular, it plans to investigate underlying hardware/architectural mechanisms for three main issues related to cloud computing security: (a) simultaneous encryption and access control to protect service provider's data from infrastructure provider, (b) securing cloud resident data by scattering the data, meta-data, or encryption keys in the cloud, and (c) coordinated monitoring of both incoming and outgoing traffic of VMs in the cloud in order to detect any spyware installed in the cloud. <br/>The research could have a significant impact on providing security for cloud computing. The other broader impacts of the research include graduate student training and integration of the research findings into graduate courses. The scholarly discovery of this project will be disseminated broadly through publications and, where appropriate, technology transfer to industry.

Using stochastic Lagrangian techniques we will study the inviscid limit of the Navier Stokes equations in bounded domains. The probabilistic approach will allow us to address new questions (e.g. the asymptotic limit of the probability that a particle starting close to the boundary arrives in the interior of the domain). The project will also study probabilistic global existence theorems in the following sense: find a process whose expectation is a strong solution to the (deterministic) Navier-Stokes equations, and prove that for arbitrary initial data, the blow up time of the process is infinity with non-zero probability. A secondary aim of this research is to study the nonlocal, nonlinear PDEs associated with incompressible flows that promote the creation of hot spots.<br/><br/>The project will study mathematical aspects of fluid dynamics using probabilistic techniques. One fundamental, unresolved question addressed will be the separation of the boundary layer and the zero viscosity limit. This is of great practical interest in studying problems such as the determination of air flow about an airplane wing. Other problems studied are probabilistic global existence questions. While the question of existence for all time of solutions of the equations governing the evolution of incompressible fluids is unresolved, this project will address a probabilistic analogue of this question. Namely, can one find a criterion that allows one to decide that certain realizations of the flow are turbulent and stop them, and show that the remainder live forever with nonzero probability? A secondary aim of this project is to study certain peculiar stirring methods that keep the fluid hot (i.e. what is the best way to stir your coffee so that it is hot for as long as possible); this has applications to combustion processes, and chemical reactions.

Many of these applications exploit the ability to reduce the size of the relevant device features to micron dimensions and to tailor properties of the material by properly arranging ferroelectric domains. However, existing devices are based on bulk crystals or wafers with thicknesses of 0.5 mm or more. This limits the ability to produce devices that are more compact in size or are easily tunable in their function. This work aims at developing the materials foundations for new platforms with reduced dimensionality to overcome these limitations. The PI of this Materials World Network grant collaborates with two groups in Germany (Prof. Karsten Buse, University of Bonn and Prof. Detlef Kip, Helmut Schmidt University Hamburg) which are supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation). Through this international program, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral scholars acquire a unique perspective in interacting globally through travel exchanges and workshops involving all participating organizations. Undergraduate research and exchange is a strong element of this collaboration involving Lehigh's undergraduate students and targeting especially underrepresented students. The team also contributes to the Lehigh Science Outreach program by organizing annual outreach workshops for high school students<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The project focuses on the development of two novel material platforms: (1) The lithium-niobate-on-insulator platform (LNOI) utilizing 3 inch wafer-sized crystal slices and photonic wires with optical confinement below 1 micron. (2) Single domain nanocrystals in sizes between 10-100 nm. The multifaceted approach of the team spans from solving basic science questions about the changes in bulk properties due to the reduced dimensionality and the increased role of surfaces and interfaces, to the development of specially adapted methods for domain patterning and the alignment of ferroelectric nanoparticles, to the demonstration of devices such as a cw-THz source and other nonlinear frequency converters. The team exploits its expertise in the fabrication of wafer-scale lithium-niobate-on-silicon-oxide as well as in preparation of mono-disperse lithium niobate nanocrystals and will utilize surface sensitive characterization methods such as near-field UV-Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and low energy ion scattering. The possibility of manipulating the orientation of nanocrystals will be studied in a novel optical tweezers instrument, which allows 3D control of light polarization and in situ Raman characterization.

Hughes of the University of Vermont. This research involves carrying out novel synthetic approaches to carbon single-walled nanotube segments with specific and controllable structural parameters such as the length, diameter and chiral vector, or the orientation of the six-membered rings of carbon atoms relative to the axis of the tube. These approaches to the strained nanotube segments rely on the synthesis of planar, unstrained phenylene macrocycles containing alkyne or cyclopentadienone functional groups. These planar macrocycles will be synthesized and then additional phenyl groups will be added using a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The phenyl groups are introduced in an arrangement that will allow a subsequent oxidation reaction to fuse the rings together into the target tubular structures. Control over the diameter and length of the product nanotubes will be achieved by controlling the diameter of the precursor macrocycle and the size of the auxiliary phenyl-containing reactants. The strain inherent in the nanotube segments will thus be incorporated in a highly incremental fashion. Once synthesized, the solid-state packing and the conductivity of the nanotube segments will be evaluated. Chemical modifications of the segments will also be performed analogous to those currently carried out on larger nanotubes with less well-defined structures; such chemical modifications of these model systems will elucidate the chemical events taking place in the larger nanotubes.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are in part the training of graduate students in organic synthesis and characterization, and in the characterization of organic materials. In addition, the product nanotube segments are models of the larger carbon single-walled nanotubes currently produced with relatively little control over their diameters and lengths. The segments produced by the method proposed may be suitable as seeds for the production of large amounts of nanotubes with specific structures. Since the structure of the carbon nanotube affects its potential usefulness as a material for organic electronic applications such as field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes and photovoltaics, these smaller model systems could be used to further the understanding of the physical bases of these phenomena and could be potential feedstocks for materials in eventual devices.

The goal is a system to perform comprehensive pattern analysis of state-of-the-art biochemical separations generated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). A critical challenge for elective utilization of GCxGC-HRMS for biochemical classification and biomarker discovery is the diffculty of analyzing and interpreting the massive, complex data for metabolomic and proteomic features. The quantity and complexity of the data, as well as the large dimensionality of the biochemistry in which significant characteristics may be subtle and involve patterns of variations in multiple constituents, necessitate the investigation and development of new bioinformatics. The principal technical objective is an innovative framework for comprehensive feature matching and analysis across many samples. Feature matching is the basis for uniformly labeling structures so that similarities and differences can be documented. Specifically, the framework will incorporate advanced methods for multidimensional peak detection, peak pattern matching across large sample sets, data alignment, GCxGC-HRMS feature computations, and classification with large feature sets. The anticipated result is the technical foundation for a commercial system to classify biological samples and identify significant biomarkers.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be a better understanding of biochemical processes and discovery of metabolomic and proteomic biomarkers, leading to improved methods for disease diagnoses and treatments. These innovative bioinformatics will contribute to economic competitiveness in the global market for analytical technologies and will foster utilization of advanced GCxGC-HRMS instrumentation. The informatics developed in this project also will be relevant for other classification problems involving multidimensional, multispectral data, including other applications (such as biofuels),other types of chemical analyses (such as multidimensional spectroscopy), and other fields (such as remote-sensing multispectral geospatial imagers). The project will contribute to workforce development, by involving student interns in research experiences through internships and project sponsorships, and to education, by providing software and example data to allow students to more easily explore biochemical complexity.

The topics to be investigated are: small viscosity regime of second grade fluids; uniqueness of weak solutions for certain linear perturbations of the two-dimensional Euler equations; the vanishing viscosity limit of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with helical symmetry; the search for hypotheses on the structure of invariant measures or stationary statistical solutions of the two and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with anomalous dissipation; the search for energy cascade for flows in domains with physical boundaries; two-dimensional cascades with large gap bimodal forcing. Turbulence is a common phenomenon in fluid motion, in which macroscopic quantities (velocity, pressure, temperatures, etc.) no longer have a deterministic relation with global parameters of the flow. Direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows at large Reynolds numbers, that occur in practical applications, such as in geophysical modeling and mixing in industrial processes, are out of reach even for the state-of-the-art computer power. Therefore, there is an urgent need to pursue this challenging problem analytically, by developing rigorous mathematical and statistical tools to investigate it, and to test these tools computationally. <br/><br/>While turbulence is an everyday occurrence, our understanding is still lacking in many aspects. Quantifying the effect of small scales on the dynamics of large scales is fundamental in modern multiscale science. The goal of the project is to enable a predictive analytical study of turbulent flows. This study will impact wide-ranging applications, from geophysical modeling, such as dispersion of pollutants in the ocean, to biological and industrial modeling, such as design of polymeric materials. The project will consolidate the well-established collaborative efforts of the principal investigators with their Brazilian counterparts, and may lead to new collaboration, especially among the junior research personnel. International collaboration among scientists is a key to economic competitiveness in global markets. Four US and three Brazilian academic institutions are involved in the project. The international dimension of the project is further emphasized through two planned workshops. Training and supervision of at least six Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows is also achieved through planned summer schools and scientific workshops. Students and postdoctoral fellows from the US will travel to Brazil to participate in the workshops and the summer schools and interact with the US and Brazilian researchers.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded with the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering.

The scale of this oil spill, as well as the application of chemical dispersants to control it, is unprecedented; and its ecological impacts on the Gulf of Mexico are completely unknown. One issue of particular concern is the effect of surface oil slicks on the mortality rate of pelagic larvae of important fish and invertebrates, such as the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Blue crabs spawn in coastal waters, but larvae move offshore into the open marine environment where they pass through several larval stages before migrating back into the nearshore zone as megalopae to transform into juvenile crabs and settle into coastal marsh habitat. The pelagic larvae stages (i.e., zoea) are very sensitive to environmental stress and exposure to surface oil slicks and dispersant are highly likely to result in wide-spread mortality of blue crab larvae present. The location and size of the DpH oil slick currently in the northern Gulf of Mexico makes it highly likely that blue crab zoea will be exposed to either oil, dispersant or both and the objective of this RAPID project is to examine the impact of the DWH oil spill on blue crab settlement rates in coastal estuaries.<br/><br/>Dr. Fulford and colleagues will measure the settlement rates of blue crab megalopae along the Mississippi coast and compare settlement in 2010 to historical patterns of settlement at the same sites. In addition, a predictive hydrodynamic model will be used to correct observed settlement for hydrodynamic forcing so that settlement rates in 2010 can be compared to historical patterns with a focus on changes in larval mortality rather than larval dispersal. The project will also make use of blue crab zoea and megalopae from the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory (GCRL) blue crab hatchery to conduct a series of experimental assays to assess the mortality rate of blue crab zoea and megalopae in response to crude oil and dispersant. These assays will allow for a stronger interpretation of field data, as the PIs can compare observed concentrations of crude oil and dispersant in the open marine environment to assay results to state clearly whether any observed changes in megalopal settlement might be due to oil-induced mortality. The results of this project will be important as an assessment of the ecosystem impact of the DpH oil spill, as well as important baseline data for measuring ecosystem recovery.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>This project will also have important broader impacts as the data will be used to calibrate food web model s of the coastal ecosystem to impacts of the oil spill. These models will allow for a broader examination of the impacts on specific species at the scale of the entire ecosystem. Further, the results of this project will be combined with the results of a spatial examination of blue crab settlement being conducted at Tulane University by Taylor and the two projects will form the nexus of a larger project to examine regional patterns of blue crab recruitment in support of ecosystem-based management. Finally, the PIs will make use of a long-term dataset from GCRL on blue crab settlement in coastal marshes that has not been previously used or published in its entirety, thereby making the data more available to the scientific community. This project is being implemented by several early-career researchers who will be able to build on project findings to build their research programs.

This workshop, to be held in Beijing in October 2010, will address challenges for achieving efficient application performance on HPC systems. These challenges have grown, mainly due to the prevalence of multicore processors and acceleration hardware such as GPUs and the Cell processor. The common interests of Chinese and American scientists in responding to issues of application acceleration have been confirmed through collaborative workshop planning, and some face-to-face visits, but there are few regular opportunities for scholarly communication between US and China researchers on these topics. The workshop will bring US leaders in acceleration technologies to China for three days of scholarly communication and collaboration, with a specific goal of identifying mutually interesting topics for ongoing collaborative research projects. The workshop will include faculty, students, junior researchers, and senior researchers, with participants from underrepresented groups.<br/>Application acceleration in high performance computing is not a solved problem. Some of the same acceleration technologies used in new high performance computing (HPC) systems are found in today?s desktop and notebook computers, including GPUs and multicore processors. However, HPC systems are thousands of times larger, and the programs that run on them need more effective communication among the various components and methods for dividing the computation across the system, and other issues such as dealing with very large output and the potential for individual components to fail need to be addressed. The workshop will bring together experts from the two countries to share their views on the state of the art in application acceleration, with the goal of enhancing scientific discovery and analysis through high performance computing. After the workshop, the US and China participants will pursue joint research projects and scientific collaborations. This workshop is supported by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering with co-funding from the Computing and Communication Foundations Program of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate.

The innovation underlying this proposal is to integrate pedagogically sound training principles derived from intelligent tutoring system research into immersive environments to improve the understanding of physics concepts and principles in both teachers and students in high school and post-high school educational settings. An intelligent immersive environment will adapt its instruction e.g., differentially giving advice to students based on an assessment of their overall performance, to the individual learner thus improving the efficacy and efficiency of the instruction. <br/><br/>There is a growing scarcity of qualified science teachers and especially physics teachers at the high school level. The proposed activity will advance the education and training communities? understanding of intelligent instruction in immersive environments by creating an instance (i.e., a physics environment) which can serve as a foundation for future research. In addition, the innovation is a point solution aiming to improve science teacher?s understanding of physics concepts and principles to improve their own teaching endeavors. The initial solution will be fielded in San Antonio and the South Texas region, an area with a high Hispanic population. Upon refinement, the physics environment could reach traditionally under-represented populations who have limited access to master physics instructors. Locally, the proposed project will extend the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) relationships of the ongoing San Antonio Math Science Education Coalition (SAMSEC) involving business, secondary education, and post-secondary education organizations.

SF4 and SF6 would be created by mixing DUF4 with sulfur oxides and halides (and oxygen for SF6) at varying temperatures, pressures, and stoichiometries. In addition, the generated SF4 would be mixed at varying temperatures, pressures, and stoichiometries with NOF to try to create NF3. A two-step process to create NF3 with SF4, NH3, and fluorine will also be performed.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be the expansion of a market for nuclear waste by-products that is currently insufficient to utilize the existing supply of nuclear waste. By expanding the market, the potential to expand the nuclear power industry might be more palatable.

They will utilize a suite of proxies (microfaunal assemblages, stable and radiogenic isotopes, biomarkers, sediment mineralogy and elemental composition and grain size) to reconstruct variations in glacial inputs, sea ice, and water circulation. The use of paleobiological and geochemical proxies will be greatly enhanced by a unique sediment core that has a rich calcareous microfossil record extending through most of the Quaternary and potentially into the Pliocene, unlike other cores from the Arctic Ocean. This is a unique find that they can capitalize on as Arctic cores typically preserve calcareous microfossils only in Late Quaternary sediments. Age control will be achieved by paleomagnetic, 10Be, Sr-isotope, and cyclostratigraphic methods. This research will allow them to test whether there was an overall progressive growth in ice sheets and sea-ice cover and if sea ice and continental glaciers changed synchronously. They will also test whether the Mid Pleistocene Transition led to the growth of a super-thick Laurentide Ice Sheet by analyzing changes in glacial inputs from the northern Laurentide margin, with a multi-century scale record for the threshold glaciation ca. 650 ka, which initiated the icehouse world.

Furthermore, this project aims to design and deploy a community cyber-learning space where individuals and groups can publicize, share, and inspire creative robot applications. The plan for this Phase I component of the project is to create a working system - Brainlink, including a wireless tether module, a connector and communication standard that results from discussions with robotics companies, a software environment and an application sharing website. Once completed, this system will be tested with students in a month-long usage study and demonstrated to robotics companies to gauge interest in the resultant work.<br/><br/>The Brainlink system, if adopted by the robotics industry, will broadly impact both the personal robotics market and computer science and engineering education. Consider for a moment the implications significant adoption of the Brainlink system would have for computer science education. Past research suggests that many students desire for computer science education to be more application oriented and relevant. If successful, students as young as ten will be able to program their toys for specific applications relevant to their own lives. Furthermore, the system provides a practical venue for sharing applications; students may feel that their created applications are highly relevant if they can share them with millions of others. Economic impacts could be significant as well: Brainlink can act as a catalyst for growth in the consumer robot market. Though most consumers may not directly program their own robots, enabling all robots with Brainlink will allow these consumers to benefit from the applications created by an army of developers and students. These applications could greatly boost the entertainment, educational, and utilitarian value of robots generally and ultimately cause significant growth in this market.

A combination of in-situ wafer curvature measurements to probe dynamic changes in biaxial stress during MOCVD growth and post-growth transmission electron microscopy characterization will be emphasized. Initial studies will focus on investigation of compressive stress relaxation in InGaN grown on Ga-polar GaN on (0001) SiC substrates. The effects of N-rich vs group III-rich growth and intentional Si doping on stress relaxation, surface morphology and the structural and optical properties of the material will be studied early in the project. Comparable studies will then be carried out for N-polar InGaN/GaN grown on misoriented SiC. The project aims for identification and understanding of fundamental mechanisms of stress relaxation in InGaN, and the type and spatial distribution of resulting defects along with development of strategies to control stress and reduce defect formation. <br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. The results from the proposed study are anticipated to yield new insights into the mechanisms of stress relaxation and microstructure evolution in Ga-polar and N-polar InGaN layers that can be exploited for improvements in photovoltaic and solid state lighting performance. The project forms the basis of Ph.D. thesis work of two graduate students; undergraduate students will also be involved in the research through REU programs at Penn State. The project enables the PI and her graduate students to collaborate with members of the Penn State MRSEC Center for Nanoscale Science and personnel at the Franklin Institute Museum in Philadelphia, PA on the development of a cart-based interactive demonstration kit on energy materials. The PI will assist in the development of module activities that utilize light emitting diodes to convey technical concepts such as light emission from semiconductor materials, color mixing and solid state lighting. The museum show on energy materials will initially be developed for visitors of the Franklin Institute but will also be distributed nationwide to at least twenty other science museums.

The result is a significant shortage of computing research and teaching positions. Moreover, as our society faces challenges in energy, healthcare, education, and a host of other IT-reliant areas, the need for new talent grows. With fewer opportunities to obtain the intellectual renewal and diversity that promising new scholars can inject into institutions engaged in research and teaching, we risk creating a hole in the talent pool that will last for decades. This, in turn, puts at risk our nation's ability to use technological innovation for remaining globally competitive. Hundreds of our brightest and best-trained computing researchers are suddenly unable to find adequate opportunities to do advanced research and teach future generations. As a nation, we have invested time, energy, and funding in the training of these Ph.D.s. It is absolutely essential that we find ways to realize a payoff for that investment. <br/><br/>The Second NSF Computing Innovation Fellows (CIFellows) project will enable newly graduated computing Ph.D.s to obtain one-to-two year positions at academic institutions and industrial research organizations. It will support a new cohort of Fellows as well as second-year funding for many of the Fellows funded under the NSF Computing Innovation Fellows project last year. The aim is to forestall a permanent loss of research talent that is likely to occur if new Ph.D. graduates are forced to seek employment outside of the field due to the sharp cuts brought about by the continuing budget crisis. It will also allow new Ph.D.s to develop experience to make them more effective researchers and/or teachers.

It has long been assumed that the first and rate-limiting step of nitrification, ammonia oxidation, is restricted to a few groups within the domain Bacteria. However, the recent discovery of ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA) has seriously challenged our understanding of the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of nitrification in the ocean. <br/><br/>In this project, researchers at Stanford University and the University of Hawaii at Manoa will attempt to constrain quantitatively the contribution of marine Crenarchaeota to oceanic nitrification and investigate connections to other forms of nitrogen metabolism in the Gulf of California (GOC) and the eastern tropical North Pacific (ETNP). The specific objectives are to: (1) quantify 15N-ammonium oxidation rates, and bacterial and archaeal amoA genes and transcripts, at seven stations in the upper water column (0-100m) of the GOC and ETNP; (2) determine if Crenarchaeota are actively fixing inorganic carbon (i.e., autotrophic) based on uptake of 13C--labeled bicarbonate into archaeal membrane lipids; (3) quantify nitrite oxidation rates and nitrite-oxidizer abundances at the same depths and stations; (4) extend these measurements to multiple depths within the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ); (5) examine potential coupling between ammonia-oxidizing archaea and nitrogen loss processes in the OMZ of the GOC and ETNP, and (6) place our results in a broader oceanographic perspective by tying into NSF-funded work examining nitrogen fixation in N-deficient waters ultimately generated in OMZs. The researchers predict that marine Crenarchaeota will play a dominant role in ammonia oxidation-based on amoA abundance, gene expression, active fixation of isotopically-labeled inorganic carbon, and correlation to measured rates?in both the upper water column and OMZ. They also expect that metabolic coupling between AOA and both oxidative (nitrite oxidation) and reductive N metabolisms (e.g., anammox) will be apparent.<br/><br/>With regard to broader impacts, nitrification plays a pivotal role in linking organic matter mineralization to anaerobic nitrogen removal, and this project will provide critical information regarding how nitrification and the underlying microbial communities are influenced by key environmental gradients, as well as their connections to other N-cycling processes. Ultimately, this multi-disciplinary study should provide insights into the ecology and regulation of this biogeochemically-important process in all marine systems. The proposed research has excellent educational opportunities, and the PIs have a history of successfully mentoring and graduating Masters and/or Ph.D. students and fostering student publications and presentations at national meetings. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral education will be furthered through active participation in the cruise and post-cruise analyses, where students will work collaboratively with experts in molecular microbial ecology and stable isotope biogeochemistry, and learn a spectrum of state-of-the-art experimental and analytical methods.

Mirror symmetry has motivated many deep mathematical results and theories. In this project the PI will study various local and global problems of the geometry of these moduli spaces. These problems include the deformation of canonical metrics such as the Kahler-Einstein metrics and Bergman metrics with respect to various gauges. This study lead to a geometric quantization of the Weil-Petersson type metrics. The PI will also study the global properties of the period map from the Teichmuller and moduli spaces to the classifying spaces of variation of Hodge structures and their quotients. The PI will also investigate the geometric properties on canonical and new Kahler metrics on these moduli spaces as well as the general existence of Kahler-Einstein and Hermitian-Einstein metrics on noncompact manifolds and bundles over them.<br/><br/>Teichmuller and moduli spaces of Kahler-Einstein manifolds are important for both mathematics and theoretical physics. In string theory, many fundamental partition functions can be reduced to geometric or topological invariants of moduli spaces which also motivated many beautiful conjectures. The study of these important conjectures not only enhanced the development of various branches of mathematics but also help in verifying theory in high energy physics. The research of the PI also has potential applications in industry such as medical image processing and 3D cameras. For example, with the explicit construction of the period map the speed of compressing/decompressing pictures can be significantly increased.

At present, there is no demonstrated organic or inorganic resist that satisfies all of the requirements - high speed, low line-width roughness (LWR), sufficient etch resistance - for patterning devices at these feature sizes. A fundamentally new approach, relying on depositing extremely high-quality oxide films from aqueous solution and very efficient photon-induced network-forming reactions, is being pursued. The approach has enabled the production of extremely small feature sizes and linewidth roughness, enabling optimization within a uniquely high-performance triangle of sensitivity, linewidth roughness, and resolution. Resist deposition, resist formulations, exposure conditions, and processing parameters will be examined in detail to simultaneously address International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) roadmap requirements for 193i and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Anticipated results include 26-nm line/space (L/S) resolution at 3 nm LWR with 193-nm exposures and double patterning, and 22-nm L/S resolution at 1.2 nm LWR with EUV exposures. This resist platform will also lead to a high-resolution electron beam resist with unprecedented sensitivity.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project is to develop high-performance resist materials to fill critical unmet needs for semiconductor manufacturing with features smaller than 30 nm. The material being developed addresses two of the ITRS difficult challenges for lithography: an EUV resist that meets 22-nm half-pitch requirements, and the containment of cost escalation of the extension of 193 nm patterning. The resulting product will serve a quickly growing market with a combined opportunity of $250 million in 2015. Success in the project will have a considerable impact on continued productivity gains in the ITRS roadmap, which supports the electronics industry. New levels of device performance will be enabled, providing broad societal impacts through the introduction of advanced electronics, while enhancing prospects for domestic employment in advanced materials and semiconductor manufacturing. The broader scientific and engineering research communities will benefit from new techniques to build and study novel devices at the extreme end of the nanoscale. Finally, solution processing with aqueous materials will reduce the use of toxic solvents and permit a smaller carbon footprint from reduced reliance on vacuum process equipment.

In recent years it has become clear that the basic paradigm behind conditioning, the distance to good behavior, can be extended to a vast variety of problems, linking it in one general picture with the development of error bounds measuring the effect of perturbations and approximations of a problem on its solutions as well as with the convergence rate of algorithms. The good behavior of a problem is usually understood as a regularity property of a mapping related to the problem at hand which describes desirable features of its solutions. In this project we will extend the conditioning paradigm to broad classes of variational problems, including problems in nonlinear programming, calculus of variations, and optimal control. This task requires background work in the general area of variational analysis as well as the development of highly technical tools for tackling specific problems.<br/><br/>This project aims to establish theoretical foundations for conditioning of variational problems through rigorous analysis of regularity properties of mappings associated with such problems. The project will lead to a better understanding of the interplay between the theoretical features of a problem and the actual computation of solutions. Furthermore, it has the potential to have a direct impact on the scientific computing of variational problems, by providing tools for the development of preconditioning techniques and, consequently, new fast and efficient algorithms for solving large-scale problems that appear in science and technology.

However, its full potential in spacings and classification is yet to be fully explored. Motivated by several real applications, the investigator plans to: 1) develop nonparametric classification procedures based on DD (Depth-vs-Depth) plots. These procedures are referred to as DD-classifiers, and they are to be compared with the so-called support vector machine procedures; 2) use the multivariate spacings derived from data depth to: (2a) construct tolerance envelopes for functional or time series data and (2b) develop a class of multivariate goodness-of-fit tests.<br/><br/><br/>Classification is is an important task in all scientific domains, such as identifying new species in archaeological investigations or distinguishing disease types in medical studies. Applying the notion of data depth, the investigator proposes to develop effective classification procedures, which can automatically yield the best separating power for classification purposes and compete well with the highly calibrated existing classification procedures. The classification outcomes can be easily visualized in a two-dimensional plot regardless of the dimension of the data. The investigator also introduces multivariate spacings for the analysis of multi-dimensional data. These multivariate spacings should have a wide range of utilities. In particular, the investigator applies these spacings to develop both tolerance envelopes for tracking multivariate data and a class of multivariate goodness-of-fit tests. She plans to apply the proposed tolerance envelope to the monitoring of aircraft landing patterns and to ensure landing safety. She also plans to apply the proposed classifications to disease identification. These applications are motivated by the investigator's ongoing collaborative research projects with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Psychiatry of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. The proposed projects involve real databases and are ideally suited for engaging students and postdocs.

Potential feed stocks for cellulose include waste products like corn stover and sugar cane bagasse, or planting a specific crop of switch grass for harvest. Currently, the cost of cellulosic ethanol is too high for practical consideration. Environmentally friendly solvents, known as ionic liquids, have been identified for a pretreatment step in the production of cellulosic ethanol as a way to reduce the cost by making it easier for enzymes to break down biomass into fermentable sugars. Ionic liquids can be formally defined as salts that melt below 100 oC, and generally consist of a positively charged organic cation with a negatively charged anion. The solvation properties can be fine-tuned for particular applications depending on the cation/anion chosen. In recent years, ionic liquids have received a lot of focus because of the potential to develop environmentally friendly solvents. Some of the favorable characteristics include negligible vapor pressure, non-flammability, and thermal stability. The negligible vapor pressure is an important feature because of the reduced risk of respiratory problems compared to the fumes given off from traditional solvents. There is also a cost savings for industrial applications because it is possible to separate and recycle ionic liquids from other components in the process. Some important properties for developing more effective ionic liquids to be used in a pretreatment step include melting point, viscosity, and cellulose solubility. Both melting point and viscosity are essential because of process operating considerations. For example, the ionic liquid must be present in liquid form at the required temperature. Energy can also be conserved by specifically designing ionic liquids with a low melting point because a significant amount of heat will not be necessary. In a similar manner, ionic liquids with low viscosity will require less energy to pump and transport.<br/><br/>A computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) technique is being applied to help identify potentially new ionic liquids with favorable properties for more effective cellulose pretreatment. Applying this approach is much quicker, less expensive and allows for a more comprehensive search for the most suitable candidates. Currently, there are only a limited number of ionic liquids in the literature with cellulose solubility data, and thus, few options exist for the desired application.

The conference will be held between August 30 and September 3, 2010, in New Delhi, India. ACM SIGCOMM is the flagship annual conference of the Special Interest Group on Data Communications, a special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery. This award financially assists approximately 12 graduate students and 3 postdoctoral students from US institutions to attend this conference. Participation in conferences such as SIGCOMM is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, provides students with an opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and exposes them to leading edge research in the field. The award will enable people in the above categories to attend the main SIGCOMM 2010 conference, who would be otherwise unable to do so. The travel grant chairs are committed to encouraging the participation of women and under-represented minorities.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project proposes to provide travel support for US-based graduate and postdoctoral students to attend the main SIGCOMM 2010 conference. SIGCOMM is the flagship conference in the networking community and a highly competitive venue (with acceptance rate around 10%). Its rich program exposes participants to new ideas and cutting-edge research and allows for interaction between researchers from all over the world.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: First, this project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field. The proposed student participation is expected to have a positive impact on the students' research interests and quality. Second, the project will promote diversity by encouraging and enabling women and other under-represented minorities to participate. Furthermore, the truly international flavor of SIGCOMM as an annual conference is well-known and reflected in the composition of the Technical Program Committee (TPC) as well as in the authors of the submitted and accepted papers. As such, it cultivates international research interactions and presents a tremendous opportunity to students to increase their breadth of ideas, research approaches, and technical perspectives. Third, as part of this student travel grants program, the PIs are developing an online submission system, based on the widely successful hotcrp, which they will make publicly available for use in the community.
1008412	Coupled Systems and Applications	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	07/01/2010	06/22/2010	Martin Golubitsky	OH	Ohio State University	Standard Grant	Michael H. Steuerwalt	06/30/2014	$201,211.00		mg@mbi.osu.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	Columbus	OH	432101016	6146888735	MPS	1266		$0.00	The principal investigator and his students and collaborators study the dynamics of networks of systems of differential equations and their applications. Previous work identified when network architecture forces synchrony to be present in such systems (generalizing network symmetry to a combinatorial notion of a balanced coloring). Balanced colorings also lead to quotient networks and previous work also showed that robust phase shift synchrony can be associated to symmetry in a quotient network. These theories were motivated by studies of locomotor central pattern generators of animal gaits. The studies have progressed and several general questions are now studied like: Are all robust phase shifts present in periodic solutions of network equations the result of symmetry (using quotient networks), what are the patterns of oscillations associated with network architecture, and do these patterns always appear through bifurcation? (Surprisingly the answer to the last question is no; additionally, network architecture can change Hopf bifurcation in ways that transcend symmetry.) How network dynamics affects Takens reconstruction is studied (is it possible to reconstruct network dynamics from the output of one node) and the dynamics of small networks (can general network studies lead to a better understanding of motifs in Systems Biology) is studied.<br/><br/>The study of networks of differential equations is central to much of modern biology (from biochemical networks through protein interaction networks and gene transcription networks to ecology through food webs). Recent work by many research groups (usually based on chemical kinetics equations) has shown that network architecture does affect the kind of solutions that appear in coupled systems. Moreover, these solutions lead to function and to conjectures about how large biological networks work. General mathematical studies of network dynamics are providing both the tools needed to investigate more specific networks and an understanding of the kinds of phenomena that network models can produce. The project involves studying general theories for network dynamics, specific examples of networks that promise to yield new (mathematical) phenomena, and specific application areas (such as the ways in which sound waves are processed in the cochlear region of the inner ear, which in part is based on a network model of inner hair bundles).
1015805	Collaborative research: The community ecology of viral pathogens - Causes and consequences of coinfection in hosts and vectors	DEB	ECOLOGY OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES	07/01/2010	05/30/2014	Elizabeth Borer	MN	University of Minnesota-Twin Cities	Continuing grant	Samuel M.

The diversity (number and identity) of coinfecting pathogens can modulate both pathogen transmission among hosts and pathogen impacts on hosts. Nonetheless, little is known about the processes that govern pathogen diversity. This research will integrate field experiments and mathematical models to study the causes and consequences of pathogen diversity. The study consists of a model system of five viral pathogens of grasses (the cereal and barley yellow dwarf viruses). This approach will allow the investigation of the interacting roles of the pathogen species themselves, the insect vectors that transmit them, their plant hosts, climate conditions, and spatial processes in controlling the dynamics of systems that include multiple pathogen species. Further, it will elucidate the mechanisms by which pathogens interact, and evaluate the consequences of these interactions for pathogen transmission and host fitness. <br/><br/>This study will be of both scientific and societal significance. The work will advance the understanding multi-pathogen dynamics - a key step towards developing a comprehensive understanding of the ecology of infectious disease. It will include participation of under-represented groups, community outreach, and dissemination of results through both public talks and peer-reviewed journals. The investigators will integrate this research with education at both K-12 and university levels. The pathogens are among the most economically important viruses of crops, so this study may have benefits for agriculture. Moreover, these pathogens provide an experimentally tractable model for vector-transmitted generalist pathogens, the dominant type of emerging pathogen of humans, crops, and other species.

In these problems, data may be collected directly in the Fourier domain (as in MRI), or may be transformed into the Fourier domain for the purpose of image formation (as in X-ray Tomography or Electron Microscopy). In all cases, the image resolution is controlled by the largest wave-number present in the measured data. In order to minimize the distortion due to Gibbs phenomenon, current imaging methods either collect data in a large enough area of the Fourier domain or window the data to force an artificial decay. It can be shown that current methods require collecting more data than necessary or negatively impact the resolution near spatial singularities of recovered functions of interest. These singularities are, typically, the most informative part of the final image. In contrast, this proposal relies on nonlinear, near optimal approximation by exponentials to extrapolate the available Fourier data, also yielding a near optimal rational representation in space. This approach not only improves the resolution near singularities and achieves a near optimal performance, but also detects the level of noise in data and provides a practical technique for signal/noise separation. These new algorithms already yield a significant improvement over existing techniques in one-dimensional problems and this project intends to extend the approach to problems in two or three dimensions. Such an extension is highly nontrivial since the mathematical tools used in one dimension are only of limited use.<br/><br/>Inverse problems arise in a wide variety of scientific and engineering disciplines as a way to analyze biological or inorganic specimens, analyze manufactured devices for defects, perform remote sensing or geophysical exploration among many other applications. In all of these modalities, from processing multiple radar data to biomedical imaging such as MRI, the collected data is processed by algorithms implementing the solution of an inverse problem based on a specific mathematical model. The investigators propose a method of developing and algorithmically implementing new mathematical models applicable to many, if not all, of these problems. The reason for such wide applicability is the fact that in the new mathematical models the functions of interest are represented with a near optimal number of parameters, thus significantly improving the recovery of information from the measured data. The mathematical and practical significance of this project as well as its challenge lies in extending the methods developed by investigators in one dimension to multiple dimensions. Since techniques of non-destructive evaluation play a vital role in natural sciences, engineering, medical diagnostics as well as such visible applications as airport security, we expect a wide impact of these new mathematical models based on nonlinear approximations. The numerical methods developed within this project should provide scientists with computational tools to efficiently solve problems beyond the capabilities of many of today's algorithms.

This clock (located in a brain region called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN) has a well-defined structure that has many features that are conserved across mammalian species. The ways in which the complexities of this brain region contribute to the function of organisms are not fully understood. The SCN appears to have regions devoted to processing sensory input and generating rhythmic output. Using a gene-expression based approach, this project aims to distinguish the functions of these subregions of the clock and how they contribute to the overall function of the organism. It is anticipated that the results of these experiments will reveal novel information about how the structure of the biological clock relates to its function, and how different portions of the clock carry out different functions. This project will significantly impact our current understanding of clock function, which has common mechanisms in nearly all animals. Gene expression data will be deposited in the National Library of Medicine's Gene Expression Omnibus where it will be available to other researchers and the public.

The platform, referred to as Memory Based Multimedia Signal Processing (MBMSP), leverages on the fact that both nanoscale silicon as well as regular and periodic structures of many emerging nanoscale devices are amenable to dense, high-performance memory design. In MBMSP, algorithmic tasks are functionally decomposed into multi-input, multi-output functions, which are then mapped as lookup tables in a memory array and evaluated in a time-multiplexed, topological fashion using a small controller. This fundamentally different approach to information processing can be effective in developing a scalable platform with high-performance, reconfigurability, energy-efficiency and reliability for diverse and complex signal processing systems. The research seeks to develop circuit-µ-architecture-software co-design approach for MBMSP including software architecture to improve performance and scalability; circuit-µ-architecture techniques for memory cell and array to achieve low-power and robustness; software-hardware co-design approach for energy and reliability; and a Spin-Torque-Transfer Random Access Memory (STTRAM) based platform for scaling MBMSP to deep nanometer nodes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The MBMSP platform can potentially transform the traditional approach to design multimedia signal processing system. The research will integrate education through course module development and undergraduate research projects. The teaching modules will be adapted for the local high-school students, including about 40% minority/under-represented students, who join the pre-college program at Case Western Reserve University every summer. The modules will focus on hands-on learning approaches for multimedia/digital signal processing systems and new ways to design them. PIs will continue their involvement with Facilitating Academic Careers in Engineering and Science for African-American (FACES) and Summer Undergraduate Research Experience for minorities (SURE). PIs will mentor one SURE student every summer and involve them in the proposed research.

The first of these areas is a proposed exploration of a newly discovered connection between the (one-dimensional) Schroedinger's equation and the geometry of bicycle tracks. Schroedinger's equation is a fundamental model in many areas of mathematics, physics and engineering. Many physical phenomena, such as the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, the working of particle accelerators, and many more are explained by the properties of this equation. A completely different object of geometrical study--the so-called bicycle tracks--has been studied for over a century, with no apparent connection to Hill's equations. It was recently noticed by the PI that the two subjects are closely related. Part of proposed research is to exploit this relationship to gain new insights into both subjects. The second area of proposed research deals with systems with rapid imposed vibrations. Such vibrations are used in particle accelerators, in particle traps for low-temperature experiments and in laser tweezers. Underlying geometry of the phenomenon was understood only recently. The PI proposes to extend his earlier work to broader physical contexts, and to further explore the connection between differential geometry, mechanics and averaging theory in the context of this problem. This work is expected to show how concepts from differential geometry (curvature, normal family) find their manifestations in mechanics. In the third area of project, the researcher's goal is two-fold: first, to develop variational techniques for time--dependent Hamiltonian systems, and second, to shed new light on the problem of Arnold diffusion--an instability problem in Hamiltonian dynamics--in specific examples motivated by physics or geometry. <br/><br/>This project deals with three areas of mathematics arising in physical applications. The first part of the project is an exploration of a newly discovered connection between two fields which until recently seemed unrelated: Schroedinger's equation on the one hand, and the geometry of bicycle tracks on the other. The former describes the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, the working of particle accelerators, mechanical vibrations, and more. It was recently noticed by this investigator that the two subjects are closely related. This connection opens exciting prospects of each area giving new insights into the other. One such possibility is a striking connection between the motion of water waves on the one hand, and the deformation of tracks on the other. The second direction of proposed research addresses study of mechanical systems subjected to rapid vibrations. Rapid vibrations have found unexpected practical use in particle accelerators, in particle traps used for low-temperature experiments and in laser tweezers, the latter enabling biologists to manipulate parts of a cell by light, in an non--invasive way. The gist of a key phenomenon in this area was discovered in the investigator's earlier work. The present project aims to extend this work to wider applications, including fluids and gases subjected to rapid vibration, with applications including cooling, removing impurities from gases, affecting turbulence, and more. This project will apply tools of differential geometry and differential equations to better understand physical phenomena mentioned above. In the third area of project, the researcher's goal is two-fold: first, to develop variational techniques for analyzing time-dependent Hamiltonian systems, and second, to shed new light on the problem of Arnold diffusion--an instability problem in dynamics (e.g., of motion of satellites)--in specific examples motivated by physics and geometry.

First, the periodic problem for integrable differential equations will be revisited using this new approach, with the goal of obtaining a more efficient (from the point of view of asymptotics and numerics) answer than the current approach. Second, the PI and his students will use the new approach to analytically investigate the linear stability of different problems posed on non-standard domains such as the half-line or finite intervals with prescribed boundary conditions. In addition, the new formulation of the water wave problem due to Ablowitz, Fokas and Muslimmani will be used to initiate the solution of the inverse water wave problem: the problem of recovering the bottom topography using measurements of the water wave surface.<br/><br/>Using and expanding on new methods for studying problems with prescribed input at their boundaries, the PI and his collaborators and students will investigate problems describing a wide range of phenomena. Some of these application areas are relevant for waves on the surface of the ocean (tsunamis and rogue waves), while others impact engineering applications with wide sociological impact such as high-speed communication (nonlinear optics) or help with our understanding of current environmental problems (smog formation and dispersal). Lastly, the PI and his research group will initiate a new approach to determine the surface at the bottom of the near-shore ocean from remote sensing measurements of the surface. This work has direct commercial and defense naval consequences. The PI is committed to the training of the next generation of US scientists, on a local scale by working with students, and on a more global scale by preparing a text book describing the techniques used.

Using atomic-resolution electron microscopy, new insight into the atomic structure of the holes and defects in single-atom-thick BN sheets will be provided. The project will improve the understanding of the changes in current-conduction in these BN sheets in the presence of the holes and defects, allowing evaluation of their true potential for next generation electronics applications. This research will also be instrumental in determining the possibilities of using single BN sheets for filtration and biodetection applications. In addition to training graduate students, the education component includes improving and expanding the new courses on Electron Microscopy and Computational Nanomechanics, providing summer research opportunities for undergraduate students, and participating in outreach programs with local high school students. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: A systematic study the formation, mechanical stability and chemical reactivity of the nano-scale holes in the single sheet h-BN will be undertaken by combining several experimental imaging and spectroscopy techniques in scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) with theoretical predications based on calculations from first principles. Unlike conventional TEM imaging, the STEM probe electrons are scattered from the electrostatic potential of the atoms in the sample and recorded by a single-electron-sensitive annular dark field detector. This provides atomic-resolution images of the BN with direct and unambiguous atomic location identification. The spectroscopic analysis will be measured by electronic excitations inside single atoms of boron and nitrogen using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Theoretical predictions for the local density-of-states calculated for both atoms will be compared with EELS results; later, mechanical properties will be evaluated.

In other words, the project focuses on soliton theory for initial profiles that are much broader than rapidly decaying or periodic. It is well-known that slow decay at infinity may lead to new phenomena. For instance, certain smooth but slowly decaying initial data may turn into rough or even blow-up revealing a very complicated relation between local and global behaviors. Standard techniques of PDEs or numerical analysis are ineffective to tackle such issues. The IST is much better suited to study such phenomena as it combines both global and local properties of initial data, linearizes the problem, and provides accurate asymptotic behavior. Although the spectrum of the underlying differential operators (e.g. Schrˆdinger in the case of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation) is much more complicated than for the classical IST, it can be suitably expressed in terms of the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function which is well-defined for virtually any reasonable initial profile. The main thrust of this project is a study of the IST in this setting. In particular, the effect of different spectral components of the differential operator in the Lax pair on the solution of the corresponding nonlinear PDE will be investigated. <br/><br/>The inverse scattering transform was first discovered in the 60s for the KdV equation of shallow-water waves. Soon after, it was found for many other important nonlinear PDEs and now is regarded as a fundamental breakthrough in mathematics, connecting different branches of pure mathematics and theoretical physics, with numerous applications ranging from hydrodynamics and nonlinear optics to astrophysics and elementary particle theory. The importance of extending the range of validity of IST, which is the principal aim of the project, is recognized by both mathematicians and physicists. The results are expected to be of a very applied nature and could be employed for the study of wave propagation on different backgrounds (including noisy), tidal waves, certain meteorological phenomena, understanding freak waves or any other applied problems where initial data do not approach zero at infinity, and in such diverse disciplines as hydrodynamics, telecommunication, atmospheric sciences, nonlinear optics, plasma, astrophysics, etc. Given their remarkable pedigree, diversity of mathematics involved, and richness of applications, the topics of the project provide a great educational experience through research for the undergraduate and graduate students involved.

The intellectual contribution of the project stems from its work in two parallel domains, the first empirical, the second technological. On the empirical front, the project would likely be the first to experimentally assess the individual and combined impacts of content filtering, intelligent tutoring and physiologically-measured, gaming-induced learner engagement on speed to mastery. Technologically, the project would enhance the functionality of a learning content authoring, delivery and management system through the development of: 1) a predictive learner modeling subsystem running on a portable, extensible tool set that supports content filtering and intelligent tutoring, and 2) configuration parameters for a scenario-based gaming engine.<br/><br/>Learning acceleration is a fundamental and central, yet largely unattained, goal of the military, corporate and education sectors. While knowledge of the means by which learning speed can be increased is limited, there is solid agreement that major advances in learning acceleration are likely to be technology driven. The project will be conducted within the context of improving cybersecurity and cybersecurity education, thereby focusing on a threat of rapidly increasing magnitude to our national well-being and continued corporate success. Vast improvements in cybersecurity and cybersecurity training and education are widely believed to be necessary to protect the American way of life.

The goal of this project is to realize the selective growth of TMO nanowires without the assistance of catalysts, and study their electrochromic properties in applications of nanoscale smart devices with enhanced performance. The research activities in this project will allow participants to develop solid knowledge on fundamental science, accumulate experience with comprehensive research tools, and enhance their communication skills with experts in different research fields. This project also promotes current activities in the nanoscale science and engineering program and the emerging materials research at UNC Charlotte to create highly interdisciplinary environment for integrated research and education for both graduate and undergraduate students, including minority students. Research results will be broadly disseminated through conference proceedings and journal publications, and will be integrated into existing and new educational courses.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Selective growth of one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures is essential for large scale device integration, but so far the selective growth of 1D nanostructures is dominated by catalyst-assisted processes that are not suitable for electrochromic applications. This research project targets creating non-catalyst selective growth of TMO nanowires by surface nucleation control. The work will reveal the growth mechanism which will enable excellent controls on growth sites, orientation, alignment, and doping of nanowires for device fabrication. TMO nanowires are expected to have enhanced electrochromic properties in response speed and coloration efficiency with their reduced dimensions and enhanced surface area. The research activities will produce a fundamental understanding of electrochromism in nanostructures and establish the structure-property-performance relation for TMO nanowires to improve their electrochromic performance by fine structure controls. This research project will train both graduate and undergraduate students in multidisciplinary research topics such as materials synthesis and characterization, microdevice fabrication, electrical/optical property measurement, and electrochromic property testing.

Badecker	11/30/2012	$5,940.00	Ji Young Shim	mDen-Dikken@gc.cuny.edu	365 Fifth Avenue	New York	NY	100164309	2128177523	SBE	1311	1311, 9179, SMET	$0.00	This study investigates the linguistic nature of code-switching (CS), the concurrent use of more than one language in bilingual conversational speech. Patterns of CS are not random but systematic, which suggests the possibility that CS is constrained by grammatical principles that underlie human language. This research will investigate CS across languages that have different canonical orders of object (O) and verb (V). CS data show that not only can a switch occur across languages with different canonical word orders, such as an OV language like Korean and a VO language like English, but the internal order of a code-switched constituent may also vary, exhibiting either order of the two languages involved in CS. This project tests the hypothesis that OV-VO variation in CS is due to properties of particular verbs but also the meaning of the resulting phrase after the verb has combined with an object. The project will test the predictions of such a theory against Korean-English and Japanese-English bilingual speakers' introspective judgments of CS patterns presented to them in the form of a questionnaire. <br/><br/>CS has been extensively studied, yet there has been no single satisfactory account to explain the diverse, yet systematic, word order patterns found in various language pairs. By offering a unified linguistic account of certain word order variations in CS, this research contributes to an understanding of variation in bilingual speech and how it is regulated. The results of the study will also bear on several current proposals in theoretical syntax. Applying these proposals to bilingual speech is an innovative way to evaluate them. Lastly, this study will have a broader impact on various social and educational aspects. CS is often stigmatized and work on CS will help reduce such negative perceptions. This study will promote CS as a legitimate language form of bilinguals, which is subject to the same universal principles that govern monolingual speech.
1008209	Collaborative Research: Optimal Control of Multi-Input Mathematical Models for Tumor Dynamics under Combination Therapies	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	07/01/2010	06/22/2010	Heinz Schaettler	MO	Washington University	Standard Grant	Mary Ann Horn	06/30/2014	$171,605.00		hms@wustl.edu	CAMPUS BOX 1054	Saint Louis	MO	631304862	3147474134	MPS	1266		$0.00	One of the directions actively pursued in current cancer research is to combine traditional treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy with novel approaches such as anti-angiogenic treatment or immunotherapy in the hope of achieving synergistic effects. The underlying biological mechanisms of these novel approaches are not fully understood and several important questions including how to best schedule these therapies over time still need to be answered. The scheduling aspect becomes even more difficult and complex when several therapeutic agents are involved. For these combination therapies no medical guidelines are in place yet and mathematical modeling and analysis are able to give valuable insights into establishing robust and effective treatment protocols. Mathematical models for combination therapies are quite complex and, due to the various therapies pursued, are described by multi-input control systems. In this project, geometric methods from modern optimal control will be applied and developed as needed to analyze these systems when chemotherapy or radiotherapy are combined with anti-angiogenic treatments. Starting with simplified, but biologically validated models, increasingly more realistic medical features such as the pharmacokinetics of the agents and tumor immune system interactions will be incorporated. For these models unconventional mathematical structures arise that have not been analyzed in the context of biomedical applications before and are worthwhile to be investigated on their own merit. Our analysis employs tools that go well beyond the application of standard necessary conditions for optimality and aims at a full synthesis of optimal controls, i.e., a complete solution to the problem for arbitrary initial data. These solutions will set theoretical benchmarks to which other - simpler and practically realizable - protocols can be compared. The ultimate goal is to design robust and effective realizable protocols for combination therapies. Due to its applied and interdisciplinary character, the project contains a substantial educational component of interest to students from various fields including Mathematics, Biology and Engineering. Existing efforts to attract women and minorities to the project will be continued.

These genes can be used to develop crop plants able to withstand saline conditions. We plan to identify salt tolerance genes by a novel method that takes advantage of insights from evolutionary biology theory. The Galapagos tomato is extremely tolerant to high salt levels as a result of the strong selective pressures brought to bear on this species when it first colonized the Galapagos. We plan to identify the genes that adapted in the Galapagos tomato to confer halotolerance, by comparing the transcriptome of the Galapagos tomato to the modern cultivated tomato. Our approach is to first narrow the search to positively selected genes, that is, genes that have undergone adaptive evolution to suit a particular purpose or need. This will be accomplished by high-throughput sequencing of the transcriptome of the Galapagos tomato, followed by a bioinformatic screening for those genes that bear the distinctive signature of molecular positive selection. We expect to find a set of genes that confer salt tolerance; these can then be used for improvement of crop plant halotolerance.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the ultimate development of crop plants able to withstand saline soil conditions. Some 24 million acres of arable land are abandoned each year due to salinization. Food production could be increased if crop productivities can be maintained in spite of land salinization. In addition to the immeasurable societal impact of extending food supply and increasing potentially available arable land, this project will have a significant commercial value, as improving salt tolerance in crop plants has been estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Finally, this project, if successful, will have an impact on our scientific understanding of salt tolerance mechanisms in plants, and of the adaptive processes that operate in small isolated populations.

Main St, Suite 710	Durham	NC	277054010	9196843030	BIO	1181	9169, EGCH	$0.00	Long-term observations of forest carbon accumulation, beginning at forest inception and continuing through the life of the forest, are exceedingly rare. While aboveground forest biomass is a large and easily-measured pool of carbon, carbon in soils and in dead wood (coarse woody detritus, CWD) ?so called ?slow pools??are little studied. Yet these slow pools store carbon long after trees are removed or die. This research investigates 50 years of carbon accumulation following the planting of tree seedlings in a South Carolina cotton field, and estimates the slowly cycling pools of carbon in soil and CWD in comparison to the carbon in the total forest. This work will estimate and link aboveground and belowground CWD dynamics, a step no other study has taken. While CWD has accumulated in this forest, deep soils appear to have lost carbon since forest inception, counter to assumptions that reforestation should increase or have no effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. <br/><br/>This research will examine effects of reforestation on soil carbon via detailed analyses of changes in SOC chemistry and stability during forest development. Expanded research is necessary to understand whether SOC changes are permanent or transient phenomena, and what the ramifications will be for forest carbon sequestration efforts. Finally, current carbon accounting protocols differ in data requirements and treatment of uncertainty, which results in divergent estimates of creditable carbon storage. This continued research on carbon storage and dynamics in a managed forest, and collaboration with colleagues in the international Long Term Soil Experiment network, US Forest Service, and the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions, will aid development of rigorous carbon offset protocols and improve estimation of carbon stocks and uncertainties by land owners and managers.

The purpose of the William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is to investigate <br/>common themes and techniques among significant areas of current research in geometry and topology and to support junior researchers interested in these areas. This years workshop will bring together leading researchers in geometry and topology who have a special interest in problems related to Knots, Surfaces and Three-Manifolds and will investigate a number of important questions at the forefront of research in these areas. The confluence of expertise from different areas will result in new collaborative projects, and in broadening the research horizons of the participants. <br/><br/><br/>Among the main topics of the workshop will be the virtual Haken conjecture, that every closed hyperbolic 3-manifold has a finite cover that contains a closed incompressible surface. The conjecture has motivated extensive work of many researchers in recent times, and is one of the main problems in the area. A surge of new and exciting ideas, in particular Kahn and Markovic's proof of the surface subgroup conjecture, Wise's work on quasiconvex heirarchies, and Agol's virtual fibering criterion, has provided new avenues to tackle this problem and there is reason to believe that a solution may well be in sight. The workshop will also concentrate on recent advances in low-dimensional topology made by researchers in Heegaard Floer theory. We will discuss open questions in the field including the Berge conjecture which gives a conjectural list of those knots in the three-sphere which admit a Lens-space surgery. Another topic will be the recently announced proof by Guilfoyle and Klingenberg of the Caratheodory conjecture, that any closed convex surface in 3-dimensional Euclidean space must have at least 2 umbilic points. <br/>Through sharing new techniques and insights, it is hoped that progress can be made on a number of these important questions.
1045670	RAPID: Impact of Nutrient Limitation on Microbial Degradation of Deepwater Horizon Oil in the Gulf of Mexico	OCE	CHEMICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	06/15/2010	06/10/2010	Benjamin Van Mooy	MA	Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution	Standard Grant	Donald L.

One important characteristic of the Deepwater Horizon oil release that could limit microbial degradation rates is that the oil is surfacing in waters that are highly depleted in available nutrients; microbes need these nutrients in order to grow and degrade oil. Although there have been comparatively few studies on N and P limitation of oil degradation since the 1980s, in the intervening time there have been major advances in our ability to assess the identity, activity and nutrient-limitation status of microbes in seawater; most of the early work centered on simply tracking the disappearance of oil over time, but now we have the ability to monitor the behavior of the microbial community in parallel.<br/><br/>With funding through this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID), a team of microbial biogeochemists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will examine how microbial heterotrophy, nutrients, and petroleum compounds in the oil spill interact. They posit that the obvious potential for nutrient limitation to impact the degradation of oil from the Deepwater Horizon release warrants an immediate, targeted assessment of this issue in the Gulf of Mexico using up-to-date microbial and molecular methods. The study will achieve three objectives: 1) assess the degree to which microbes in the Gulf of Mexico are stressed by the unavailability of nutrients both inside and outside of areas contaminated by Deepwater Horizon oil; 2) examine the relationship between nutrient stress and the microbial degradation rate of Deepwater Horizon oil; 3) specifically determine whether oil degradation rates are stimulated by lecithin, a plant-derived, non-toxic, hydrophobic N- and P-containing organic nutrient. <br/><br/>Broader impacts The Deepwater Horizon oil release is an event of historic significance that has the potential to severely negatively impact the environmental quality and economic competitiveness of our nation. The primary benefit of the proposed work will be to reveal potential biogeochemical barriers to microbial oil degradation that might be overcome through novel remediation efforts. In addition, by conducting measurements collected by the lead investigator in 2002, the project will have the secondary benefit of identifying perturbations in the phosphorous field that will be propagated throughout the food web, including Gulf of Mexico fisheries.

The approach to achieve ohmic contact is to synthesize conductor-organic semiconducting molecule-conductor with nanoscale metallic or molecularly doped contacts self-assembled or templated by DNAs. The conducting contacts are self-aligned and make contacts with each end of the organic semiconductor molecule (OSM) with length scale ranges from 5-100 nm. Precisely fabricated, ultrasmall gaps are not needed since the overall hybrid structure will be much longer than the organic molecule of interest. Experiments on electrostatic modification of molecular electronic states via a nearby strongly coupled gate electrode are included. The methods developed are expected to lay the groundwork for developing useful molecular electronic devices and eventually integrating them into complex circuits. <br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science and macromolecular chemistry with technological relevance, and is expected to provide unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate training in an interdisciplinary field. The proposed work will allow direct measurement of charge transport through single molecules with different chemical functionalities and length, providing critical information on whether organic molecules have sufficient performance for nanoelectronics. The PI will continue with her activities to reach out to a broad population ranging from K-12, community college, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as efforts to engage and prepare the teachers of tomorrow for new areas of science and technology. This project will expose both graduate students and undergraduates to organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, surface chemistry, materials and thin film characterization, device fabrication, and device characterization. Students will experience an interdisciplinary approach to problem solving and become equipped with a combination of technical engineering skills, basic scientific understanding, and communication skills. This project is co-supported by the DMR Electronic and Photonic Materials and CHE MSN (Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry) programs.

Current approaches to providing wide angle optics for cameras are based on lenses and mirrors that are limited in design by optimization methods based on traditional optics where optical field compression, in addition to residual aberration and mirror conic constants are used in optimization. This results in relatively large optics relative to digital sensor size as well as low resolution at wide angles. In this project, a theoretical framework for aberration correction in wide angle optics considering field compression as a driving constraint will be investigated, with a goal at achieving optics sizes close to the size of the digital sensors that they are designed for. This will be done by introducing field compression constraints in an existing optical design package and modifying the optimization path by introducing approaches for off axis ray aiming. It is anticipated that the Phase I work will result in a modified optics optimization package for designing ultra-wide angle compact optics for digital sensors. A concept optics design demonstrating the features of the package will be demonstrated.<br/><br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in broadening availability of wide angle high resolution systems for a number of defense, homeland security and commercial markets. The development of an optimization tool for compact wide angle optics with high digital resolution at extreme angles of incidence will enable future developments of tools for compact wide angle adaptively variable resolutions, opening up the space of available solutions for wide area imagery. The project seeks to determine the influence of number, shape and arrangement of key optical surfaces on size, quality and resolution, and the impact on cost and scalability. This will have a broader impact on the optical design community as it will provide a framework to develop optical systems that demonstrate optical quality without sacrificing digital resolution. Applications such as persistent wide area surveillance, vehicle 360- degree situational awareness, wide angle video conferencing and webcams will benefit from this research. The availability of ultra-wide angle high resolution camera systems has the potential to better exploit the growth path of ever smaller high resolution digital image sensors with new potential consumer applications such as cameras on televisions and inexpensive wide angle cameras for surveillance.

The dynamics of each individual node, such as a neuron, are highly nonlinear, the underlying network topology is anything but homogeneous, and the most relevant network phenomena exhibit structural features over a multitude of spatiotemporal scales. To advance the understanding of pulsed-coupled networks arising from the study of complex information-processing systems, it is critical to develop a general conceptual framework capable of formulating coarse-grained, statistical descriptions of large-scale pulse-coupled network dynamics over complex network topologies. Current mathematical tools, such as techniques from statistical mechanics, cannot be readily applied to these pulsed-coupled systems, since most of the assumptions upon which these techniques are based (e.g., stationarity, homogeneity of the interaction network, etc.) simply do not hold. The aim of the proposed research is to take a first step towards tackling these conceptual issues via: (i) The systematic extension of kinetic theory formulations of uncorrelated homogeneous pulsed-coupled network dynamics to incorporate pairwise correlations between pulse-coupled nodes within the network, as well as fluctuations in network activity that arise as a consequence of network topology (ii) The search for an appropriate definition of entropy for pulse-coupled network systems that will serve as a unifying principle to both (a) extend the maximum entropy principle that has been successful in simplifying the dynamics associated with certain idealized pulsed-coupled network systems, and (b) characterize the nature of global fluctuations of network dynamics over realistic network topology.<br/><br/>A development of a theoretical framework of organizing principles that can capture statistical behaviors of network dynamics over complex topologies is potentially transformative in understanding of general information transmission and processing over general network topologies. A successful implementation of theoretical methodologies proposed here will have strong impact on how we model large-scale, pulse-coupled network dynamics, in particular, neuronal network dynamics, and on how we theoretically investigate brain dynamics from a new coarse-grained perspective. This would be a first step towards undertaking the scientific challenge of addressing how structural connectivity underlies functional and effective connectivity in the brain. It is important to emphasize that the general theoretical issues addressed in this proposal will have ramifications in assisting the analysis and understanding of many other dynamics on complicated networks, such as chemical reaction cascades, genetic networks, traffic networks etc, in particular to systems neuroscience. The proposed work will provide postdocs and graduate students with exciting research projects in applied mathematics as well as in theoretical problems arising from systems neuroscience.

This project will perform theoretical studies of new approaches to the generation of femtosecond light pulses and optical bullets in mode-locked lasers. The underlying mathematical methods are rooted in nonlinear dispersive wave theory and their dynamics and stability in nonlinear, saturable media. New pulse-shaping mechanisms have the potential for major impact on ultrafast science, but current theoretical understanding is rudimentary because a pulse undergoes large changes in its temporal shape, spectral shape, and phase or frequency as it traverses a laser cavity; these in turn pose severe challenges to mathematical models. Highly-chirped and/or self-similar pulse solutions can exist in the presence of strong dissipation, creating new classes of laser pulses that offer remarkable behavior and performance. Development of improved models proposed here will enable major scientific advances such as the generation of multidimensional solitons and will lead to enhanced instruments for applications. The research aims to be of a truly interdisciplinary nature: combining asymptotic and perturbation methods, scientific computation, and rigorous mathematical analysis with models which are based on experimental observations. <br/><br/>The impact of the proposed research will extend beyond the understanding of nonlinear pulse propagation in laser systems. The concepts developed in this project will bear on a range of topics, from the fundamental science of nonlinear dynamical systems to commercial laser instruments. Lasers that generate femtosecond-duration optical pulses have great potential for expanding the range of short-pulse optical techniques into real-world applications such as precision micro-machining, nonlinear optical imaging techniques, including multi-photon and Raman microscopies, and ocular surgery. It is very likely that performance advances that result from this work will be implemented in research and commercial laboratories, and there is strong potential for commercial development. The students working on this project will gain experience ranging from analytical solutions of partial differential equations to numerical simulations, understanding of ultrafast nonlinear optics, and exposure to technical aspects of photonics. The close collaboration of professional theorists with physicists, engineers, and industrial scientists will significantly broaden and enhance the students' educational experiences and prepare them for a range of future opportunities in the mathematical sciences.

This project will support a series of three collaborative workshops that will examine the roles of natural history in research and education, develop mechanisms to increase the availability of natural history information, and improve the interfaces of natural history with research, education, and applied science. <br/><br/> This project will result in an assessment of information gaps and priority research areas; suggested procedures to improve communication of natural history among the educational, business, agency, and non-profit practitioners and users of natural history; and a network to expand natural history information and its use. Each workshop includes provision for greater impacts of the activities, including participation by students and post-doctoral scientists, post-conference assessment of impact of the workshop on the institutions of participants, production of podcasts to be made available through the internet, and panel discussions for the general public. The workshops will produce a broad post-workshop initiative to improve the interfaces of natural history with education, research, and environmental problem-solving.
1001729	Classifying spaces of degenerating Hodge structures, the p-adic analogue, and related arithmetic study	DMS	ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM	07/01/2010	05/02/2012	Kazuya Kato	IL	University of Chicago	Continuing grant	Tie Luo	06/30/2014	$427,128.00	Spencer Bloch, Takako Fukaya	kkato@math.uchicago.edu	5801 South Ellis Avenue	Chicago	IL	606375418	7737028669	MPS	1264		$0.00	In this proposal, the principal investigator K. Kato intends to study degenerations of Hodge structures and related problems, collaborating with the co-principal investigators S. Bloch and T. Fukaya. K. Kato and S. Usui constructed toroidal partial compactifications of classifying spaces of polarized Hodge structures in which points at infinity correspond to degenerations of Hodge structures. He is now generalizing this theory to treat mixed Hodge structures and also p-adic Hodge structures. With S. Bloch, he plans to study asymptotic behaviors of period integrals and regulators in degeneration, by using the study of degenerations of Hodge structures. Period integrals and regulators are related to values of zeta functions. The PI's intend to study related problems concerning arithmetic properties of zeta values. It is expected that the study of this proposal on degenerations of Hodge structures have various applications. For example, Hodge conjecture is related to degeneration of intermediate Jacobian which is understood as a class group of degenerating Hodge structures, and so, it is expected that the study of this proposal can contribute to the solution of Hodge conjecture. S. Bloch studied the relation of the theory of motives and the period integrals which appear in physics. The divergence of such period integral is an important subject in physics, and it is expected that the divergence is well understood by the degeneration of motives and degeneration of associated Hodge structures. The study of this proposal is expected to have applications to physics.<br/><br/>Understanding of degeneration for geometric objects (spaces or mathematical structures) is an important but difficult problem. By constructing enlarged classifying spaces of mathematical structures in which points on the boundary correspond to degenerations, the PI's can better understand degeneration. For example, in physics it is important to understand various infinite limits. In this program, the divergences in physics are understood as arising from degeneration of mathematical structures, and it is expected that this study will clarify such asymptotic behavior. Values of zeta functions often appear in physics, and K. Kato, S. Bloch and T. Fukaya have studied arithmetic properties of zeta values. They intend to study the relations between degenerations and zeta values. One may hope that in this way the deep relation between nature and arithmetic can be better understood. More generally, many unsolved problems in mathematics are related to degeneration, and it is expected that the study of this proposal will contribute to the solution of them.

These advertisements began in 2007, and are considered representations of scientific and technological innovation. The project aims at understanding how differently positioned women (and men) relate to these advertisements and to the new pharmaceutical technology they represent. This ethnographic work provides a textured articulation of not what women in India think as a monolithic group, but rather how a wide range of experiences and subjectivities contribute to various contemporary understandings of techno-scientific information. It contributes to science and technology studies scholarship on the public understanding of science and global pharmaceutical practices. <br/><br/>The research is animated by an awareness that women may occupy multiple roles (they may be doctors, pharmacists or consumers, for example) and that direct-to-consumer advertisements may, in complex ways, be simultaneously empowering, confusing, informative, and deceptive. Through focus groups, interviews, and participant observation with women, physicians, and pharmacists this research explores the socio-cultural implications of mediated biomedical knowledge. Additionally, the project is designed to historically locate these advertisements within a larger nation-building project and address not only how these advertisements appease local publics' desires (both for commodities and as social manifestations of modernity) but also how they ameliorate physicians' and global audiences' anxieties about an over-populated nation.
1036477	International: US-Germany Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement: High-resolution Laser Ablation ICP-MS Analysis of Metamorphic Rocks from California, Germany, and the Czech Republic	OISE	PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY, IRES	07/01/2010	06/24/2010	Maureen Feineman	PA	Pennsylvania State Univ University Park	Standard Grant	Maija M Kukla	06/30/2012	$14,910.00		mdf12@psu.edu	110 Technology Center Building	UNIVERSITY PARK	PA	168027000	8148651372	O/D	1573, 7727	5936, 5979	$0.00	Subduction zones are one of the primary manifestations of plate tectonics, occuring where two of Earth's plates collide and one slips beneath the other. Subduction of one plate beneath another functions as the primary mechanism for mass transfer between the surface and interior of the Earth. An understanding of fluid-driven chemical cycling in subduction zones provides us with the tools to discover valuable natural resources such as metal ores and natural gas and oil reserves, to develop new resources such as geothermal energy, and to understand the geologic hazards of subduction zones such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. This study focuses on the distribution of trace elements in fluids produced in the down-going plate during subduction zone metamorphism. These fluids are responsible for generating the magmas that produce arc volcanoes. In particular, high-pressure metamorphic rocks such as eclogite (subducted oceanic crust) are valuable resources for studying fluid production and transfer within the deeper parts of the subduction zone. In order to track the mobility of trace elements in subduction fluids, this study will examine the geochemistry of individual minerals found in eclogite from the Ring Mountain locality of the Franciscan Complex in California, and the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) region of Germany and the Czech Republic. In particular, garnet and rutile will be analyzed in detail to examine the behavior of rare earth and high field strength elements during the production and transport of fluids in eclogitic rocks.<br/><br/>The preferred method for analyzing a broad spectrum of trace elements in individual mineral grains is laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Complementary LA-ICP-MS facilities exist at Pennsylvania State University in the US and the University of Mainz in Germany. Faculty at Mainz have developed cutting edge methods that make use of information encoded in minor mineral phases in metamorphic rocks, such as Zr-in-rutile thermometry and U-Pb geochronology. Together these methods can be used to develop a temperature-time history for our samples to help us interpret the conditions under which fluid transport occurred. Penn State PhD student Alicia Cruz-Uribe will spend six weeks at the LA-ICP-MS laboratory in Mainz learning how to implement these specialized analytical techniques from her host and mentor, Dr. Thomas Zack. Cruz-Uribe will return to the US with her knowledge of these techniques to be implemented at the LA-ICP-MS facility at Penn State, under the guidance of advisor Dr. Maureen Feineman. The student will benefit both by direct exposure to new methods and new ways of thinking as well as by teaching those methods to other students upon her return. Both institutes benefit by virtue of the collaborative international research project. This project is funded jointly by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Earth Sciences.

The PI involves the intelligent standardization of shipments and coordination of resources to facilitate system-wide efficiency in a networked economy much in the way that the digital Internet is based on transmitting standards packets of information. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the transformative paradigm associated with PI, in general, and the optimization and simulation models formulated to establish the logistics system gain potential, in particular. These model formulations will be a contribution to the field as mathematically rigorous models, resulting in publications that will appear in leading archival journals. The studies utilizing the models will be disseminated in applications-based journals. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the PI2 include the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of logistics transactions through intelligent standardization in a consumer sector that demands the efficient delivery of product over a worldwide supply chain. Such standardization will then unleash economic development capable of growing industries while reducing energy consumption and waste for the nation, as well as providing additional capacity to our nation's logistics system. Participation by students, including continued recruitment of students from underrepresented groups, will be emphasized and they will benefit from this collaborative research project with industry.

Organic semiconductors are being considered as alternative materials to conventional silicon-based electronics, possibly enabling a new generation of low-cost, mechanically flexible, easily manufactured electronic devices. Asynchronous logic, which does not rely on timing assumption, may be the best design method for such technologies where the parameters are not well controlled and the implementation of a global clock-network is very difficult. The argument is that, since all parameter variations affect the timing, a logic that is independent of the timing and that does not use a clock, will tolerate extreme parameter variations. The main goal of this research is to apply asynchronous logic to the design of digital systems in printed electronics. The hope is that, by relaxing the requirements on the physical parameters imposed by timing constraints, the currrent state of the technology may become ``good enough'' for implementing digital circuits without further improvement. A concrete target is to design and fabricate the very first microcontroller in printed electronics, more specifically with inkjet printer technology.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Organic semiconductors will not replace current silicon-based technology as the performance characteristics are very different. But other properties of the devices---low cost, light weight, flexibility, and short fabrication time---open the door to new exciting applications. Obvious ones come to mind: active RFID and smart labels, wearable electronics with health-care and defense applications, biometric and chemical sensors with added intelligence, large-area sensors, active matrix backplane for displays, mobile communications, energy. But probably the most interesting ones are still to be discovered. The idea of being able to print circuits on an inkjet printer with one single type of polymer and in ambient conditions is very appealing because of the potential simplicity and availability of the technique. Comparing the price of a current IC fabrication facility (billions of dollars) to the price of an inkjet printer (thousands of dollars) is enough to appreciate the huge potentials of the technology. An added advantage in an academic environment is that the idea of printing their own circuits would be very exciting to students...

These facets arise from practical constraints imposed on auctions: Budget constraints on the bidders, and asymmetric and incomplete information between the bidder and auctioneer. The PI seeks to develop and employ techniques from theoretical computer science, particularly approximation algorithms, adversarial mechanism design, stochastic control, and learning theory to develop novel tools and techniques to address these questions. The intellectual merit of the proposed research will be in blending, encompassing, and extending work on related problems in theoretical computer science, economics, stochastic decision theory, and computational learning, thereby developing new theoretical models and solutions, which in turn will impact the respective disciplines. Furthermore, it is imperative to develop such tools since the facets we consider will become critical to the successful deployment of auctions in several modern internet-based settings. The proposed work will also be broadly disseminated via workshops and specialized courses.

The project seeks to understand how these behavioral decisions affect the genetics of populations. Single nucleotide differences in DNA sequences between two species of neotropical stream fish will be used to study the genetics of hybrid populations in an area of Mexico where the two species hybridize in the wild. Since hybrid fish are sometimes difficult to visually distinguish from parent species, this molecular approach will enable investigators to identify fish as hybrid or parent species. Knowing the species identity of individuals will allow the investigators to examine behavioral decisions by determining who females mate with (mate choice decisions) and who individuals spend time with (social decisions), as well as whether there are differences in post-birth survival among hybrids and pure parentals in these livebearing fish. Preliminary results suggest that behavioral decisions may be more important in shaping the genetics of populations than is selection against hybrid fish. Further molecular work will allow more in-depth analyses of behavior and genetic patterns. This work will build and expand upon understanding the contributions of both pre-mating behavior (social decisions and mate choice decisions) and post-mating behavior (differential fertilization of eggs and natural selection) to the fate of natural hybrids, reproductive isolation of species and speciation. The project and investigators will accomplish outreach through the CICHAZ field station in Mexico via electronic media and mentoring of a Mexican student in molecular techniques in addition to continuing to foster internationally collaborative projects.

The project is interdisciplinary and collaborative among investigators at U-Michigan, U-Notre Dame, U-College Cork, and the Tyndall Institute (Ireland). A primary objective is to identify and understand synthesis/processing mechanisms along with conditions needed to manipulate the microstructure and consequent electronic states and optical emission efficiencies of these materials. Dilute nitride-bismide alloy films will be synthesized using plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy, using both amphoteric (group IV) and alternative (group VI) dopants. The microstructure will be tailored using a novel approach to seed compositional patterns using pre-growth focused-ion-beam implantation. The atomic-to-nanometer-scale structure will be determined using state-of-the-art microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. These results will be interpreted using a complementary set of computational studies, including density functional theory, tight-binding calculations, and effective-mass based calculations.<br/><br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. The scientific insights from this project are expected to enable the development of temperature-insensitive light-emitters, high efficiency photovoltaics, and high performance transistors to be used in the telecommunications, radar, and automotive industries. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will benefit from working together in an interdisciplinary scientific learning environment across disciplines of chemistry, physics, and engineering. The established collaboration constitutes an advantageous approach, benefitting from the complementary expertise of investigators covering theory and experiment. The new knowledge created will be broadly disseminated through publications and presentations. Outreach activities will emphasize the mentoring of women and underrepresented minorities.

Due to the emergence of novel materials with multifunctionalities, and the significant progress made in recent years on new memory technologies, ISIF coverage has now been expanded to include the science and technology of many multifunctional materials, thus providing a new vision of the field of integrated functionalities. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/><br/>Most of the distinguished invited (over 120) and plenary (5) speakers, have already confirmed their participation, ensuring representation from the Americas, Europe, and Asia. This proposal will enable the ISIF organizers to support attendance by at least 10 graduate students for the full length of the symposium. The students will be able to attend all conferences, present their research in poster sessions, visit the technical exhibit, and interact with all other participants. In addition several tutorials by specialists will be offered free-of-charge. The unique educational opportunities offered by this symposium will enhance the preparation of participating students, and their participation will also in turn enrich ISIF by fostering interest by the next generation of scientists and engineers who will advance the crucial research areas which are central to the emerging field of multifunctional materials and technology.

Cook at North Dakota State University to develop new synthetic methods for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines and alcohols. In particular the project will investigate novel enantioselective allylation reactions of carbon-nitrogen and carbon-oxygen double bonds mediated by the environmentally friendly metals indium and bismuth. Enantioselective catalytic allylation is a highly desired route for the preparation of chiral building blocks that can be utilized in the preparation of biologically active small molecule pharmaceuticals and tools for biological sciences. This project will develop highly catalytic enantioselective allylation of ketimines mediated by indium. Additionally, allylation of ketones mediated by bismuth metal in the presence of chiral bismuth catalysts will be developed. The purported asymmetric catalysts for both of these processes will be isolated and characterized to provide insight for future directions for the generation of environmentally benign asymmetric methods.<br/><br/> Selective chemical reactions that can be accomplished with minimal waste using non-toxic catalysts and reagents will allow for new greener chemical processes for future environmentally sustainable technologies. This project will provide research experiences for undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the chemical sciences. In particular, undergraduate students early in their college careers (freshmen and sophomores) will benefit from this research experience. Statistics show that students engaged earlier in their college experience have a higher probability of continuing on to a career in science. This project will directly aid the goals of NSF and the Country to increase human resources in sciences.

The first project seeks characterizations of Hodge-theoretic invariants of complex algebraic varieties, with an emphasis on computational aspects. Potential applications include a new explicit solution to the lattice point counting problem, and a Novikov-type conjecture in algebraic geometry. In the second project, the PI proposes a detailed study of certain global analytic invariants of complex hypersurfaces which measure the complexity of singularities. A connection with the Donaldson-Thomas theory of certain Calabi-Yau trifolds is also suggested. In the third project, the PI aims to develop equivariant characteristic class theories for singular complex algebraic varieties, with primary applications to the computation of characteristic classes of orbifolds. In particular, the results sought in this part of the proposal can be used to compute generating series for characteristic classes of symmetric products of singular varieties, generalizing and unifying many of the existing results in the literature. In a different but related vein, the PI plans to develop suitable characteristic class theories for complex varieties which are defined over the field of real numbers; such invariants encode deep topological and analytical obstructions on the set of real points of a complex variety, i.e., on the existence of real solutions of a system of polynomial equations with real coefficients.<br/><br/>Topology is the branch of mathematics that studies patterns of geometric figures involving position and relative position without regard to size. From the very beginning, topology has evolved under the influence of questions arising from the attempt to understand properties of singular (or irregular) spaces. Such spaces occur naturally in various fields of pure mathematics including geometric topology, algebraic geometry, number theory, and also in more applied fields, such as the study of configuration spaces for robot motion planning. Algebraic varieties, i.e., the spaces of solutions of polynomial equations, are major examples of singular spaces. They are the main objects of study in algebraic geometry, and also provide a convenient testing ground for topological theories. The proposed research aims to improve our understanding of topological properties of algebraic varieties, a task which often involves the discovery and study of subtle interactions between the local and global behavior of various invariants.

Theoretical and computational approaches are used in the awarded project for inquiring what vibrational spectroscopic techniques can reveal about the properties of liquids and solutions confined in nanoscale silica pores of varying size (~2.4 to 4.5 nm in diameter) and surface functionality (hydroxyl- and alkyl-terminated). Dramatic changes in the molecular-level liquid structure and dynamics occur upon such nanoscale confinement, yet these effects are not readily observable in the linear infrared (IR) spectra. By analyzing vibrational spectroscopic probes, this project sheds light on the complex structure and dynamics of nanoconfined liquids. The project focuses on confined acetonitrile and related systems. The application choice is based on the presence of a dramatic blue shift in the CN stretching frequency upon hydrogen bonding and the relatively slow vibration relaxation, which permits examination of longer timescale dynamics. A combination of molecular dynamics, grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, electronic structure calculations, and mixed quantum-classical MD are the chosen methodologies. The proposed properties to be studied include: i) determination of the relative intensities of hydrogen bonded and non-hydrogen bonded peaks in the linear infrared spectra of nitriles and isonitriles, ii) prediction of the IR pump-probe spectroscopy of CH3CN confined in silica pores of varying surface chemistry, iii) prediction of the IR photon echo spectroscopy of CH3CN confined in silica pores of varying surface chemistry, and iv) simulation of the spectroscopy of solutes in nanoconfined CH3CN and of a CH3CN solute in other nanoconfined liquids.<br/><br/>Porous silica materials are of interest in catalysis, separations, and sensing and are part of a wider class of porous oxide materials similarly important in a variety of applications. Moreover, nanoconfined liquids are present in a number of other systems including supramolecular assemblies, templated materials, reverse micelles, biological systems, hydrogels, membranes, fuel cell electrodes, and nonlinear optical materials. The broader impact aim of this project is to gain deeper mechanistic understanding of how liquids move and interact within nanoconfined structures and how these mechanisms can be probed via spectroscopy to assist in the design and characterization of applications that exploit the unique physical properties of liquids in confined environments. Graduate and undergraduate students are involved in this research, providing them with training in theoretical and computational techniques and a broad background in physical chemistry. The participation of underrepresented groups continues to be encouraged within this research group.

1008426	Mathematical Analysis of Complex Fluids	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	07/01/2010	06/22/2010	Michael Renardy	VA	Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University	Standard Grant	Henry A.

The project will resolve a number of open questions. The development of a rigorous foundation for analyzing the stability of viscoelastic flows has long presented an unresolved challenge. Unlike the case of Newtonian flows, there are no applicable theorems of a general nature that link stability to spectral properties or allow deducing nonlinear stability from linearized stability. The project will build on recent developments concerning advective systems that promise the possibility of a rigorous study of the stability of creeping flows of viscoelastic fluids. Another part of the project involves formulation and analysis of models for complex yield stress behavior. Phenomena such as yield stress hysteresis, time dependence of yield stress and thixotropy will be explained by a combination of fast and slow dynamics which arises in a singular limit of certain models of viscoelastic flows. The infinite Weissenberg number limit provides another class of problems rife with unresolved mathematical and numerical issues. Work under the project will address the well-posedness of equations which describe the infinite Weissenberg number limit, and singular perturbation problems associated with this limit. The PI will also continue his research on the controllability of viscoelastic flows. Such flows are not fully controllable.<br/>The stress tensor in a viscoelastic fluid is subject to certain positive definiteness restrictions which, physically, result from the fact that polymer molecules can be stretched by a flow, but cannot be forced to retract. A precise quantification of this positivity requirement, however, is in general quite difficult.<br/><br/>Complex fluids, such as polymers, pastes, and emulsions, arise in numerous applications in the plastics and food industries, as well as biological systems. The equations modeling such fluids are only partly understood. The project will address several important issues arising in the study of these equations, leading to a better understanding of phenomena as well as better methods of their numerical simulation. Flow instabilities, yield behavior of some fluids (which start to flow only when loaded above a certain threshold), problems of the highly elastic limit, and control of flow are among the problems addressed in this work. Several graduate students are already participating in this research.

This project will optimize materials for dual NOx and NH3 sensing through experimentation and testing, establish mechanistic models for both NOx and NH3 sensing, and validate the mechanistic model. Currently commercially available NOx sensors fail to meet the accuracy, response time, and price requirements of these complex after-treatment systems. Ammonia or dual NOx /NH3 sensors are not available commercially. The small business has recently identified an electrocatalytic NOx sensor technology and has demonstrated the potential for significantly improved accuracy, sensitivity, and response time over the commercial technology. Through modification to the sensing electrode materials and sensor operating conditions, this sensor technology has also been demonstrated to be sensitive to ammonia. In this project, the NOx sensing mechanisms will be studied to develop this promising technology into an optimized, robust device. Additionally, the ammonia sensitivity will be investigated to establish a dual NOx /NH3 sensor for the diesel emissions after-treatment market.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the enhanced ability to monitor NOx, which is a major global pollutant and a precursor to acid rain, and ground-level ozone and smog formation. New environmental regulations are driving NOx emissions to increasingly lower levels, with the most challenging of these being the 2010 EPA Tier 2 diesel tailpipe standards. To meet these, engine manufacturers have been developing new diesel after-treatment technologies including selective catalyst reduction (SCR) systems and lean NOx traps and require both NOx and ammonia sensors for closed loop control and diagnostics of these systems. If successful, the new NOx sensor has the potential to significantly reduce emissions levels of these gases through more accurate and faster detection than the competition. Moreover, the additional NH3 sensitivity offers a solution for monitoring of ammonia slip, an issue for which no commercial sensor currently exists. With a >$1.2 billion market forecasted for 2012, the NOx /NH3 sensor has tremendous commercial potential. Additionally, the new sensor technology is expected to be a lower cost approach, enabling the diesel industry to have a sensor that meets both the technical and price requirements.

GARRETTSVILLE	OH	442319749	3304684984	ENG	5371	1179, 5371, 9188, EGCH	$0.00	This SBIR Phase I project will show proof-of-concept for a structured bed reactor using dry materials coating metal foil surfaces to capture CO2 from power plants and other combustion sources. This process will employ a scale-up version of an existing heat exchanging reactor platform in combination with sorbent materials developed by Hoffman at the National Energy Technology Laboratory and other new materials, that can lower the regenerative heat by 30-40% compared to the use of CO2 capture with aqueous methanolamine currently in use. The system could remove 90% of the CO2 while keeping the increase in cost of electricity under the 35% threshold.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to have effective mechanisms to remove CO2 at low costs. When commercialized, the technology will reduce green house gas emissions and reduce imports of energy from foreign sources. This is expected to be done below the U.S. Department of Energy aggressive targets of $20 per ton of CO2 removal and 35% increase in<br/>cost of electricity. Further, this technology will impose very low parasitic backpressure on power plant exhaust. The transformational nature of the technology, coupled with the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, will ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies. The technology could also be applied to other sources of CO2 and it could be eventually be exported to countries like China and India.
1013989	SBIR Phase I: High-Temperature, Low-Noise Nanotransistors	IIP	SMALL BUSINESS PHASE I	07/01/2010	01/13/2011	Dean Tsang	MA	Xeresearch Corporation	Standard Grant	Grace Jinliu Wang	06/30/2011	$149,746.00		dean.tsang@verizon.net	26 Beacon Street #34F	Burlington	MA	018033811	7812731423	ENG	5371	1517, 1769, 5371, 9163, AMPP	$0.00	This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of nanolayer transistors composed of a new channel material for high temperature and low noise applications. The new nanolayer transistors are expected to have significantly better performance in an operating temperature range of 300 to 400 degrees C, as well as low noise and high gain relative to currently available transistors. Currently, electronics cannot operate at 300 degree C or higher, temperatures encountered in oil drilling, aerospace, automotive, and other hot noisy environments. This project will use standard semiconductor processing equipment to fabricate a device structure that consists of nanolayers of material grown controllably by atomic layer deposition. Device feasibility will be shown through current modulation with applied gate voltage. Attempts will also be made to investigate transistor I-V characteristics and their temperature dependence on probed devices. A successful device demonstration may be an impetus to additional studies on the effects of an electric field in these ultrathin materials, including better theoretical treatments, materials characterization, novel materials, and impurity trap measurements.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project, if successful, can be large to the economy and society. Availability of high temperature and lower noise electronics can lead to better monitoring and control of environments like oil drilling, jet and automobile engines, and high temperature industrial processes. Devices with better noise performance can reduce cell phone dropouts and extend cell range. The market for electronics for currently unserved sensor opportunities can grow to $100M as volume applications are addressed.

Szekely	12/31/2015	$320,000.00		brill@stat.berkeley.edu	Sponsored Projects Office	BERKELEY	CA	947045940	5106428109	MPS	1269		$0.00	Consider a moving object whose locations are known at known times. This is the data/process to be studied in the project. It will be called trajectory data. Inherent variability will be assumed making the phenomenon random. The basic process will be assumed to satisfy a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) or a Functional Stochastic Differential Equation (FSDE). In the former case it will be convenient to assume that the object moves in a potential field whose gradient gives the drift term of the SDE. When data are available an approximate likelihood function will be set down for the data. This allows inference procedures such as estimation, simulation and testing to be invoked. The models may be parametric or nonparametric. One or several objects, or particles, may be involved. In the latter case there may be interactions. In the case that explanatory variables are present both fit and predictability may be improved by their inclusion. Practical and theoretical properties of the approach will be developed.<br/><br/> Trajectory data appear in many places these days, particularly since the Global Positioning System (GPS) appeared. Locations of individuals of a collection or of just one object are estimated at a succession of times. The times may be equally spaced or not. They may be different for different objects. One object of this work is to develop mathematical and statistical models for the tracks of the objects. These models may be used to examine scientific hypotheses concerning movements as well as to discover novelties. There may be explanatory variables, such as bathymetry, to include in the modeling. The future movement may depend only on the most recent position or it may depend on more past values. The models need to reflect this and allow examination of the assumption. Data from fields including animal biology, marine biology, astronomy, biophysics will be studied as will the implications of unequally spaced data.

Toward this end the CCMP is convening the Chesapeake Modeling Symposium 2010 as a venue to identify and showcase existing modeling efforts as well as communicate how models are used as decision support tools by different developer and user groups. ChesMS'10 is the second symposium convened by CCMP. ChesMS'08 focused on highlighting and communicating new and innovative Chesapeake ecosystem open source models and building the existing library of available models and tools. ChesMS'10 expands on this by continuing to showcase new modeling efforts while also demonstrating how new and existing models can be applied to aid in Management, Research, and Restoration decision support. By bringing together the model developer and user communities at the symposium, they hope to foster greater intra group understanding and communication. This will lead to more product-focused model development and a more intelligent use of these models. Funding is sought to support travel costs for two invited plenary speakers and funds to defray a portion of registration costs for students. The plenary speakers are established leaders in model development and access while the student stipends ensure affordable access and networking for new modelers, critical for continued student exposure and maturation, model development, and more importantly, application throughout the basin.

Englander	PA	University of Pennsylvania	Continuing grant	Kamal Shukla	06/30/2014	$829,925.00		engl@mail.med.upenn.edu	Research Services	Philadelphia	PA	191046205	2158987293	BIO	1144, 6883	1164, 7465, 9183	$0.00	Although hydrogen exchange (HX) has become the most powerful and fastest growing method for the study of molecular biophysics, the foundational knowledge on which the entire HX enterprise is based is still unfortunately insecure, which seriously hinders the interpretation of HX results. To secure those foundations, this project will pursue a wide ranging effort, integrating experimental and theoretical analysis, to examine the role of alternative HX mechanisms and the protein factors that determine HX behavior. Potential HX mechanisms include unhindered surface HX, solvent penetration, local fluctuations, cooperative subglobal and global unfolding. Potential protein factors include H-bonding, steric blocking, depth of burial, secondary structural type, electrostatic field, interaction density. The objective of this project is to obtain extensive site-resolved HX measurements under various test conditions by NMR techniques best suited for the intended HX time scale (Cleanex-PM for fast HX, standard HSQC for slower HX) and protein size (newly developed fast 3D NMR for larger proteins). In parallel, theoretical analyses will be used to study surface sterics, dynamics, and local fluctuational processes (MD and energy refinement), unfolding reactions (COREX), and electrostatic effects (DelPhi). Four proteins will be used for this study based on their special advantages (size, stability, high resolution structure, charge density, deep burial, known NMR time scale dynamics, preexisting HX information). In addition the large body of published HX data on other proteins provides a valuable reference data base. Examination of the important mechanisms and determining protein factors for many individual hydrogens will solidify HX knowledge and understanding, and will build toward a predictive capability.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The elaboration of HX mechanisms will provide a firm foundation for correctly interpreting the very many ongoing research studies that now use HX approaches as a major tool. Progress made will be communicated through publications in the research literature and in presentations at scientific meetings. Detailed data and results will be published on the laboratory web site for further analysis by the protein community. The scientific work planned in this project will continue to provide an excellent training experience for young scientists. In past years this laboratory has trained a large number of scientists who now hold positions at academic, governmental, and industrial centers. In this year four graduate students from across the University of Pennsylvania campus are training in this lab to enter research careers and this lab serves as a center for a number of others who share lab facilities and intellectual interactions. In past years three graduate students from this lab have been recognized for the Best PhD Dissertation of the Year at the University of Pennsylvania. In addition this lab has always supported a complement of high school and undergraduate college students and involved them in front line research. During the past year five high school students have participated in laboratory research projects. More broadly the current research of this laboratory informs the graduate level lecture/discussion course of the PI which this past year was ranked highest by student evaluation among 32 courses in the Biomedical Graduate Studies program at the U Penn School of Medicine. The PI chairs the Admissions Committee of the Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics graduate program and has overseen an increasing entry of under represented minority students, including 9 URM applicants in the past two years. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Bioscience and the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry division.

The work involves the time series collection of samples to examine the changes, from baseline conditions to maximum exposure, to the oil leaking out of the deepwater well head to a variety of coastal sites along the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Sampling sites include the intertidal zone at Belle Fontaine Point in eastern Mississippi and the New Harbor Islands in Louisiana. Samples and analytical work will determine hydrocarbon transformations and changes due to biogeochemical processes, changes in bioturbation rates, and changes in the assemblages of benthic macro- and meiofauna over time. Implications of these variables for physical and sedimentary processes and for macrofauna will be assessed. Broader impacts of the work will have immediate implications for understanding the impacts of the oil spill on coastal ecosystems and provide data to examine the time scale of ecosystem crash and recovery. The work will have potential for mitigating the long term effects of the oil spill on coastal systems. The work will also train students and provide public outreach activities that will be carried out in collaboration with the Northern Gulf Institution and with NOAA.

Washington	DC	200640001	2026355000	MPS	1232	9251	$0.00	This project covers a research program of fundamental importance for our understanding of the structure of matter and the origin of mass. The focus is on experimental investigations of hadron structure through exclusive production and detection of a single meson or photon. Such processes allow us to gain both a quantitative description and a visualization (tomographic image) of the behavior of strongly interacting systems. This is achieved through the language of Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), which can be measured in a regime where the hard scattering of the probe on a single quark can be factorized from the residual soft interaction that carries the information about the GPDs. Thus, tests of factorization in the kinematics of Jefferson Lab, both today and after the 12 GeV energy upgrade, are essential for the interpretation of GPD data, and in turn for our understanding of nucleon structure.<br/><br/>The participation of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students is an integral part of the project, providing young scientists with opportunities to further their training and education. These will include learning nuclear physics concepts, getting hands-on experience in development of hardware and software, as well as participating in and contributing to cutting edge experiments at a major national laboratory, providing exposure to a broad international scientific community. The PI has considerable experience working with minority students, and by providing a female role model, she could encourage women to pursue advanced studies in physics.
1007790	Geometrical algorithms for the inverse scattering of waves	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	07/01/2010	09/20/2011	Laurent Demanet	MA	Massachusetts Institute of Technology	Continuing grant	James Curry	06/30/2013	$221,497.00		laurent@math.mit.edu	77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE	Cambridge	MA	021394301	6172531000	MPS	1266		$0.00	The proposed research program is an interdisciplinary effort, aimed at implementing mathematically-informed computational solutions to inverse problems that involve volume scattering of elastic and electromagnetic waves in complex media. Seismology, for instance, is in great demand of new algorithms. The current preferred numerical methods--finite difference schemes that make no reference to the underlying geometry of waves--have a serious scalability issue, and give no hint on how to resolve the hard nonlinearity of the inverse problem. We argue that insights from microlocal and harmonic analysis suggest shifting much of the computational burden to a pre-processing predictive of wave kinematics: 1) by passing to a numerical representation in phase space for the operators related to the wave and Helmholtz equations, algorithms for the forward problem can be developed to restore near-linear complexity in the wave field data; and 2) fitting diffeomorphisms directly in phase-space by optimal transport ideas is predicted to resolve some of the nonconvexity issues otherwise arising when the inverse problem is solved using successive linearizations.<br/><br/>Moore's law of exponential increase in computing performance is not often matched by exponential progress in the computational sciences. The culprit is the lack of scalability of mainstream algorithms: the size of problems that can be solved grows more slowly than hardware capabilities. In increasingly many applications, the input of mathematicians is needed to help engineers and applied scientists rethink the design of numerical codes to avoid this curse of scalability. This proposal is an effort to take a step back and introduce new algorithmic ideas for seismic imaging, the discipline concerned with imaging the subsurface of the Earth. Seismic imaging is the energy sector's main predictive tool for hydrocarbon, water, and geothermal energy prospection. It is at the heart of monitoring techniques for reservoirs and carbon sequestration experiments. It has proved useful to geophysicists who debate the geological composition of the Earth's mantle. High-resolution seismic imaging is also starting to enable the Army and the Air Force to detect IEDs. All these remote imaging problems have by now become formidably complex computational questions that our generation will be responsible for solving.
1001654	Limit distributions on homogeneous spaces: Interplay of dynamics and number theory	DMS	ANALYSIS PROGRAM	07/01/2010	06/22/2010	Nimish Shah	OH	Ohio State University	Standard Grant	Bruce P. Palka	06/30/2013	$134,000.00		shah@math.ohio-state.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	Columbus	OH	432101016	6146888735	MPS	1281		$0.00	In a wide variety of questions in number theory one often recognizes symmetries and invariance under group actions; and deep insights can be gained into such problems by understanding dynamics of subgroup actions on homogeneous spaces of Lie groups. In several such instances it is necessary to describe limiting distributions of sequences of translates of smooth measures on submanifolds of homogeneous spaces. Building up further from his earlier work on some typical cases, the principal investigator seeks in this project to develop new techniques in homogeneous dynamics to provide very general natural conditions on the manifolds and translating elements that lead to equidistribution of the limit measures. The work should lead to resolutions of some questions on metric properties of Diophantine approximation, counting integral and rational points on group varieties, and counting points on orbits of geometrically finite groups associated with certain geometric configurations.<br/><br/>From a broader perspective, the research will apply the concepts and methods of ergodic theory and dynamical systems about the long-time behavior of a generic particle in a flow, which is originally a physical problem, to answer questions about deep properties of whole numbers. This conceptual bridge between two very different disciplines uses and influences other areas like representation theory, analysis, and differential geometry, not to mention physics.

1013979	SBIR Phase I: Electronic Reading Tool: Story Interactive Media Player	IIP	SMALL BUSINESS PHASE I	07/01/2010	06/30/2010	John Camacho	TX	Echelon Group, Inc.	Standard Grant	Glenn H.

These components have been shown to have pronounced positive impact on reading comprehension in students that have autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as the greater population. The problem will be attended by creating a tool that goes beyond a single story approach. The project proposes to establish a canvas from which many stories can be created using a structure that incorporates research-based reading strategies and multi-sensory presentation techniques using electronic technologies. Simply stated the basis of modern education is contingent upon reading and comprehension skills therefore it is logical and intuitive that every effort be made toward mastery of this skill set. The outcome of the proposed innovation is a platform that removes technology barriers and encourages high quality development. Utilizing a high resolution 3D graphics rendering engine in focused story presentation broadens the definition of interactive and will allow a deeper immersion in the story, which research suggests is key to using technology to enhance comprehension. <br/><br/>In the U.S. there are over 400,000 school-age youth with ASD. Families and educators of ASD students are the target market for the proposed product. There are few powerful reading and comprehension tools on the market and they have prohibitive costs in that they are expensive and require one-on-one teacher interaction. The proposed innovation will be affordable, downloadable, and used by students with minimal adult supervision. The product will broaden the concept of an interactive book by blending reading with video game technology to strengthen the literal and inferred meanings found in stories. This approach will empower the written word and captivate a reader while integrating testing and aiding of comprehension in real time while reading.

The set of concordance classes forms an abelian group; this project investigates the structure of this concordance group. There are three major facets to the project: (1) Developing a better understanding of known concordance invariants and discovering new invariants, (2) Applying these invariants to classify important families of knots, and (3) Using these results to unravel the underlying structure of the concordance group.<br/><br/>The perspective of classical physics is three-dimensional, focusing on the three spatial dimensions in which we live. Modern physics has a higher-dimensional perspective, for instance including time to create a four-dimensional model of the universe. In the 1960s it was recognized that four-dimensional spaces can be built by gluing together simpler pieces; the way these pieces are glued together can be represented by knots, with the complexity of the resulting space reflected in the complexity of the knots that occur. This proposal is focused on understanding knotting from a four-dimensional perspective. In particular, new tools will be developed, and these will be applied to complete our four-dimensional analysis of low- crossing number knots.

Lafont, Michael<br/>W. Davis, Pedro Ontaneda<br/><br/>This is a proposal to provide funding for the conference<br/>Geometry, Topology and Dynamics in Negative Curvature to be held<br/>in Bangalore, India, during the week of August 2-7, 2010. The<br/>conference is an official satellite conference to the 2010<br/>International Conference of Mathematicians (held in Hyderabad,<br/>India). The goal of this conference is to bring together<br/>mathematicians working on different aspects of negatively curved<br/>spaces. It will bring together three distinct communities of<br/>mathematicians: geometers, topologists, and dynamicists. It will<br/>provide a forum for sharing the most recent developments in the<br/>study of spaces of negative (and more generally, non-positive)<br/>curvature. A selection of topics that will be touched upon in the<br/>conference include: (1) Gromov hyperbolic groups, CAT(0)-groups,<br/>and geometric group theory, (2) spaces of metrics (Teichmuller<br/>space, moduli space, representation varieties), (3) links with<br/>3-dimensional topology (Geometrization conjecture, mapping class<br/>groups), (4) links with high-dimensional topology (Novikov<br/>conjecture, Borel conjecture), (5) analysis on boundaries of<br/>groups and spaces, (6) Anosov flows and dynamics, (7) flows on<br/>homogeneous spaces and applications to number theory. We expect<br/>the conference to provide a snapshot of the current state of<br/>our knowledge in matters related to nonpositively curved spaces,<br/>as well as to provide a roadmap for future research in this<br/>interdisciplinary field.<br/><br/>Curvature is a fundamental notion in geometry. Zero curvature is<br/>the most physically familiar, and corresponds to an ordinary flat<br/>surface. Positive and negative curvature can be described<br/>relative to the familiar zero curvature setting as follows: one<br/>tries to flatten the surface near a point, and looks to see if<br/>there is too little or too much fabric to achieve the<br/>flattening. For instance, the surface of a cone or of a cylinder<br/>can be unfolded to lie flat, so these also have zero curvature.<br/>But if one tries to flatten the surface of a sphere (think of the<br/>skin of an orange), there is not enough fabric to do this<br/>(i.e. the skin of the orange splits), which corresponds to<br/>positive curvature. Alternatively, if one tries to flatten a<br/>saddle shaped surface, folds appear. There is too much fabric,<br/>which corresponds to negative curvature. A space of nonpositive<br/>curvature can now be described as one having the property that,<br/>near every point and for every pair of directions, it looks<br/>either flat or like a saddle shaped surface. Surprisingly, such<br/>spaces are much more prevalent than one would initially<br/>guess. Aside from the field of geometry, they naturally appear in<br/>numerous other fields of mathematics: topology, dynamics, number<br/>theory, representation theory, etc. Aspects of nonpositive<br/>curvature have also made an increasing appearance in more applied<br/>fields, wherever there has been an interest in understanding the<br/>shape of objects (special relativity theory, crystalline<br/>structures in organic chemistry, configuration spaces in<br/>robotics, etc). This conference will bring together international<br/>experts working on various aspects of nonpositively curved<br/>spaces. The conference web site is http://www.icts.res.in/program/gtdnc.

Ultra Wide Band radio is a promising technology for intra-vehicle wireless control and communications applications since it is capable of achieving high-speed and robust transmissions within a short distance. However, in-vehicle channels introduce dense and extended multi-path components into received signals, and are sensitive to the movement of drivers and passengers. Hence existing Ultra Wide Band technologies need to be redesigned when applied to an in-vehicle environment. This collaborative project firstly addresses the differential code shifted reference technology to capture more signal energy without performing channel estimation leading to an enhanced bit-error rate performance in a low complexity. Secondly, cognitive Ultra Wide Band radio will be used to proactively eliminate various in-band narrowband interferences. Finally, intra-vehicle control and communications systems necessitate an innovative research strategy and design methodology in order to meet the requirement on the coexistence of reliable real-time control message delivery and high-speed date communications.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This collaborative project will improve the education quality of electrical engineering and technology programs by involving undergraduate and graduate students and will attract students, especially those from minority groups, to the fields of science, mathematics, engineering, and technology through seminars and demonstrations. Moreover, the research will help American automotive companies become the worldwide leaders in intra-vehicle wireless control and communications applications, save costs up to billions of dollars per year, enhance the reliability of American made vehicles, offer customers attractive features for informatics and entertainments, and ultimately boost the sales of American automotive products. Lastly, the outcomes of the research can be easily extended to other American industrial sectors, and hence increase the high-tech ingredient of American industry.

The approach is to employ a set of finite-element and plane-wave-expansion techniques to provide accurate multi-scale simulation and analytical description of the electromagnetism in anisotropic metamaterials, starting from nanometer scales of metamaterial units, to micrometer scales of optical devices, to millimeter scales of integrated photonic circuits. <br/>Intellectual merit<br/>The emerging area of negative refractive index media has already resulted in revision of such fundamental laws of nature as refraction and diffraction. Anisotropy-based waveguides, which form the backbone of the proposed research, provide solutions to two fundamental problems associated with conventional negative-index systems: resonant absorption and sensitivity to fabrication imperfections. The proposed research will address the fundamental properties of anisotropic negative-index systems, including coupling between micro- and nanoscale structures, sub-diffraction manipulation of optical signals, and evolution of optical nonlinearities. <br/>Broader impacts <br/>From the fundamental standpoint, proposed research will have its implications in physics (light-matter interaction), biology and chemistry (imaging, sensing, spectroscopy), and engineering (optical computing). From the educational standpoint, proposed activities will lead to an updated curriculum and interactive Java-based tutorial, reflecting recent developments in metamaterials and negative refraction. From the societal standpoint, the proposed research has a potential to revolutionize the areas of sensing, imaging, and communications.

The innovation is the optimization of a pulsed electric field to an algal culture. The main activities of the Phase 1 project will be to develop the pulsed electric field device, optimize the parameters, and assess cost effectiveness. The long term goal is to integrate the optimized pulsed electric field system with the algal bio-fuel industry.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be that successful development of the proposed pulsed electric field system and its integration with the algal bio-fuel system will have a positive impact on the algae-derived bio-fuel industry, if proven cost effective. The benefits of PEF processing in biofuel production are simple and straightforward. If PEF<br/>pretreatment can reduce the costs of producing biofuels, these renewable energy sources become more competitive with petroleum products. The resulting increased demand for biofuels reduces the demand for imported oil, and keeps energy dollars in the US economy. As the oil price spike last summer<br/>demonstrated, adoption of alternative, renewable fuels will happen extremely rapidly once they are less costly than oil.

This includes determining control inputs which optimally reset a neuron's phase by driving the state of the neuron to a phaseless set at which it is very sensitive to noise. When neurons in a population receive such a common stimulus, the noise serves to randomize the neurons' phases, thereby desychronizing the population. In this control scheme, such inputs will be triggered by the detection of population-level synchrony, giving an event-based feedback control algorithm for which the biological tissue is only stimulated when necessary, thereby reducing the overall accumulation of negative side effects of electrical stimulation, and also the amount of power used. In an alternative approach, nonlinear hybrid control, involving the application of a series of different control laws, will be used to break neural synchrony by stabilizing the splay state for the coupled neuron system, which is the state for which the neurons' phases are evenly distributed. Such control will also be generalized to an event-based framework, and optimized so that it minimizes the total input energy or the total time needed to reach the splay state. The robustness of the control algorithms will be explored with respect to uncertainties in the neuron model, uncertainties in the measurements of the firing events, different types of coupling, changes to the input stimulus, heterogeneity of the stimulus due to proximity to the electrode, and properties of the noise.<br/><br/>There is evidence that the tremors associated with Parkinson's disease are associated with the pathological synchronization of neurons in the motor control region of the patient's brain. An FDA-approved treatment for such tremors, called deep brain stimulation, involves the implantation of an electrode into this region, which is used to inject electrical current into the brain tissue. As presently implemented, the electrical current is typically a periodic sequence of pulses with a frequency around 100 Hertz, which has been shown empirically to be an effective treatment for some patients. This research will use engineering techniques, mathematical principles, and state-of-the-art computer simulations to develop the theoretical foundation for alternative electrical current stimuli for deep brain stimulation, which could lead to better treatments for Parkinson's disease. In particular, control algorithms will be developed which minimize the amount of current injected, which will minimize tissue damage and energy consumption, the latter reducing the need for surgery to replace the battery which is used for deep brain stimulation. This will also include the use of feedback control, in which the state of the neural population is monitored by an electrode and the electrical current stimulus is only injected as needed.

However, the measured thermal transport properties of CNT mats and films range from those characteristic of thermal insulators to effective heat conductors. The objective of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of how the thermal properties of composite mats, films and other structures that consist of thousands of interacting CNTs depend on the structural arrangement of the CNTs. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: A model will be developed to simulate the coupled thermal, structural, and mechanical effects that ultimately determine the thermal transport properties of CNT-based nanocomposites. The model will include description of tube-to-tube interactions, and atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations will be used to guide the design of a mesoscopic model. Systematic analyses will reveal the relationship between the CNT structure and thermal transport properties of the nanocomposite material. The effect of mechanical deformation of CNT-based materials on heat transfer will also be investigated and related to the changes in the structural characteristics of the materials. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: This research may be useful in modeling other types of nanofiber and nanowire structures, as well as in computational studies of biological systems. The educational program involves student participation in various aspects of high-performance computing, incorporation of the research results into graduate and upper-undergraduate courses, and the development of an interactive web-site that will provide a non-technical description of general concepts of the linkage between heat transfer and the mechanical behavior of CNT-reinforced nanocomposite materials to a broad audience.

Warr	02/28/2014	$392,635.00		bvogel@umaryland.edu	620 W Lexington St, 4th Floor	Baltimore	MD	212011508	4107063559	BIO	1114	1132, 7465, 9183, BIOT, 1114	$0.00	Nearly all multi-cellular organisms have mechanisms that allow specific tissues to withstand substantial mechanical stress without rupture or permanent deformation. These mechanisms often involve structures composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (e.g. elastin and fibrillin) that assemble into elastic fibers or elastic fiber-like structures that can stretch and flex but return to their original shape once force is removed. Information obtained from studies of elastic polymers found in nature has numerous potential applications in materials science, medicine and military projects (e.g. in tissue grafts, protective clothing and energy-absorbing soundproofing). The PI and co-workers have discovered novel elastic fiber-like structures in the nematode C. elegans that connect pharynx and adjacent muscle cells, and have named these structures nematode elastic fibers (NEFs). As the animals forage for food, NEFs stretch, bend, flex and pivot and help to position the pharynx in the center of the body cavity. In previous work, Dr. Vogel has identified two essential components of the NEF: the highly conserved ECM proteins hemicentin and fibulin-1D. These proteins co-assemble at NEFs and two other cell junctions that are also flexible and resistant to mechanical stress. The specific aims of the current proposal utilize the power of the C. elegans genetic system to: 1) dissect the mechanism of hemicentin and fibulin-1D assembly into NEFs and 2) determine the composition of these intriguing elastic polymers by identifying the other molecular NEF components. The long-term goals are to define the essential requirements for assembling NEFs, to assemble NEFs or NEF-like structures in vitro and a detailed analysis of the mechanical/biophysical properties of these intriguing structures. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit lies in the potential to provide detailed information into the assembly and composition of a novel type of cell junction. Although cell-cell and cell-ECM junctions have been the focus of intense investigation, hemicentin and fibulin-1D are unique in that they always assemble in a sandwich at junctions between cells (cell-ECM-cell) where they form a novel type of elastic and flexible biological glue.<br/><br/>There are two aspects of broader impacts that pertain to this project. One is the potential for societal benefit through the likelihood that the work will have relevance for materials science and bioengineering of synthetic biocompatible elastic materials that would be useful in a variety of applications. In addition to the potential utility of the research itself, another broader impact of the proposed research will be to utilize C. elegans as an ideal model organism to teach basic concepts in biology. In conjunction with the experimental goals of the research, molecular biology and genetics learning modules will be developed for UMBIs established, state-wide science education program. This program consists of three components that serve Maryland K-12 students: 1) UMBIs on-site teaching laboratory 2) Maryland Loaner Lab (MDLL) in which the necessary equipment and consumables are sent to teachers so they can enhance their lab offerings and integrate new curriculum in their classrooms and 3) a 32-station mobile teaching laboratory housed in a tractor trailer that travels throughput the state of Maryland to provide hands-on laboratory education for K-12 students. An additional benefit is that separate teacher professional development programs are available through all three components designed to provide teachers with an opportunity to expand their laboratory skills and enhance the content of their bioscience instruction.

The National Energy Plan Renewable Fuel Standard mandates the production of 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels from non-food based crops by 2022. In order to achieve this goal, an economically feasible process to hydrolyze biomass must be developed. Production of cellulosic ethanol currently involves pretreating biomass with steam, acid or base to make it more accessible to enzymatic digestion. Enzymes, namely those possessing cellulase, xylanase, ‚-xylosidase and ‚-glucosidase activities, will be added after pretreatment to hydrolyze the biomass to its constituent five and six carbon sugars that can be fermented to produce fuel.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be low cost bio-fuel made from local biomass. This could reduce and stabilize energy prices, strengthen the national energy security, reduce the fiscal deficit, create American jobs and promote economic development.

Accordingly, the need arises for fundamental research in critical cognition infrastructure to sense, learn, and adapt to the environment CR networks operate. This proposal aims to develop this infrastructure for comprehensive situation awareness through the novel notion of RF cartography. Paralleling the success of routing tables, the vision is to jointly utilize interference and channel gains maps to identify opportunistically available bands for re-use, and handoff operation; localize and track user activities; as well control resource allocation and routing decisions. The approach draws from contemporary advances in sparsity-aware regression, compressive sampling, basis expansions, spline interpolation, and kriged Kalman filtering. The project leverages these tools to investigate: (a) distributed, online, and adaptive algorithms for map estimation and tracking; (b) training-based and blind cartography options; (c) spatio-temporal spectrum re-use, and localization in the presence of multipath and shadowing effects; and, (d) cartography-driven network utility maximization for optimal cross-layer design of CR networks.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research is of interest to software radio designs with IEEE 802.11 compliant standards. In a broader sense, advances in sparsity-aware regression, kriging, splines, and spectrum cartography will permeate benefits to a gamut of areas as diverse as machine learning and data mining for social networks, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, surveillance using wireless sensor networks, as well as navigation and safety systems. Cognition in networking and localization applications will further provide meaningful experiences to undergraduates and integration of the expertise gained to enhance the content of graduate classes. Outreach to the government and industrial sectors will be possible through short courses, tutorials in workshops and conferences, and student-faculty-staff collaboration.

The topics to be investigated are: small viscosity regime of second grade fluids; uniqueness of weak solutions for certain linear perturbations of the two-dimensional Euler equations; the vanishing viscosity limit of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with helical symmetry; the search for hypotheses on the structure of invariant measures or stationary statistical solutions of the two and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with anomalous dissipation; the search for energy cascade for flows in domains with physical boundaries; two-dimensional cascades with large gap bimodal forcing. Turbulence is a common phenomenon in fluid motion, in which macroscopic quantities (velocity, pressure, temperatures, etc.) no longer have a deterministic relation with global parameters of the flow. Direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows at large Reynolds numbers, that occur in practical applications, such as in geophysical modeling and mixing in industrial processes, are out of reach even for the state-of-the-art computer power. Therefore, there is an urgent need to pursue this challenging problem analytically, by developing rigorous mathematical and statistical tools to investigate it, and to test these tools computationally. <br/><br/>While turbulence is an everyday occurrence, our understanding is still lacking in many aspects. Quantifying the effect of small scales on the dynamics of large scales is fundamental in modern multiscale science. The goal of the project is to enable a predictive analytical study of turbulent flows. This study will impact wide-ranging applications, from geophysical modeling, such as dispersion of pollutants in the ocean, to biological and industrial modeling, such as design of polymeric materials. The project will consolidate the well-established collaborative efforts of the principal investigators with their Brazilian counterparts, and may lead to new collaboration, especially among the junior research personnel. International collaboration among scientists is a key to economic competitiveness in global markets. Four US and three Brazilian academic institutions are involved in the project. The international dimension of the project is further emphasized through two planned workshops. Training and supervision of at least six Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows is also achieved through planned summer schools and scientific workshops. Students and postdoctoral fellows from the US will travel to Brazil to participate in the workshops and the summer schools and interact with the US and Brazilian researchers.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded with the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering.

Standard Grant	Anthony Walters	12/31/2010	$150,000.00		ccalvert@fando.com	146 Hartford Road	Manchester	CT	060405992	8606462469	ENG	5371	1401, 5371, 9163, AMPP	$0.00	This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on the development of a novel MnO2 cathode catalyst for power generation and wastewater treatment in microbial fuel cells (MFCs); an emerging biotechnology for generation of electricity from wastewater treatment facilities. Currently, development of MFCs is impeded by the cathode reaction, which is the rate-limiting step in MFCs. Current cathode material is platinum based, which is costly and relatively scarce. Fouling of the cathode decreases the cathode effectiveness and increases maintenance costs. A MnO2-cathode catalyst will be developed to enhance the cathode reaction rate, reduce costs, and minimize fouling. The catalyst will incorporate metal additives to enhance the reaction, have an anti-fouling coating to minimize fouling, and be prepared as a monolithic material. The developed cathode will be tested in laboratory-scale systems and a continuous-flow pilot-scale MFC system treating actual wastewater from a wastewater treatment plant. <br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the removal of a key hurdle that has impeded commercialization of MFCs. A lower cost and more effective catalyst is a key component for bringing MFC technology to a cost that will be commercially attractive to any wastewater treatment facility. The anaerobic MFC has the advantage over an aerobic process due to less power consumption and reduced sludge volume. The initial cost of the MFC and the maintenance would be offset by the reduction of electricity consumed from the power grid. The development of a cost-effective MFC system has the potential for significant impact on energy and environmental sustainability and could eventually lead to for self-sustainable wastewater treatment plant.

1007514	Optimal Control Problems with Time-Inconsistency and Related Topics	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS, COFFES	07/01/2010	11/13/2014	Jiongmin Yong	FL	University of Central Florida	Standard Grant	Mary Ann Horn	07/31/2015	$177,116.00		jiongmin.yong@ucf.edu	4000 CNTRL FLORIDA BLVD	ORLANDO	FL	328168005	4078230387	MPS	1266, 7552		$0.00	This project is to establish a general theory of continuous-time optimal control problems (both deterministic and stochastic), for which the state equation and the cost functional are parameterized by the initial time and/or the initial state. For this type of problem, an optimal control/strategy, if it exists, will also depend on the initial time and/or the initial state. Therefore, in general, it will no longer be optimal immediately after the initial time. This feature is referred to as the time-inconsistency. To find time-consistent solutions to the time-inconsistent problem, the investigator will introduce a method of multi-person hierarchical differential games. It is expected that the limiting game as the number of players goes to infinity should lead to a time-consistent equilibrium control/strategy to the original problem. With such a general approach, this project will carefully investigate the following cases: (1) State equation is a linear ordinary differential equation or stochastic differential equation and the cost functional is convex. For such a case, the quasi-Riccati equation technique will be applied/extended to find the time-consistent equilibrium control; (2) State equation is a stochastic differential equation with the cost functional containing some functions of conditional expectation of the state. For such a case, the problem will be transformed to a controlled forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) parameterized by the initial time and the initial state. Proper techniques involving maximum principle and dynamic programming, including stochastic partial differential equations, will be developed to solve the problem; (3) State equation is a stochastic Volterra integral equation. For such a case, the theory of backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIE) recently developed by the investigator will play an essential role, and time-consistent solution will be expected by combining the theory of BSVIEs and multi-person differential games. <br/><br/>In real world, as time goes by, it is common that people change their minds or objectives in what can be described as an inconsistent way (due to, for example, change of income and/or living standard, etc.). Similarly, various changes of the environment (advances of technology, new limits of resources, etc.) lead people to inconsistently modifying their ways of running business from time to time. In both cases, one faces time-inconsistent problems, yet time-consistent strategies are desirable. The above considerations served the main motivation of the research in this project.<br/><br/>Mathematically, this project will substantially enrich the general theory of deterministic and stochastic optimal control theory from a new aspect. It will have impact on stochastic analysis, mathematical finance, optimal control theory, and differential games. From the point-of-view of applications, the theories developed in this project will provide useful insights for time-inconsistency, nonlinear preferences, and dynamic cumulative prospect theory, etc. Therefore, the results will provide principles for people who are handling problems of optimal investment, asset pricing, risk management, resource (such as oil, power, etc.) allocation, production planning, etc. The expected results will be of interest to relevant theoretic researchers, practitioners in various type industries, as well as a number of government agencies.
1009197	RUI: Integral Equations with Delay; Optimal Control and Applications	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	07/01/2010	06/25/2010	Natali Hritonenko	TX	Prairie View A&M Research Foundation	Standard Grant	Mary Ann Horn	06/30/2013	$56,444.00		nahritonenko@pvamu.edu	P O Box 667	Prairie View	TX	774462818	9362611640	MPS	1266	9229	$0.00	The project will develop a new innovative approach to model complex dynamics processes in technology, biology, ecology, economics, and the environmental sciences. While many models have arisen in these disciplines, mathematical theory is far behind fast growing application needs. The distinguishing feature of the problems under study is the optimal control of endogenous delays. These delays reflect the age of individuals to be harvested or the lifetime of obsolete equipment to be replaced due to technological innovations. While such models have immense potential for applied sciences, prior use has primarily been restricted due to the assumption of constant delays. The use of variable endogenous delays will provide greater modeling flexibility and open new horizons in qualitative analysis of the models. Optimal control with endogenous delays will be reduced to the analysis of integral equations with unknown upper limits of integration. Such equations represent a completely new mathematical object and will be part of the study. Thus, the project outcomes will enhance both mathematics with new results in the optimal control and integral equations and applications with new investigation techniques relevant to applications. <br/><br/>Models based on equations with delay are currently employed by various interdisciplinary groups of scientists in economic growth theory, operations research, management sciences, environmental protection, life sciences, population biology, and related areas. The developed methods will be beneficial to these fields and lead to deeper analysis of many phenomena. As a consequence, the research will foster collaboration among scientists from different countries and disciplines and stimulate new contacts. Societal benefits include the ability to allocate usage of novel technological inventions and optimal management of natural resources under environmental and climate changes. The project also will attract attention of mathematical community to new applications and increase participation of African-American undergraduates in research. These students will be involved in all research activities and will present at conferences.

The heat transfer rates are ultimately determined by boundary layer-type flow along the in-cylinder walls. The underlying physical mechanisms within these boundary layers are still not well understood. A paucity of detailed measurements of gas velocity and temperature distributions adjacent to the walls has hindered the development of models that could be used for design purposes.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This research will generate detailed experimental information regarding the velocity and temperature distributions within highly-transient boundary layers that occur within internal combustion engines. Velocity data will be acquired using a micro-particle image velocimetry technique with a high repetition rate laser source. Temperature distributions will be determined using laser induced fluorescence. Ensemble-averaged velocity and temperature data will be determined, as will two-point, auto-, and cross-correlation of parameters over a relatively wide range of operating parameters for transparent engine tests in both the motored and fired modes. Wall heat flux data will be simultaneously acquired. The data will be used by collaborators to develop and validate computational models of this complex and highly transient phenomena.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The ability to understand and predict wall heat transfer in internal combustion engines is a key element necessary to reduce pollutant formation and increase fuel efficiency in future engine designs. This research will involve graduate student training, including an international experience for the student. Undergraduate students will also work with collaborators at the Technical University of Darmstadt. The graduate student will participate in various initiatives aimed at preparing women for careers in engineering. Broad dissemination to non-traditional audiences is also planned.

Dixie Highway Suite 650	CORAL GABLES	FL	331462926	3052843924	MPS	7970		$0.00	The PI proposes to study combinatorial aspects of root systems and reflection groups. This subject has been gaining importance, and the recent book of Bj\orner and Brenti (Combinatorics of Coxeter groups, Springer 2005) suggests that it has reached critical mass. In particular, there is a new subject of Catalan phenomena in Coxeter groups, which has coalesced from three topics: Garside structures and classifying spaces for braid groups (in terms of noncrossing partitions); the cluster algebras of Fomin and Zelevinsky; and the combinatorics of diagonal harmonics, which arose from conjectures of Garsia and Haiman. The broad goal of the proposal is to explore and develop connections between these areas.<br/><br/>This research occurs in the field of algebraic combinatorics. Combinatorics is the science of counting, arranging, and analyzing discrete structures. Historically, these discrete structures have come from computers --- from hardware, software, and computer networks --- hence the field of combinatorics has really emerged as a central area of mathematics in the last fifty years. More recently, the increasing speed of computers has allowed the use of combinatorial techniques in many areas of science --- in particular, in the analysis of genetic data and DNA structure. Algebraic combinatorics seeks to enrich the subject by incorporating ideas from more abstract, algebraic areas of mathematics. One such example is the braid group, which has led to a popular new method of cryptography.

This research builds upon the viability of classic conjugate addition chemistry to establish, under reversible conditions, carbon frameworks of elaborate overall structure. In particular, the formation of topologically complex organic molecules-rotaxanes and catenanes-is facilitated via this approach, opening a straightforward route to materials with potentially valuable imaging and sensing properties.<br/><br/>With support from this award students at Mount Holyoke, an undergraduate only women's college, work on projects that span organic synthesis, structural analysis, and investigations of the properties of new materials. A premium is placed on establishing concise, inexpensive, modular methods of broad general applicability to the preparation of materials for contemporary problems such as sensing and imaging. Contributions to US competitiveness in these fields is derived from both the specific research undertaken with support from this award, and from the preparation of new generations of undergraduates trained in emerging areas of synthetic and materials chemistry. Collaborations with local high school teachers are supported with the intention of drawing illustrative components of the research into laboratory teaching.

A combination of system testing and component testing will be used to assess the behavior of these systems as designed today. These experimental results will then be used to advance models for the analysis of such systems under large deformations and to identify critical details that have a major impact on system performance. Cost-effective details that transform performance will be developed and tested at the component level and then incorporated in system tests. At the component level, steel connections will be tested under combined rotation and tension loading, and important details of the slab on deck system, such as lap splices, beam anchorage, and the tensile behavior of the slabs on metal decks in orthogonal directions will be tested. System tests will involve large-scale push-down tests of gravity frame systems using current practice details and new concepts developed in this research.<br/><br/>The results of this research will directly impact the safety of almost all steel buildings by assessing the integrity of ubiquitous structural components and developing models for engineers to employ. It will also develop transformative solutions for improving the robustness of common gravity frame components and systems. Through close collaboration with the American Institute of Steel Construction, expedient dissemination and rapid implementation will be facilitated. Graduate students will be directly trained through this research as they address the challenges associated with unanticipated structural loadings. Interest and diversity in engineering will be enhanced through partnerships with the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program at Purdue, the Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP) at Illinois and the Seattle Mathematics Engineering Science and Achievement Program (Seattle MESA) at Washington. These programs will provide for undergraduate (SURF and SROP) and high school (MESA) research internships.

Gholz	06/30/2012	$49,806.00		P-Geddes@neiu.edu	5500 N Saint Louis Avenue	Chicago	IL	606254669	7734424670	BIO	1181	1181, 9169, EGCH	$0.00	Invasive species are a serious concern for natural systems, mostly because they usually result in a decline of biodiversity. However, we know relatively little about how these invasive species affect other aspects of ecosystems. In particular, we lack knowledge about how plant invasive species may affect ecosystem services performed by the ecosystems they invade. Several plant species possess invasive strains that are more aggressive than their native counterparts. Yet relationships between native and invasive strains and their effects on ecosystem processes have not been thoroughly explored. This project addresses the effects of an aggressive invader, giant reed (Phragmites australis), on nutrient cycling, an important ecosystem process. The success in Phragmites spread has been attributed to changes in the patterns of land use, nutrient enrichment, and altered hydrological regimes. More recently, it has been speculated that its invasiveness could also be attributed to an invasive and more aggressive European strain. Although several studies on the effect of Phragmites australis on nutrient cycling have been conducted, they have mostly concentrated on brackish marshes and/or have not distinguished between native and exotic plant strains. Thus, the main goal of this study is to investigate the relationship between plant invasion and nutrient dynamics (with emphasis on the nitrogen cycle) by exploring if nutrient cycling differs among native plant communities and invasive and native strains of Phragmites australis in freshwater wetlands. <br/><br/>The potential for the proposed project to complement and broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in science as well as to improve the quality of research and research training at Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) is substantial. NEIU is a federally designated Hispanic-Serving institution (HSI) serving the Chicago metropolitan area, where ~27% of its students are Hispanic and many are first-generation college attendees. Through this project, NEIU will partner with researchers from the Chicago Botanic Gardens and Northwestern University, catalyzing a productive collaboration and broadening research impacts even further. In addition, the proposed project not only enhances research capabilities but will also positively affect curricular development and student preparation at several educational levels. The materials and instrumentation from the proposed project will be incorporated into: 1) the undergraduate biology curriculum to enhance the academic experience of students at NEIU and to better prepare them for graduate school, and 2) into the science curriculum at a neighboring high school of the Chicago Public Schools system (Northside College Prep High School).

Recent research revealed the presence of cacao residues in ceramics from refuse deposits at Pueblo Bonito, Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, dated to A.D. 1000-1125. This finding demonstrates the presence of cacao, a tropical product, in the American Southwest. However, knowledge of cacao use in this region is limited by the fact that only five sherds from one site have been analyzed, with cacao recovered from three of those. Cacao may have been widely traded beyond Pueblo Bonito, particularly in conjunction with the exchange in Scarlet Macaws, another tropical species known to be widely present in the Southwest from A.D. Cacao may have been present earlier and later than the Pueblo Bonito materials.<br/><br/>To determine the extent of cacao use and the nature of cacao exchange networks in the American Southwest, pottery from other sites and other time periods will be tested for cacao residues. To understand how cacao was consumed, testing will also be completed for additives traditionally used in Mesoamerican cacao drinks, such as honey. Decisions about which areas to test will follow three assumptions. First, to get to Chaco, exchange from Mesoamerica likely followed routes either through southwestern New Mexico, southern Arizona, or up the Rio Grande. Second, exchange in cacao likely accompanied exchange in macaws, because these biological species came from the same tropical environments, so pottery from sites with macaws will be given priority in sampling. Finally, because cacao consumption elsewhere in the New World always involved special vessel shapes, testing will focus on special vessel forms that likely functioned as drinking vessels for each area. <br/><br/>High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry will be used to test for the presence of theobromine, a biomarker for Theobroma cacao in the paste of the pottery. For samples with evidence for theobromine, additional testing will be conducted to identify any other components of the cacao beverage. The analysis will be conducted at the Core Facility, MS Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the research includes assessing the prehispanic distribution of cacao in the American Southwest, furthering knowledge of exchange relationships between the Southwest and Mesoamerica, and evaluating how widespread cacao use might have been in ritual activities in the Southwest. <br/><br/>The research will create interdisciplinary interaction between the University of New Mexico, the Hershey Center for Health and Nutrition, the MS Hershey Medical Center, and several museums contributing sherds to this research. The results will be widely disseminated in the popular press and scholarly publications. Previous research on this topic received extensive media attention.

With increasing use of Li ion batteries, safety is of particular concern as reports of occasional injuries appear in the news due to a short circuit, cell overcharge, or other overheating related catastrophic events. A separator medium having a reversible thermal shutdown mechanism means that Li ion batteries can automatically be shutdown before a thermal runaway incident occurs and can automatically be restarted once a safe thermal environment is restored. A Li ion battery separator with the targeted built-in reversible thermal shutdown capability not only addresses safety, but is also expected to extend the active life of a battery. The technical objectives of this project are to identify a suitable polymer material, optimize its material characteristics, and investigate the factors related to the reversible thermal shutdown, mechanical stability and durability. The polymer nanofiber web will be subjected to thermal cycling and the reversible thermal shutdown characteristics will be evaluated using impedance measurements. In this project, the composition and structure of a durable electrospun polymer nanofiber web with a reversible thermal shutdown characteristic will be identified.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project, if successful, will be an improvement in safety for Li ion batteries. This innovation has a direct impact on the safety of users. Moreover, the tendency to overheat also impacts Li Ion battery operations. The associated costs to address both issues have continued to be a barrier for wider adoption of Li Ion batteries, and thus, the successful outcome of this project also has the potential of lowering the cost of the battery technology. Development of a separator with reversible thermal shutdown capability will help lessen the hurdles that are deterring the Li Ion battery technology from achieving its potential in a forecasted $7 billion end user market. This collaboration between the small business and an academic partner involves a post-doctoral scientist at the academic institution, who will gain commercially relevant research experience.

Studies reveal two pressing needs: to<br/>. Improve research tools for observing first responders interactions in complex socio-technical contexts and<br/>. Develop computer tools and methodologies that support these interactions.<br/>MICL will consist of six main components: a mobile coordination post built on a truck chassis, a customized light hovercraft vehicle, two personal mobile platforms, two robotic miniature helicopters, two miniature ground robotic systems, and ten personal rugged wearable computer systems. All components will be equipped with robust and interoperable communication hardware, data persistence, and audio/video capture and processing devices, with related software to securely capture, store, transmit, and provide feedback regarding on-scene data gathering in chaotic environments. Currently, researchers are compelled to use stationary laboratories away from the disaster site to conduct inherently dynamic and mobile research; MICL should facilitate work in location affected by extreme events. This work supports <br/>. Understanding of underlying principles, adequate uses of IT and appropriate algorithms that govern interaction among diverse responders and organizations;<br/>. Integration of secure data models & communication frameworks that support group interactions in extreme conditions;<br/>. Development of a computer infrastructure to support interactions among first responders to reduce the negative impacts that extreme events have on homeland security and national economy;<br/>. Integration of many academic areas including civil engineering, architecture, computer science, sociology, business, education that focus on interactions of key users in chaotic contexts, bringing real-world challenges.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Addressing needs benefiting national security, this infrastructure provides first responders aid to address critical issues such as security and vulnerability, along with expertise to prepare, respond, and recover from disaster. Moreover, it addresses education and training in this vibrant area.

Thermoplastic hydrogels are not available commercially and would be of great interest because, unlike conventional cross-linked hydrogel materials, they can be processed from solution or thermally into any form/shape via solvent casting, extrusion, thermoforming or hot melt injection. The proposed technology innovation will be achieved by the design of a series of amphiphilic graft copolymers with well-defined, adjustable macromolecular architectures with and without antimicrobial pendant groups along the chain. The project will explore a range of chemical compositions with variations in the chemical nature and concentration of hydrophobic grafts. The base polymer, poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline), is a commercially available polymer that is thermally stable, amorphous, water soluble, extrudable polymer. Physical crosslinks will be achieved by microphase separation. In the presence of water the hydrophilic backbone will swell. The degree of swelling and mechanical properties will be controlled by adjusting the macromolecular architecture tailored to the desired application requirements.<br/><br/>What are the broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project?<br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project will be to develop processible hydrogels tailored for specific applications for wound care, water purification membranes, ink jet receptive layers for printing and thermoform contact lenses. The ability to tailor the properties of these materials by controlled synthetic methods using living polymerization methods will greatly enhance their utility to serve these diverse industries. Thermoplastic hydrogels can be processed, whereas cross-linked hydrogels are insoluble and infusible. Low cost processing methods such as thermoforming, injection molding or extrusion offer significant economic advantage over many current hydrogel products on the market. Moreover, the ability to adjust the composition and tailor the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature and microphase separation, which controls the degree of swelling, will enable the optimization of performance for a wide range of potential applications. The incorporation of non-leaching antimicrobial groups along the chain will enhance their utility in wound care and water purification membranes. Investigation of the surface and bulk morphology correlated to physical and thermo-mechanical data will help to obtain a better understanding of structure-property relationship of amphiphilic graft copolymers as a function of composition and observed morphology.

The<br/>one-day workshop has been especially beneficial for junior graduate students, giving them a supportive<br/>environment in which to present their research (in many cases, for the first time) and enabling them to<br/>meet peers and more senior researchers in the field of machine learning. The networking opportunities<br/>provided by the workshop have also helped senior graduate students find jobs following graduation.<br/>Intellectual Merit: This workshop will advance machine learning knowledge and foster collaboration<br/>within the machine learning community. As invited speakers, established researchers at top universities<br/>and research labs will teach workshop participants about cutting-edge ideas from diverse areas of<br/>machine learning. Students will present their own research and receive valuable feedback from both<br/>senior researchers and their peers. By enabling women at all stages of their careers in machine learning to<br/>exchange research ideas and form new relationships, we expect that new connections and research<br/>collaborations will be established, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art of the field.<br/>Broader Impact: This workshop will provide a forum for female graduate students, postdoctoral fellows,<br/>junior and senior faculty, and industry and government research scientists to exchange research ideas and<br/>establish networking and mentoring relationships. Undergraduates, particularly those who are interested<br/>in pursuing graduate school or industry positions in machine learning, are also welcome to attend.<br/>Bringing together women from different stages of their careers gives established researchers the<br/>opportunity to act as mentors, and enables junior women to find female role models working in the field<br/>of machine learning. The workshop will also benefit the wider machine learning community: Firstly, the<br/>WiML website, which lists all previous workshop presenters, serves as a useful resource for organizations<br/>looking for female invited speakers. Secondly, co-locating with a major machine learning conference<br/>enhances the visibility of female researchers among the wider machine learning community. Thirdly,<br/>travel funding provided to workshop participants also facilitates their travel to the co-located conference,<br/>which for some participants would otherwise not be possible. Finally, all workshop materials (slides,<br/>abstracts, etc.) will be made available on the workshop website in order to ensure broad dissemination.

Existing sampling and chemical assay field mapping techniques provide only near-surface (<6 inch depth) aerially-sparse data. This allows application of only a coarsely tailored top-dressing of fertilizer. With high-resolution and depth information, fertilizer and soil usage can be fully optimized to reduce cost and maximize yield. The combined benefits of an electronic neutron generator that uses no radioactive material and the elemental analysis capabilities of PGNA would result in a safe and effective soil scanning technology. The primary objective of this Phase I project is to determine the expected sensitivity of the soil analyzer using MCNP modeling. These sensitivity results will, in turn, set the requirements for the neutron generator and gamma-detection systems.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is reduction in overall fertilizer use, ability to improve plant nutrient uptake, and, consequently, higher yields, leading to an estimated value proposition of $8 Billion annually for the agriculture industry (based on 2008 data). A key aspect of Phase I work will be to assess the commercial viability of a PGNA-based soil scanner and gauge market acceptance to determine the expected fraction of this value that can be captured relative to production costs to ascertain commercial feasibility. In addition to monetary returns, reductions in fertilizer run-off and better soil management will yield an environmental payoff in the form of a more sustainable and productive agriculture industry that benefits everyone.

The proposed automated procedure will start with collection of video frames using a high-resolution video camera mounted on an inspector?s hardhat. Then, state-of-the-art detection and extraction algorithms will be employed to detect RC columns and identify and characterize column damage. Component damage will be classified using empirically based models, and component damage will be used to determine the damage state of the building. Building damage state, configuration and type will be used to query a set of fragility curves defining the likelihood of building collapse during an aftershock and, thereby, provide an improved understanding of risk. Deliverables include a catalog of fundamental visible damage characteristics, model-based recognition and analysis tools, demonstration and validation via hardware, documentation of research results, engineering student education, and outreach seminars to building evaluators.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will provide the first robust method in the area of structural member and damage recognition from video. This scientific breakthrough will allow researchers to integrate this work in as-built building information modeling, project monitoring, virtual and augmented reality and other applications of importance to the engineering community. Also, this will be the first known study to quantitatively link visual damage in a building component (column or wall), to the likelihood of building collapse using robust probabilistic methods. The discoveries sought in this project are expected to serve as a foundation for a new knowledge base in damage assessment and to promote intellectual cross-pollination among the fields of computer vision and structural engineering. The results will be disseminated to allow the creation of commercial software that have increased precision, reduced cost, and work with reduced weight devices. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students and K-12 students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research.

In a remarkable series of talks, many by mathematicians with relatively recent PhDs, we saw the implementation and application of derived schemes, derived stacks, higher categories, and the attendant homotopy theory across a broad spectrum of geometric and topological subjects. This new workshop is a follow-up to the 2007 conference: the main point is to revisit the field three years later, to assess what has happened and to to see where we are going. In particular, the field of derived algebraic geometry and its interplay with higher category theory field has grown rapidly since 2007 and is now central to several developing areas of algebraic topology. It is an ideal moment to explore this interplay. Researchers who have agreed to participate include Mark Behrens (MIT), D-C. Cisinski (Paris 13), Ralph Cohen (Stanford), Andre Henriques (Utrecht), Gerd Laures, (Bochum), Tyler Lawson (Minnesota), Mike Mandell (Indiana), Niko Naumann (Regensburg), and Charles Rezk (UIUC).<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is a classical field of mathematics, arising from the study of solutions of systems of polynomial equations in many variables. The focus on polynomials make the geometric objects studied very rigid, in contrast to topology, which is the study of phenomena which remain unchanged under any continuous deformation. Derived algebraic geometry seeks to import techniques from algebraic topology into algebraic geometry in order to capture and calculate some of the finer structure apparently hidden by the inherent rigidity. There have been remarkable recent successes. This grant will be used to fund the attendance of US research mathematicians near the beginning of their careers, in this way promoting the spread of these ideas among the broader research community.

In addition, the project also has the goal of finding an alternative to currently installed catalyst technology that can employ a less expensive and simplified production process.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to capture a bio-fuel from waste products (brown grease) and by-products. The proposed biodiesel catalyst technology shows potential to simultaneously use low cost feedstocks and to greatly simplify the biodiesel production process to achieve cost savings. With these cost savings, retrofitted, currently idled facilities could produce biodiesel fuel below petroleum diesel prices which would help meet the anticipated global market demand of 6 billion gallons of biodiesel by 2012.

Larsen	06/30/2011	$180,000.00		baustrian@qube.com	750 Lindaro Street	San Rafael	CA	949016024	4154648880	ENG	5371	1658, 5371, 9216, HPCC	$0.00	This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to design and develop the BrainSTEM Network, a breakthrough eLearning solution designed to overcome national deficiencies in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and other fundamental academic competencies. Today's antiquated, largely pre-Internet pedagogy fails to empower educators with course creation tools needed to rapidly and economically re-author curricula for the increasingly interactive digital age. Student learners, in turn, endure the absence of effective, engaging or motivational online learning experiences they demand to keep pace with technology's rapid advance and compete for precious attention span. This research seeks to design and develop a working prototype of the BrainSTEM network-based on innovative instructional designs and functional requirements for a transformational course authoring system. The research focuses on the functional tool design required to build educational game-enriched STEM courses that integrate with social networks and online communities. The anticipated Phase I results include completed technology designs, functional prototypes of authoring tools and social network interfaces, as well as a demonstrable STEM content module. <br/><br/><br/>BrainSTEM will enable a comprehensive renovation of curricular content, academic publishing, course delivery and pedagogy as they have existed in the United States since the advent of nationwide public education nearly 100 years ago. Today, the 21st-century digitization or 'Internet enablement' of education is long overdue despite growing economic pressure on educational institutions and a national, if not global, focus on academic competency. BrainSTEM offers the two-fold promise of (1) reinventing education and academic publishing for the Internet age by empowering educators with breakthrough self-publishing tools and (2) promoting viral learner motivation across a demographic of students rapt in electronic games, social networking and wireless devices. Public and private education in the United States reflects roughly $1 trillion in national spending, of which the vast majority is consumed by labor costs. The commercial opportunity for BrainSTEM centers on its ability to help mitigate escalating labor costs using uniquely effective and engaging online courses as a complement to instructor-led education. Information technology enjoys a well-established role, go-to-market and business model in education but only now can revolutionize the commercial value, social appeal and underlying efficacy of curricular content itself.
1023771	Sequence Requirements for Protein-Based Genetic Elements	MCB	Molecular Biophysics	07/01/2010	05/13/2013	Eric Ross	CO	Colorado State University	Continuing grant	Kamal Shukla	06/30/2015	$748,243.00		eric.ross@colostate.edu	601 S Howes St	Fort Collins	CO	805232002	9704916355	BIO	1144	1166, 7465, 9183	$0.00	One of the most fundamental questions in biology is how organisms store and pass on genetic information.  Research in the growing field of epigenetics has demonstrated that genetic information is not always encoded within an organism's DNA sequence.  The discovery of yeast prions showed that changes in protein structure can be used to transmit genetic information.  The formation of yeast prions involves the conversion of soluble proteins into an insoluble amyloid form.  The amyloid form can be stably passed from mother to daughter cell, allowing the encoded epigenetic information to be passed on as a protein-based genetic element.  This project examines the hypothesis that such structural conversions represent a common epigenetic mechanism of cellular regulation and inheritance in eukaryotes.  A combination of in vitro and in vivo assays will be employed to define the sequence features that allow certain proteins to undergo prion-like structural conversions.  This information will then be used to identify novel proteins whose activities are regulated by prion-like structural conversions.  Taken together, these studies will advance our understanding of the role of such structural conversions in eukaryotic regulation and inheritance.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  In addition to the intellectual merit, this project has three major areas of broader impact.  First, much of the research will be conducted in the context of a novel laboratory course, which is designed to be a hybrid of independent research and traditional laboratory classes.  This course will allow students to generate new, publishable research, but in a sufficiently structured setting to allow for training of a large number of students.  The course is designed to offer a diverse interdisciplinary training experience in biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics and bioinformatics.  Second, as yeast are safe and inexpensive to work with, they provide an excellent system for teaching basic concepts of biochemistry and genetics to younger ages.  Therefore, aspects of the research will be used in an elementary school outreach project called Biochemistry is Elementary.  This project introduces students to the scientific process and to basic concepts in biochemistry using exciting, hands-on activities.  Finally, this work involves the development of novel technologies for the quantitative monitoring of prion dynamics, which will have applications for future research into regulatory prions and for industrial applications of amyloid fibrils.

The space AH(M) may be viewed as the 3-dimensional analogue of the Teichmuller space of marked hyperbolic surfaces homeomorphic to a fixed closed surface, while the space AI(M) is the natural analogue of moduli space. Recent work on AH(M) has focussed on the classification of elements in AH (M), e.g. the Ending Lamination Theorem, and the difficulty in understanding the topology of the space, e.g. results establishing that AH(M) need not be locally connected. Prof. Canary proposes a number of projects which study, and attempt to circumscribe, the pathological behavior of the topology of AH(M). The study of AI(M) is still in its infancy, but preliminary results indicate that the topology of AI(M) reflects the topology of M. Prof. Canary proposes to study the topology of AI(M) and the dynamics of the action of the outer automorphism group of the fundamental group of M on AH(M) and, more generally, on the relevant character variety.<br/><br/><br/>Prof. Canary studies the deformation theory of geometric structures on 3-dimensional manifolds. A 2-dimensional manifold is a space which looks locally like the 2- dimensional plane. For example, one may consider surfaces of familiar 3-dimensional objects such as footballs or doughnuts. Similarly, a 3-manifold is a space that looks locally like 3-dimensional Euclidean space. For example, the universe we live in is a 3-dimensional manifold. A geometric structure on a manifold gives a way of measuring distances and angles in a manifold. The study of how geometric structures on manifolds may vary has been a prominent theme in recent work in both mathematics, for example in the solution of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, and physics, for example in string theory. Prof. Canary will study the variation of geometric structures in the setting of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In addition, Prof. Canary will continue his commitment to undergraduate education, by pioneering a new course using inquiry-based methods, and his work mentoring graduate students and postdoctoral assistant professors.
1014139	SBIR Phase I:  Nano Processing of High Temperature Ceramic Oxide Thermoelectric Materials for Enhanced Performance	IIP	SMALL BUSINESS PHASE I	07/01/2010	06/07/2010	Mike Chu	NY	TAM Ceramics LLC	Standard Grant	Ben Schrag	06/30/2011	$149,955.00		mchu@tamceramics.net	4511 Hyde Park Blvd	Niagara Falls	NY	143051215	7162789423	ENG	5371	1774, 1984, 5371, 9163, AMPP	$0.00	This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel and cost-effective processing and manufacturing route to produce high-temperature ceramic oxide thermoelectric materials comprised of nanosized (< 40 nm) grains.  Research has shown that a reduction in grain size below 100 nanometers in thermoelectric materials results in an increase in thermal resistance and overall thermoelectric performance by up to 40%.  The technical challenge involved is to maintain the correct powder composition and the sintered grain size below 40 nm throughout the required processing steps. The spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique limits grain growth to a minimum, such that grain size of the sintered ceramic remains below 100 nanometers, thus preserving all of the enhanced material properties. This project will evaluate the effects of processing parameters on physical properties of the thermoelectric powder, including particle size, surface area, impurity gain, green and sintered density, grain size and final microstructure.  The thermoelectric properties of the resulting powder will be evaluated, including Seebeck coefficient, dc conductivity, thermal conductivity, and ZT.  A commercially viable manufacturing process will be demonstrated for scale up to large quantities in the follow-on Phase II project. <br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the availability of thermoelectric nanomaterials operating at high temperatures (> 800 C), with enhanced thermoelectric properties.  As the conservation of energy resources and associated environmental concerns become more critical, societal interest in utilizing thermoelectric devices to generate electricity from waste heat has grown.  Thermoelectrics can function in many specialized applications, but have been hindered by a relatively low efficiency and high material costs.  Current materials also have production scalability concerns.  A new low-cost, high-temperature, high figure-of-merit thermoelectric material is necessary to satisfy commercial demands.  The materials to be developed in this project will enable increased market adoption by allowing waste energy harvesting at high temperatures with a relatively low expected low cost of production (under $3/watt).  Potential early adopters of these materials include the glass industry, steelmakers, and the automobile industry.  According to recent studies, there is almost $300 million worth of wasted energy per year in the glass industry alone.  The estimated market for these materials in vehicles is more than $1 billion.  This same material processing technology can be adapted for future applications in high ionic conductors for battery and fuel cell technologies, and other ceramic industrial materials.

Located on the western coast of McMurdo Sound it forms the largest relatively ice-free area on the continent yet is still subject to extreme environmental conditions: perennially ice-covered lakes, ephemeral streams, extensive areas of exposed soil, limited precipitation, and salt accumulation. All ecosystems are in some way shaped by climate and material transport yet nowhere is this more apparent than at MCM, where life approaches its environmental limits and subtle changes in climate have a major influence on the generation of liquid water. This in turn produces a cascade of processes influencing biological reproduction, productivity, biodiversity, and biogeochemistry. Research has shown that the Dry Valleys ecosystems are very sensitive to small variations in solar radiation and temperature so, while Antarctic ice sheets respond to climate change on the order of thousands of years, the glaciers, streams, and ice-covered lakes here respond almost immediately. <br/>The overall objectives of MCM are to understand 1) the influence of physical and biological constraints on the structure and function of Dry Valleys ecosystems and 2) the modifying effects of material transport on these ecosystems. The most recent stage of MCM research investigated the legacy of past climate change still strongly overprinting present ecological conditions. This new stage will explore the role of resource legacy and extant processes on determining contemporary biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Hypotheses will be tested through a combination of on-going monitoring and experimental programs plus new research within a vigorous modeling component designed to integrate and synthesize the data on a landscape scale. The new activities will enable biodiversity issues to be addressed in a more definitive manner, especially the interplay between physical dispersion and habitat suitability, and efforts will continue to focus on the integration of the biological processes in both aquatic and terrestrial components of the study site. Stoichiometric and molecular diversity components will be incorporated into the biogeochemistry research to provide a common currency integrating all ecosystem components through the documentation of landscape scale elemental transformations and genetic variation. The broader impacts include the training of graduate and undergraduate students, public education, and international cooperation. Outreach activities include the Schoolyard LTER program, Teachers Experiencing Antarctica, scientific presentations to dignitaries and other visitors to the field site, and the continued dissemination of results in scientific literature and through the lay media.

They often require that we extend our mathematical knowledge beyond the exact procedures that we have been taught. Many people have mastered the mathematical knowledge they have been taught in school, but they still display serious difficulties when challenged to extend that knowledge to new situations and often produce nonsensical answers. This research will study adolescents and college students who have mastered middle-school mathematics including fractions and negative numbers, and challenge them to extend this knowledge to deal with a novel mathematical concept.<br/><br/>This research will focus on a little-known class of mathematical problems, called pyramid problems or trapezoidal numbers, that have a natural geometrical interpretation to help guide their understanding. Their novelty to the general public makes them ideal for study and they require no calculations that go beyond middle school mathematics. Participants will be taught to solve pyramid problems that involve small positive integers and then they will be challenged to extend the relationships to deal with large numbers, fractional numbers, and negative numbers. To understand developmental trends, adolescents will be compared with college students. The data to be collected will involve a combination of performance measures, verbal protocols, and fMRI brain imaging patterns. Separate studies will investigate the basis of individual differences in successful knowledge extension, the effect of metacognitive engagement on success, and the role of the geometric interpretation in guiding inferences about the mathematical relationships. This research will take place within the theoretical framework of the ACT-R theory, a computational model of mathematical problem solving. The critical test of this theory will be its ability to predict the rich pattern of data collected. Having such a theoretical framework will be important for generalizing the results from pyramid problems to helping students extend their mathematical knowledge more generally. <br/><br/>The critical contribution of this research is that it goes beyond the question of how to teach a specific mathematical competence and addresses the question of how to prepare students to extend their mathematical knowledge and discover new mathematical relationships. Placed in the context of a formal computational model of cognition, it would make a major contribution to cognitive science and neuroscience by moving theory beyond the learning of well-defined procedures to the mechanisms responsible for the generation of new knowledge. This research will take place within the context of the Cognitive Tutors, which are currently deployed in many American classrooms, reaching over 500,000 students. The computational model developed in the project can be transitioned to these tutors and would enable a major enhancement in the kinds of competences that these tutors teach.

The existence of exact solutions to the equations governing such growth dynamics, their complete integrability, at least in the case of a flat metric, and the impressive amount of converging recent research on these topics make the project timely and unavoidable. As mathematical tools, the proposal will rely on and develop new facets of complex orthogonal polynomials, moment matrices and potential theoretic operators arising in the study of planar or spatial shapes. Particular emphasis will be put on the maximum entropy method for recovery of shade functions from indirect measurements, such as partial geometric tomographic data and the asymptotics of the spectra of random non-hermitian matrices.<br/><br/><br/>Following a decade of intense and vibrant discoveries in fluid mechanics and quantum physics, the present proposal addresses a series of mathematical questions of high interest for these specific areas of modern science. The tradition of encoding planar shapes and the geometry of volumes into numbers or algebraic symbols goes back to the XVII-century landmark contributions of Rene Descartes and his followers in what is today called ?analytic geometry?. Much later development and applications of electricity, magnetism and atomic science we all benefit today was possible by a second major step into the same direction, that is the representation of complex physical entities as large arrays of numbers or symbols called matrices. The proposed project focuses on the study of matrix models arising in the current research of moving interfaces of fluids or more sophisticated but similar media. Such moving boundaries phenomena are illustrated by cancer growth, crystal formation, ice melting, oil reserves, carbon monoxide sequestration and plasma dynamics. The PI is assisted by a group of enthusiastic doctoral students and he is connected, via several collaborative works, with experts in other fields of mathematics, physics or engineering.

Charles Ying	06/30/2014	$333,578.00		riteshag@seas.upenn.edu	Research Services	Philadelphia	PA	191046205	2158987293	MPS	1775	6863, 7237, 7969, 9161, 	$0.00	Abstract:<br/>Technical: The PI will study the electrical properties of phase-change nanowires (NW) self-assembled from Ge-Sb-Te alloys, which are important materials for their use in non-volatile random access memory devices. Chalcogenide materials (e.g., Ge-Sb-Te alloys) have been dominant in the field of nonvolatile optical and electrical storage applications because of their reversible crystalline-amorphous phase transition that is signified by large changes in the optical reflectivity and electrical resistivity. The realization of these advantages in memory device applications is, however, still limited with requirements for high scalability, low-power consumption and fundamental understanding of electrical transport, threshold switching and recrystallization mechanism from the amorphous phase. These challenges motivate the design and understanding of nanostructured materials with sub-lithographic features based on bottom-up approach. During the project they will develop NW-based experiments to systematically understand fundamental properties of size-dependent nanoscale electrical switching and phase transitions that are important in order to instruct the design of future memory devices. The evolution of the phase-change properties especially for amorphous phase nanostructured glass as a function of size has not been fully explored, mostly due to the lack of material systems that can be prepared in a controllable fashion with sufficient size control and without damaging the surfaces that occurs in top-down lithographic techniques. The study of NW phase-change materials will provide valuable information on the size-scaling of the phase-change mechanism down to sub-20 nm lengthscales that cannot be easily obtained from top-down patterned systems. The proposed research will be built upon the recent breakthroughs in the PI's laboratory in the area of phase change NWs, with demonstration of memory switching and remarkable size-dependent properties. The important questions that they will seek to obtain answers are: what is the conduction mechanism in the amorphous phase and its size and composition dependence; what is the mechanism of threshold switching and nucleation from amorphous to crystalline state; what role does stress or electronic relaxations play in temporal drift behavior of the amorphous phase. The PI will combine novel synthesis, structural characterization with detailed electrical measurements to answer these intriguing questions.<br/>To accomplish the objectives, the following approach will be undertaken:<br/>1) Synthesis of complex chalcogenide nanowires with precise control over their chemical composition and size. Capping of NWs with dielectric materials to prevent surface oxidation.<br/>2) Study the conduction mechanisms in amorphous state of phase change nanowire devices.<br/>3) Temporal drift behavior of phase change nanowires in the amorphous state<br/>4) Nucleation and threshold switching and their statistics in amorphous phase nanowires.<br/>Non-technical: Bottom up approach to self assembled nanostructures presents a unique way of creating highly efficient nanosystems that will have functionalities that are not possible with any conventional technology. The development of such a memory system will have tremendous impact on a variety of applications such as cheaper and highly efficient computer random access memory systems, and ubiquitous portable devices such as ipods and digital cameras. Research and educational activities will be integrated by the involvement of undergraduates in the research program, incorporating new research results in the teaching module, and training high school and college teachers from the Philadelphia district with student population from minority and underrepresented sections.

Understanding what factors cause these distribution limits is one of the main goals of ecology. In the simplest case, physical barriers limit the distribution of species. However, in most cases such barriers do not exist, and species gradually decline and eventually disappear along environmental gradients. In theory, distributional limits should emerge when the parameters responsible for an increase in population (birth and immigration) fall below those that reduce population size (death and emigration).  Since Darwin, naturalists have been working to understand how these population parameters are affected by environmental factors. Historically, the impact of biotic (e.g. competition, predation) and abiotic (e.g. temperature, humidity) factors on the population parameters have been treated separately. However, theoretical developments have shown that this is an oversimplification, and that multiple factors often interact to affect population growth and distribution. Nevertheless, empirical support for how biotic and abiotic factors interact to shape range boundaries is scarce. Arguably, this limitation is due to the difficulties of isolating and testing these factors using joint field and laboratory experiments. The research proposed here takes advantage of two closely related tropical fish species distributed across a complex gradient (i.e. salinity, predation, and parasitism) to test how biotic and abiotic factors interact to limit distributions. The Trinidadian Guppy (Poecilia reticulata) and the Swamp Guppy (Poecilia picta) inhabit rivers of Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidadian Guppies are freshwater occupants whose distribution ends at the brackish/freshwater interface. In contrast, Swamp Guppies are common in brackish water and crosses into freshwater, where their abundance gradually decreases toward their upstream distributional limit. Preliminary data suggest that salinity alone has a small effect in the two species. Furthermore, Trinidadian Guppies are competitively dominant to Swamp Guppies, but may be more sensitive to the direct and indirect effects of predators and parasites. Specifically, this project will compare how these two guppy species differ in 1) their swimming performance under predator attacks; 2) their tendency to avoid unfavorable salinity conditions; and 3) determine how competition, predation, and parasitism interact with salinity to determine distributional patterns using reciprocal field translocation experiments.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Six undergraduate students to date have been supervised by the Co-PI in the context of the dissertation research, resulting in: 1) the completion of a Honor Thesis; 2) two poster presentations at the Front Range Student Ecology Symposium; and 3) independent research experience. The proposed project will involve four new undergraduates, three from Colorado State University (CSU) and one from the University of West Indies (UWI), Trinidad and Tobago. Our previous contact with faculty and students from UWI emphasized the need for projects culminating in honors theses, and we will provide this opportunity through a side project. Using supplemental funds not requested here, the Trinidadian student will be brought to CSU for additional training, and all four students will have the opportunity to be involved in lab and fieldwork. This will expose them to experimental design in the field of evolutionary ecology. Additionally, CSU students will be presenting their results at the Front Range Student Ecology Symposium, national meetings, and to co-author peer-reviewed papers. This will provide a bridge to graduate school for both national and international students. Thus we consider this an exiting opportunity for international collaboration. Results of this research will be published in scientific peer reviewed journals, presented at international meetings and published as a PhD dissertation at Colorado State University.

Just as the Langlands program relates several areas of study (Galois representations, automorphic forms, and the representation theory of reductive groups over local and global fields), the p-adic Langlands program studies the relations between deformations of Galois representations, p-adic Hodge theory, the p-adic representation theory of reductive groups, and cohomology with p-adic coefficients. However, the p-adic program is only in an embryonic stage, and there is very little by way of general conjectures, let alone theorems. It is natural to consider the reduction mod p of the p-adic objects involved in the p-adic Langlands program, and when one does so one is led firstly to questions involving generalizations of the weight part of Serre's conjecture. The PI proposes to generalize this conjecture to arbitrary reductive groups, and to prove some special cases. The PI also proposes to prove the first cases of the Sato-Tate conjecture for modular forms of weight greater than 2.<br/><br/><br/>The Langlands program is a branch of mathematics that includes ideas from number theory (the study of equations in whole numbers), representation theory and analysis. The number theoretic part of the program consists of a vast set of interlinked conjectures relating the solutions of equations in whole numbers to other apparently unrelated mathematical objects. Recently, it has become clear that this part of the Langlands program should generalise to what is known as a p-adic Langlands program. This new program does not, as yet, have a precise conjectural formulation, and the PI proposes to investigate the correct formulations of the conjectures that should make up the program, to prove cases of them, and apply them to more classical problems in number theory.

More precisely, four of the main objectives of the program are: 1) further weaken the conditions and strengthen the results of current methods. The investigator aims to push the boundary of the field by developing new theoretical tools to analyze the current algorithms; 2) analyze the connections among different methods to get a deeper understanding of the nature of sparse signal recovery problem; 3) extend the research to multichannel setup which involves simultaneously recovery of a set of signals; 4) develop courses for both graduate student and undergraduate student. Build research projects for graduate students. Make the undergraduate students at least be aware of the possible limitation of classical methods and suitable alternatives.<br/><br/>Due to advances in science and technology, scientists and engineers are now able to collect and process enormously large data sets of all kinds. Such data sets pose many statistical challenges not encountered in smaller scale studies. One of the key problems in this area is the reconstructing of high-dimensional sparse signals, which is a fundamental problem in signal processing. This and other related problems have attracted much interest in a number of fields including applied mathematics, electrical engineering, statistics, finance, and bioinformatics. The proposed research will benefit applications in these scientific areas, for instance the compression of audio, images, and video signals and the analysis of microarray data. It is also of critical importance in linear regression, signal modeling, and machine learning.

Garrison	06/30/2012	$131,115.00		spennings@uh.edu	4800 Calhoun Boulevard	Houston	TX	772042015	7137435773	GEO	1195	0000, 5987, 7914, OTHR	$0.00	Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was an unexpected event that represents a major disturbance to coastal systems. Our understanding of how oil affects coastal wetland communities is incomplete. In particular, we know little about how oil affects the arthropod food web, about dose-response relationships between oil exposure and community response, and about long-term recovery from exposure. Moreover, the spatial extent, severity and persistence of this novel disturbance will provide new insights into how coastal wetlands function. Pennings' laboratory is well poised to examine how this novel disturbance will affect coastal wetland communities. His group has set up and sampled an experiment in 2009 at 22 coastal wetland sites ranging along the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida and the Atlantic Coast from Florida to Maine. This RAPID project will re-sample the same sites and plots in 2010 and future years to determine how the coastal food web is affected and recovers. The PIs will test the hypotheses that: a) oil exposure will reveal that herbivorous insects and snails have strong negative effects on salt marsh plants; b) oil exposure will reveal the importance of 'transient' members of the arthropod food web; c) oil exposure will interact with fertilizer and wrack treatments to affect the arthropod food web. Because of its spatial extent and persistent effects, the oil spill represents a novel disturbance to coastal wetlands. Evaluating community responses to this disturbance will provide new insights into how the food web functions, leading to a deeper understanding of this critical system.<br/><br/>Broader impacts:<br/><br/>Salt marshes provide a variety of critical ecosystem services to humanity. New scientific insights provided by this project will help predict the future condition of coastal wetlands, which are threatened by a combination of sea level rise, eutrophication, and other stressors such as oil spills, including this largest spill in U.S. history. Public interest in the health of coastal ecosystems is intense, and has already led to interviews of Pennings by journalists following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The results of this RAPID project will be of considerable media interest. In addition, the project will train two graduate students and one undergraduate in ecosystems science.

This GOALI will specifically transform the field by moving well beyond the near term goals to research and then apply key new technologies to the U.S.-based manufacture of optics that are not rotationally symmetric, including fully freeform surfaces. These types of surfaces have yet to be economically manufactured with precision for use with emerging Gigapixel detectors.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: There are a number of fronts available to advance science. First, there are the new surface definitions proposed by QED to provide a valid mathematical basis for developing manufacturing tolerances on the complex surface parameters. Second, there is the ongoing work at the University of Rochester to develop and disseminate the technology surrounding Nodal Aberration Theory that provides revolutionary insight into the fundamental theory of optical systems without symmetry. In addition, there is ongoing active research in finding novel, in-situ testing methods for these new surfaces.<br/><br/>Broader impact: The footprint of this program is substantial. It covers advancing simultaneously the industries that enable higher performance optical systems in support of other advancing technologies, for example high-definition video, remote sensing with Gigapixel sensors, and optical lithography for making computers faster and smaller. Expanding beyond the opportunity to influence the lives of graduate students, the program will also incorporate research experiences for undergraduates, aimed specifically at underrepresented minorities.

Before cooperative techniques can be<br/>implemented, two key questions need to be addressed: How do they perform<br/>in the context of a larger network, and how do they perform in actual<br/>experiments?<br/><br/>This project aims at providing answers to both these questions by<br/>combining theory and experimental work. On the theory side, the<br/>investigators use a rigorous analytic approach that combines tools from<br/>stochastic geometry and information theory. The stochastic geometry<br/>approach permits statements about ensembles of networks, rather than<br/>just a single fixed network geometry, which is often more tractable and<br/>leads to more general results. On the experimental side, performance<br/>measurements are taken on small cooperative networks of software<br/>radio devices. They are used to derive analytical models that can be<br/>used at higher layers in the protocol stack and to determine the overhead<br/>and control traffic required to set up the cooperation.<br/><br/>Based on the insight gained from both theory and experiments, novel<br/>cooperative protocols for wireless networks are derived.<br/>It is expected that the project will enable significant improvements in the<br/>performance of wireless systems, thereby helping to overcome the<br/>spectrum scarcity. The results are be disseminated in form of conference<br/>and journal articles, tutorials, and short courses, and some ideas will<br/>hopefully lead to patents.

Steuerwalt	08/31/2013	$142,715.00		mabeck@math.bu.edu	881 COMMONWEALTH AVE	BOSTON	MA	022151300	6173534365	MPS	1266		$0.00	When modeling physical or biological processes, one main goal is to use the model to predict the behaviors of the system that will be observed in the real world. Stable states of the system will attract all nearby configurations, and thus they can play an important role in determining the behavior. On the other hand, if the time-scale on which the system evolves toward that state is very long, one may never be able to wait long enough to see the stable behavior emerge. It is therefore important to also understand the transient behaviors that persist for long times. This proposal is concerned with developing mathematical techniques for both determining if a given state is stable and also for investigating such transient behaviors. In addition, certain bifurcations that capture when a state loses stability are analyzed. This is accomplished through the analysis of three main problems: determining the nonlinear stability of sources, a certain type of time-periodic pattern in reaction-diffusion equations; characterizing transient, yet persistent, dynamics in the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation; and analyzing the loss of stability of spatially periodic waves in a cardiac model and its connection with irregular heartbeats.<br/><br/>One primary goal of the mathematical modeling of physical and biological processes, in general, is to predict the way the system will behave in time. One way to do this is to look for so-called stable states. Stable states attract all nearby configurations, and thus provide great insight into the types of behaviors that will be observed. For example, when studying a model of cardiac dynamics, a periodic solution could correspond to regular heartbeats. If this solution is stable, then, even when subject to disruptions in its natural rhythm, the heart will relax back to regular beating. However, if a bifurcation occurs in which the periodic solution loses stability, this could correspond to a scenario in which arrhythmia, or irregular beating, will occur. Since this behavior is undesirable, one would like to determine, via mathematical modeling, how to adjust certain parameters in the system so that the periodic solution does not lose stability. This proposal concerns the development of mathematical techniques that allow one to determine if a given solution is stable, ways in which the solution could lose stability, and what types of transient behaviors one could observe as the system relaxes to a stable solution. The analysis is carried out in three main mathematical settings, each of which is related to applications in biology, such as the cardiac dynamics mentioned above, or physics, such as fluid dynamics.

The subject is developing rapidly, driven both by high-resolution and novel measurement techniques and remarkable recent theoretical developments. The conference consists of a broad swath of emerging ideas such as topological insulators, non-Abelian statistics and quantum computation, novel superconductors, and graphene amongst other topics. It is very likely that new technologies will emerge from these ideas and it is important that students and postdocs are well versed in these ideas to make important contributions to the society in the future. The conference will provide a unique opportunity for students and postdocs to further their careers by not only engaging in leading edge science, but also an opportunity for them to network with the leaders and their peers in the field. The guiding principle of a GRC is unique because of its emphasis in presentation of new, unpublished work and the free, unhampered discussion that follows, consistent with its off the record policy. Every effort is being made to involve a diverse group of participants and underrepresented minorities.

Recent years' CASP experiments have seen significant progress on protein 3D structure prediction. Medium to high-resolution structures can be predicted by the state-of-the-art methodologies through the combination of comparative modeling, threading and ab initio modeling techniques. The high-resolution models can be used for the analysis of biochemical function of the molecules in cells and for virtual ligand screening. The algorithms will be further improved by combining the I-TASSER structure assemble method with the meta-server threading techniques. As a complement to the full-length I-TASSER modeling, a locally installed meta-threading server (LOMETS) will be developed for the generation of multiple threading alignments and spatial restraints. The improvements will significantly increase the capacity of the service system to serve for the community, and help improve the quality of the core algorithms which the server systems are based on. The educational activities of the award involve development of four courses in structural bioinformatics as part of a bioinformatics program at KU. The project will also develop outreach materials in protein sequence-structure-function principles and participate in an annual multicultural roadshow designed to recruit underrepresented students to KU.
1022912	Doctoral Dissertation Research in Political Science: Reformed or Reconfigured? Explaining Why Militant Groups Participate in Elections	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	07/01/2010	06/23/2010	James Fearon	CA	Stanford University	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	06/30/2011	$11,998.00		jfearon@stanford.edu	3160 Porter Drive	Palo Alto	CA	943041212	6507232300	SBE	1371	9179, 	$0.00	Pundits and policymakers have recently debated whether a deal could and should bring the Taliban into Afghan politics as a party. The feasibility of a deal remains uncertain, however, as the militant group has so far shown few signs of engagement. Furthermore, even such a deal would not guarantee peace. Organizations such as the United Nations sometimes assume that holding elections after conflict, usually including the participation of former militant groups, facilitates a durable peace. Yet militant groups vary greatly in whether they run candidates in elections and otherwise behave like political parties during and after conflict, and, importantly, in whether they are willing to relinquish violence while participating.<br/><br/>We know very little about why militant groups participate in elections, and how this affects the subsequent likelihood of peace. The few case studies addressing these questions focus on a small number of large militant groups at the end of full-scale civil wars, and so they tend to assume that peace results from militant group participation rather than exploring its prospects in different contexts. Moreover, this work fails to generate comprehensive, causal theories exploring militant group motivations for participation that also account for their reactions to the expected behavior by other actors. In conflicts ranging from small terrorist campaigns to large civil wars, this project seeks to answer two related questions: why do some militant groups participate in elections while others do not? And, why do some subsequently continue to use violence while others do not?<br/><br/>The study employs a multi-method approach to understand militant group electoral participation, as well as the subsequent tactical use of violence. The researcher specifies a theory of militant group electoral participation based on her fieldwork on multiple militant groups in Colombia and Northern Ireland. The theory identifies both the group and the government as strategic actors whose incentives and actions jointly determine the outcome in terms of the militant group's participation, as well as in terms of post-election peace. Specifically, there must be a rough alignment between how the militant group expects to do competing in elections against the government versus fighting it militarily; the government's expectations must similarly align. Amid civil conflict, surprising events can shift these beliefs into such a configuration. The potential presence of an international actor, such as another government or a non-governmental organization, also influences both sides' decisions. The researcher located factors that change these expectations about competing through ballots or bullets in the case studies already conducted, but the states examined may differ for a variety of reasons. Thus, this project will test the theory more broadly. The researcher is building a global dataset of all militant groups, which features a measure of whether each participates in elections. With NSF support, the researcher will hire undergraduate assistants to finish coding this measure, and then collect a series of other variables permitting empirical tests of the hypotheses making up the project's theory. By examining these indicators across many cases, the researcher can assess the theory's validity in different contexts.<br/><br/>This project makes theoretical, pragmatic, and methodological contributions. First, social science research has not yet generated solid explanations for many of the political decisions made during civil conflicts, especially militant group electoral participation. This study analyzes such participation as an initial step toward engaging this neglected research area. Second, understanding the incentives of the actors in these situations and their impact on the outcome--in terms of electoral participation and peace--informs policy recommendations for the conflicted state, as well as other states and international organizations. Finally, this project provides an unprecedented, sourced, and transparently coded dataset of all militant groups that includes information on group and government actions, as well as measures of popular and international support. This research on all sizes of militant groups using any type of violent tactics also facilitates collaboration between the often separate civil war and terrorism research communities by providing a forum for testing theories of tactical decisions during fighting, and their impact on conflict termination.

In nature, tremendous variability is found in the geometries of cilia structures, as illustrated by the hair-like mechanoreceptor examples from fish, insects and mammals. Engineered cilia found in the literature exhibit cylindrical, curved and/or rectangular geometries. New fabrication methods that will not only improve control of these 2-D branching capabilities but will extend the ability to 3-D, allowing one to build in 3-D branching geometries in a wide variety of ferromagnetic materials. Fluid-structure interaction modeling will be used to predict optimal materials and geometries which will enable prototype hair-cell flow sensors and actuators to be fabricated. Nanowires geometries to date have been limited to planar structures and in our case cilia vertical to a planar substrate. The variety of shapes found in biological cilia suggests that optimization of nanowire geometries for use in flow sensors and actuators will require the ability to fabricate complex structures that are matched to targeted flow regimes. Therefore, novel templates will be used for 2D and 3D cilia geometries. For the microfluidic applications, tailoring of nanowire geometries requires understanding of low Reynolds number, laminar flows, i.e. regimes for which Navier-Stokes flow formulations for mean flows and Prandtl/Blasius solution formulations for the boundary layer are quite reasonable, and for which computational models of fluid-structure interaction compare well with measured flows. Computational modeling of 2D structures will be extended to the 3D structures grown in this investigation. <br/><br/>These cilia sensors and actuators will have impact well beyond the microfluidic applications that were proposed. Many micro- and nano-robotics would benefit from these nanosensors and arrays. Also, biological species themselves will be better understood with artificial sensing as their impact on the whole system can be evaluated without adverse affects to other functions as often occurs in biological studies. The PIs will organize a co-ed and girls-only summer camp in circuits and students from each school will be exposed to this interuniversity, interdisciplinary, industrially applied program.

The goal is to develop the conceptual tools, synthetic methodologies, and engineering strategies needed to design and chemically modify interfaces central to multi-component nanoscale devices. The research will concentrate on atomic and monolayer scale 'band alignment' as device geometries scale from planar to nanowire. The research will address key interface issues that must be understood when these materials are combined in nanoscale heterostructures. Studies will examine interfacial interactions of Ge with organic and inorganic layers in both nanowire and planar structures. The project will explore modification of the interfaces to: i) control oxidation, ii) passivate surface and interface defects, iii) tune band alignment (work function engineering), and iv) bond chemical species to interfaces for specific functionality. Expected outcomes include: A determination of the atomic and electronic structure of nanoscale interfaces; the establishment of an understanding of how chemistry and electronic structure differ between nanowire interfaces and their conventional planar analogues; and development of tools to control the electronic structure of interfaces and the resultant device properties by atomic and molecular modification/functionalization. High-resolution characterization tools that will be employed include surface, thin film, and nanoscale variants of: (i) photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopy, (ii) high resolution ion scattering, (iii) scanning probe microscopy, iv) electron microscopy (with energy loss spectroscopy), (v) optical spectroscopy, and (vi) electronic transport. Bilayer, multilayer and simple prototype devices will be examined. Results will be characterized in terms of current understanding of interface control, thus elucidating the important variables of size and dimensionality of the material constituents. <br/><br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. Research findings are expected to impact a range of technological applications including CMOS nanoelectronics, photovoltaics, organic electronics, and chemical/biochemical sensors. A solid fundamental understanding of interfacial materials chemistry and physics of ultrathin films and nanowires is expected. The materials being explored offer low-cost and/or higher performance alternatives to traditional devices. A strong set of educational activities include: (i) the development of new courses in energy materials with a focus on interfaces, (ii) the expansion of Rutgers student internships and industrial exchanges, (iii) the development of a new set of interactions between Rutgers and African institutions (facilitated in part by a new NSF-IGERT), and (iv) the development of nano and surface science oriented educational modules. The modules will target middle school students and teachers, coupling with the Liberty Science Center and the Rutgers Math-Science Learning Center. Outreach will also emphasize the mentoring of women and underrepresented minorities.

On the topological side, we study symplectic cohomology and its analogue for Lagrangian intersections (wrapped Floer cohomology). Recent advances of Bourgeois-Ekholm-Eliashberg and the author yield powerful computational tools, which we intend to exploit in order to study non-uniqueness questions for symplectic structures on open manifolds. On the mirror symmetry side, we consider decompositions of symplectic manifolds into pairs-of-pants, in the sense of Mikhalkin. One question under consideration is whether the Fukaya category can be reconstructed by gluing together pieces corresponding to each pair-of-pants. In general, this is not true and has to be modified by instanton contributions. However, there are cases where such contributions should be absent, and this would give a new viewpoint on Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture.<br/><br/>From a broader perspective, a crucial issue in many current investigations in physics and mathematics is the emergence of the classical notion of space from a quantum description. In the situation under study here, the main feature is that the construction of the classical space involves a series of gradual distortions, which can be determined by complicated but explicit formulae. This is a simplified mathematical model of a general class of physical theories, and not realistic as such. However, studying such models shows us where we are facing conceptual difficulties, which is important in order to develop our understanding further.

Itsweire	06/30/2012	$359,568.00		eriksen@u.washington.edu	4333 Brooklyn Ave NE	Seattle	WA	981950001	2065434043	GEO	1610	1324, 7916, EGCH	$0.00	This project is funded as an EArly-concept Grant For Exploratory Research (EAGER).<br/><br/>The Rapid Climate Change-Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heat Flux Array (RAPID-MOCHA) began monitoring meridional mass transports in the North Atlantic Ocean along a transatlantic section from North America to Africa in 2004. It estimates the climatically critical meridional overturning circulation (MOC) by differencing dynamic height profiles gathered from small clusters of moorings on either side of the Atlantic basin, measuring boundary current flows with current meters, measuring transport in the Florida Strait electrically, and using satellite winds to estimate Ekman transport. While bottom pressure gauges are used to estimate time-varying barotropic contributions, RAPID-MOCHA relies on an assumed spatially uniform temporally constant barotropic flow to estimate mean transport.<br/><br/>The first scientific use of the newly developed full-ocean-depth (surface to 6 km) autonomous underwater glider, Deepglider will complement the RAPID-MOCHA array. Deepgliders will be used to estimate absolute transports independently of RAPID-MOCHA by collecting repeat hydrographic sections of the extended western boundary region off Abaco, Bahamas. A pair of vehicles will repeatedly transit across 100 and 500 km wide overlapping sections between end members of the RAPID-MOCHA dynamic height moorings. These sections will be repeated about weekly and monthly, respectively, by Deepgliders, providing substantial spatial resolution compared to that provided by the moorings, although at considerably coarser temporal resolution. Each Deepglider is expected to last well over 1 year, possibly up to about 18 months. Integrated geostrophic shear inferred from horizontal density gradients resolved in the sections will be referenced to depth-averaged current inferred from each glider dive cycle. The difference between dead-reckoned glider displacement through the water and GPS displacement over the ground is used to estimate depth-averaged current. The Deepglider estimates will include the likely possibility of horizontally varying time-mean barotropic contributions to transport. The independent Deepglider estimates of transports will be compared to those from the RAPIDMOCHA array. <br/><br/>In addition, Deepgliders temporarily will be used in 'virtual mooring' mode to check the adequacy of the moorings in measuring dynamic height. Together, the complement of repeat section and moored time series will be used to assess errors and improve estimates of meridional transports in the extended western boundary region.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this work lies in its connections to basic issues of global climate dynamics. The variability of the MOC is not well observed, let alone understood. The same can be said for the deep flow. Comparison of techniques by which the MOC is monitored is essential to establish their credibility and effectiveness. Deepglider repeat hydrography will provide independent measures of climatically critical ocean circulation transports, the western boundary contributions to MOC. Resolution of the temporal/spatial structure of western boundary currents is prerequisite to understanding how this portion of the climate system operates.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This project will serve as a demonstration of efficacy and economy of full-depth gliders in monitoring ocean circulation not only along the RAPID-MOCHA line, but also along other transects. It will pioneer the use of autonomous gliders to monitor not only the upper ocean, but its deep regions as well. Currently Argo floats monitor the upper ocean globally, but the deep ocean is severely under-observed for climate change, a situation Deepgliders could alter. By making deep ocean access affordable, the Deepglider technology opens the possibility that the complete extent of global ocean climate change may be observed.

The underlying biological mechanisms of these novel approaches are not fully understood and several important questions including how to best schedule these therapies over time still need to be answered. The scheduling aspect becomes even more difficult and complex when several therapeutic agents are involved. For these combination therapies no medical guidelines are in place yet and mathematical modeling and analysis are able to give valuable insights into establishing robust and effective treatment protocols. Mathematical models for combination therapies are quite complex and, due to the various therapies pursued, are described by multi-input control systems. In this project, geometric methods from modern optimal control will be applied and developed as needed to analyze these systems when chemotherapy or radiotherapy are combined with anti-angiogenic treatments. Starting with simplified, but biologically validated models, increasingly more realistic medical features such as the pharmacokinetics of the agents and tumor immune system interactions will be incorporated. For these models unconventional mathematical structures arise that have not been analyzed in the context of biomedical applications before and are worthwhile to be investigated on their own merit. Our analysis employs tools that go well beyond the application of standard necessary conditions for optimality and aims at a full synthesis of optimal controls, i.e., a complete solution to the problem for arbitrary initial data. These solutions will set theoretical benchmarks to which other - simpler and practically realizable - protocols can be compared. The ultimate goal is to design robust and effective realizable protocols for combination therapies. Due to its applied and interdisciplinary character, the project contains a substantial educational component of interest to students from various fields including Mathematics, Biology and Engineering. Existing efforts to attract women and minorities to the project will be continued.

The focus is on Cerebral Palsy (CP), a disease that causes a variety of motor and other impairments. The most common symptoms of CP are a lack of muscle coordination, stiff muscles, exaggerated reflexes, and impaired gait, and treatment includes Physical Therapy (PT) and Occupational Therapy (OT), speech therapy, drugs, surgery, and orthotic devices. Initially, the PI will investigate game-based systems for the upper extremities. Traditionally, OT experts use subjective judgment in conjunction with the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) to measure the motor skills without connection to cortical level activity. The PI's approach is to connect cortical activity with motor activity. She will explore the coupling and integration of computer games and wearable sensors for both neurological and motor assessment testing, as well as for long-term rehabilitation at home. In particular, she will design a family of computer games that correspond to OT exercises and build an initial set of feature classifiers for types of CP with motor skill assessment. She will also build computer infrastructure for remote rehabilitation and a cyclical evaluation methodology. The primary outcome of this research will be an initial setup for remote rehabilitation that uses machine reinforcement learning and fuses multimodal information collected from a variety of sensors. Using computer games in conjunction with brain imaging and traditional rehabilitation outcomes is a radical and untested but potentially transformative approach to healthcare practices for chronic conditions such as CP.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The PI's long-term goal is to develop an intelligent system called CPLAY, whose front end is a set of computer games to provide controlled stimuli to children with CP in order to facilitate a desired motor response and generate performance data for diagnosis and rehabilitation treatment. CPLAY's backend will be a set of computational engines to enable data logging (from a child playing the game), data fusion, analysis and decision support. The @lab version of CPLAY will be used for functional near infrared (fNIR) imaging, while the @home version will be used for rehabilitation with various additional sensors capturing and fusing data during game playing. The fNIR imaging is used to determine neuro-plasticity and motor recovery. The @home version tracks performance over time, considers context of the game, and can be monitored remotely if needed. Both versions will allow for game adjustments to provide personalized treatment. The CPLAY approach promises to lower costs and facilitate family engagement in the rehabilitation. Project outcomes will include a paradigm, methodology and tools with broad applicability to other neurological disorders.

The monitoring of large civil infrastructure systems such as bridges, building, pipelines, etc. requires large sensing network and extensive sensor data processing. The biological systems are now known to employ highly sophisticate sensors and data processing to maintain their operation almost effortlessly and thus much can be learned from these systems to manage and monitor large civil structures. The focus of the workshop is to identify the high priority emerging research topics that can be pursued to develop bio-inspired monitoring systems for large scale civil infrastructure systems. It will also identify the collaborative research topics and mechanism that can be pursued by researchers to leverage the resources of different countries. The workshop will facilitate the exchange of ideas, research data, facilities, and resources among the international researchers to address the pressing research issues of common interest in structural health monitoring. The program includes a strong participation of young researchers and graduate students.
1024064	Doctoral Dissertation Research in Political Science: A Genome-Wide Association Study of Voter Turnout	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	07/01/2010	06/27/2010	James Fowler	CA	University of California-San Diego	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	06/30/2011	$12,000.00	Christopher Dawes	jhfowler@ucsd.edu	Office of Contract & Grant Admin	La Jolla	CA	920930621	8585344896	SBE	1371	9179	$0.00	The act of voting is a fundamentally important exercise in all democracies but explaining why individuals cooperate on a large scale when it is individually costly to do so has proven to be a challenging theoretical and empirical puzzle. The limited explanatory power of extant explanations of turnout has prompted political scientists to look at non-traditional predictors of turnout. The recent finding that more than half of the variation in voter turnout could be attributed to genetic factors (Fowler, Baker & Dawes 2008) holds the potential of profoundly changing the way one views voting behavior. However, the specific genes associated with voter turnout or the precise causal pathway linking genes to voting behavior remains unknown. This research project investigates hundreds of thousands of variants across the entire human genome to look for which ones are related to voter turnout. Identifying these variants provides a better understanding of how genes influence voter turnout and will ultimately help to develop and improve theories of political behavior.<br/><br/>The specific questions this research addresses are: 1) which specific genetic variants are associated with voter turnout; and 2) what is the causal pathway linking these genes to voting behavior?  In order to answer the first question, the investigator will perform a genome-wide association study of voter turnout. This specifically entails looking for significant associations between each of 592,652 distinct genetic variants spread across the human genome and validated as well as self-reported voter turnout. The analysis will be based on a sample of approximately 3,700 subjects. To answer to the second question, the data set also contains information on several individual attributes known to be highly predictive of turnout such as income, education, personality traits and cognitive ability. Therefore, the investigator formally tests whether specific genetic variants indirectly influence turnout via one of these attributes. Many genetic variants have been found to be associated with traits related to voter turnout giving us an idea of which pathways to investigate. For example, several genetic variants are known to be associated with personality traits and recent research in political science has shown personality traits influence turnout (Mondak, Hibbing, Canache, Seligson & Anderson 2010, Gerber, Huber, Raso & Ha 2008, Gerber, Huber, Doherty & Dowling 2009, Mondak & Halperin 2008). Researching the functional role of genetic variants found to be associated with turnout helps uncover causal pathways.<br/><br/>The discovered link between genes and politics presents the possibility of fundamentally changing how we view voting behavior. However, until one better understands the mechanism linking genes and voting behavior one cannot suggest what types of policies the government could put in place to promote higher turnout or the strategies political actors should adopt in order to mobilize their supporters. This research is necessary to move this nascent research into something useful for policy makers and political actors much in the way genome-wide association studies have aided researchers in better detecting, treating, and preventing diseases.

It will demonstrate a method to control the fuel electrode activity by external electrical means while converting a complex organic fuel, such as a simple carbohydrate, to produce electrical power output comparable to that of a hydrogen fuel cell.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to reduce reliance on fossil fuels since the fuel cell can theoretically run on any organic matter (tests will use sugar, fructose, and/or glucose). Also, use of organic matter to directly fuel the engine instead of using it to convert fuel into hydrogen will result in greater efficiency and less greenhouse gas emissions. The full commercialization of the research proposed could be far-reaching, allowing the conversion of benign fuels into electricity for a wide variety of uses.

The combination allows small, long-lived sensors that are as unobtrusive as a sticker to be placed on everyday objects and read when they are in the proximity of an RFID reader. The technology is an enabler for ubiquitous computing, cyber-physical systems, and sensor networks. This project is developing computational RFIDs as a networked system, with an emphasis on operating system software and hardware support on the computational RFID tags and network protocols that will support new applications. One key research challenge is that these devices are extremely energy limited and dependent on the varying energy they can harvest; the tags must schedule tasks well to use energy effectively. A second research challenge is to design network protocols that are well suited to computational RFID, since traditional RFID protocols are intended for repetitive inventorying tasks and sensor network protocols assume that nodes have symmetric abilities. The approach taken is experimental. The project is building software support and hardware extensions on an existing computational RFID tag, and prototyping candidate applications. The impacts of this research will be to extend the coverage with which computing systems can instrument the physical world, which in turn enables new applications, such as automated activity detection for eldercare, that are beneficial to society. The software and hardware developed as part of this project will be made available to other researchers and for educational use.

This research tests the hypothesis that the Pacific Marine ITCZ shifts to the south, and perhaps even below the equator, during glacial times. Using an innovative approach (measuring oxygen isotope ratios measured on planktonic foraminifera that calcify at the base of the photic zone) the researchers reconstruct changes in the position of the thermocline ridge that separates the North Equatorial Current from the North Equatorial Countercurrent. This ridge is currently situated just north of the modern ITCZ. The focus is on the last 150,000 years of Earth history. Funding supports education and training of a graduate student as well as involvement of undergraduates and high school students in research.

This study is motivated by 1) the need for multiplexed, low cost diagnostics for disease states in which appropriate capture ligands can vary broadly in structure and composition and 2) a need for general attachment methods that are insensitive to structural and compositional differences. Specifically, this project is aimed at diagnostics for drug, food and environmental allergies. We propose to explore the use of perfluorinated phenyl azide (PFPA) chemistry as a reactive and non-selective immobilization strategy for building these diverse arrays. This Phase 1 project aims to identify a single photochemical protocol for preparing arrays in which the immobilized materials retain biological activity. This method will enable the fabrication of highly multiplexed sensor arrays for use in point-of-care diagnostics.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to reduce the cost of allergy testing and enable physicians to make evidence-based decisions during a patient's initial office visit (<30 min). Current serological allergy diagnostics available in the market utilize a radioallergosorbent test (RAST) or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These tests can be multiplexed, but require a central laboratory reader, a one week turn-around time and a cost of $15-20 per allergen. The combination of quantitative electrochemical detection with rapid, multiplexed diagnosis of 100+ biomarkers in a single serum sample will provide a significant improvement to existing technologies. If successful, it would be transformative in the clinical diagnosis of allergy diseases, enabling rapid evaluation at the doctor's office in a format that is significantly preferable to laboratory tests, skin-prick testing or food challenges. In addition to the commercial potential of allergy diagnostics, the Phase 1 SBIR project will develop and disseminate a general method for preparing diverse arrays of biologically-active materials on a single support. This new technology would have application in many other fields that affect our health, such as diagnostics for infectious disease and cancer and devices for the detection of food and environmental contaminants.
1013497	SBIR Phase I: Overcoming the Recalcitrance of Cellulose	IIP	SMALL BUSINESS PHASE I	07/01/2010	12/09/2010	Rajai Atalla	WI	Cellulose Sciences International	Standard Grant	Anthony Walters	06/30/2011	$178,630.00		rhatalla@celscint.com	3591 Anderson Street	Madison	WI	537042542	6083109566	ENG	5371	1440, 5371, 9186, EGCH	$0.00	This SBIR Phase I project will test and develop the concept of enhancing the conversion of cellulose to glucose by providing the accessibility of the enzymes to the cellulose fibers at the nanoscale level. The project addresses a serious deficiency that currently exists in bio-fuels production from cellulose-based biomass. The goal is to increase the disaggregation of cellulose and starch so that it can be subsequently degraded using enzymes to a greater degree than presently possible. This pre-treatment process will allow enhanced conversion of starch and cellulose to simple sugars and allow for higher rates of anaerobic methane production.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will include creation of a pre-treatment approach leading to the ability to overcome a current limitation in the biodegradation and conversion of cellulose and starch (biomass) to bio-fuels. This could make bio-fuels more available in the longer term using a wider variety of residual biomass as feed stocks. It is likely that glucose from cellulose would become economically competitive with corn starch based glucose for production of bio-fuels, both ethanol and higher alcohols. This technology could produce cellulosic bio-fuels with an incubation time comparable to current starch-based production methods.

The diversity (number and identity) of coinfecting pathogens can modulate both pathogen transmission among hosts and pathogen impacts on hosts. Nonetheless, little is known about the processes that govern pathogen diversity. This research will integrate field experiments and mathematical models to study the causes and consequences of pathogen diversity. The study consists of a model system of five viral pathogens of grasses (the cereal and barley yellow dwarf viruses). This approach will allow the investigation of the interacting roles of the pathogen species themselves, the insect vectors that transmit them, their plant hosts, climate conditions, and spatial processes in controlling the dynamics of systems that include multiple pathogen species. Further, it will elucidate the mechanisms by which pathogens interact, and evaluate the consequences of these interactions for pathogen transmission and host fitness.   <br/><br/>This study will be of both scientific and societal significance. The work will advance the understanding multi-pathogen dynamics - a key step towards developing a comprehensive understanding of the ecology of infectious disease. It will include participation of under-represented groups, community outreach, and dissemination of results through both public talks and peer-reviewed journals. The investigators will integrate this research with education at both K-12 and university levels. The pathogens are among the most economically important viruses of crops, so this study may have benefits for agriculture. Moreover, these pathogens provide an experimentally tractable model for vector-transmitted generalist pathogens, the dominant type of emerging pathogen of humans, crops, and other species.

Pressure to select a good mate may be particularly strong when an animal will have only one mate in a lifetime, or survival of infants depends on both parents. This project focuses on the relationship between male testosterone (T), courtship behavior and fathering behavior in the California mouse, Peromyscus californicus. California mice are unusual for mammals because fathers help mothers raise offspring, who cannot survive without their father's presence. Work with fish and birds has shown that females of other species sometimes prefer mates who can signal that they will be good fathers, but it is unknown whether the same is true for mammals. This proposal expands upon previously collected data by the same researchers that show that the amount of T a male releases when he is introduced to a female predicts aspects of his potential as a good father. The goal of the proposed project is to determine whether females can detect the amount of T a male releases during courtship, and if females prefer males who release the most T and advertise this trait using vocal communication. These studies will further an understanding of how species form mating preferences, and strengthen the concept that paternal care can be an important resource for females to consider during mate choice. Moreover, exploring the relationship between T and paternal care in the California mouse will further a more general understanding of how the neuroendocrine system functions to support fathering behavior in mammals, which has the potential to extend to human parenting. Vocal recording techniques from this project will be used in a laboratory module for students enrolled in an undergraduate course in behavioral neuroscience.

This conference will bring together leading researchers in nanomagnetism to discuss the latest findings, interact with young scientists, and set future directions for exploration. Along with an electrical charge, electrons have a magnetic, quantum mechanical property know as spin. This conference provides a forum to discuss spin-dependent and magnetic phenomena in systems at the nanoscale. Spintronics, a potential new technology that will use an electron?s spin instead of its charge, continues to be a prominent area, but the study of magnetic nanostructures encompasses a wide variety of topics. Along with traditional topics such as magnetic tunnel junctions, spin-polarized materials, and patterned nanomagnets, which continue to be topics of great interest, the 2010 conference will include sessions in emerging areas: spintronics in semiconductors and graphene, magnetically drive gene delivery, magnetoelectric memory, and spin batteries. The coupling between magnetism and heat is a completely new theme for this meeting. This is a unique conference because of the extended discussions and ample opportunities for interaction between leaders in the field and young scientists.
1001381	Study of the Evolution of Nanoparticle Crystallization and Optical Properties in Glass Ceramics	DMR	OFFICE OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY AC, CERAMICS	07/01/2010	05/13/2013	Jacqueline Johnson	TN	University of Tennessee Space Institute	Standard Grant	Z.

The glass ceramics have potential applications as an x-ray imaging plate, for example in a digital mammography system. A further goal of the research is to provide insights into ways in which the material could be optimized for this application. Europium-doped fluorozirconate glasses, additionally doped with chlorine, can be heat-treated in such a way that it forms a novel nanocomposite material containing barium chloride nanocrystals, with the ability to convert ionizing radiation (usually x-rays) into stable electronhole pairs. These can be read out afterwards with a scanning laser beam in a so-called photostimulated luminescence (PSL) process. Optical studies have shown that the nanocomposite glasses gives out five times more light than the equivalent volume of the single crystal. The reason for this increased light output is not understood but the answer lies in the interface between the nanoparticles and its host glass matrix, as a result of the formation of the barium chloride nanoparticles. The ideal technique to analyze the structure and composition across nanoscale interfaces is by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ex situ TEM analysis has previously been carried out on samples that were annealed at various temperatures but this only provides a snapshot of the available science. The planned TEM studies include high resolution imaging of the atomic-scale structure of the nanocrystals and their interfaces with the glass matrix, in conjunction with energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) composition mapping of the chemical distribution in and around the nanocrystals. Further, samples, which have previously been heat-treated in a furnace or irradiated by a laser with different energies and pulse length, in order to induce nanocrystal nucleation, will be examined and the three nucleation techniques, ex situ thermal, laser, and in situ thermal will be compared.<br/><br/>The University of Tennessee Space Institute regularly runs summer science camps for K-12 and employs summer interns. The entire UTSI staff participates in the outreach efforts. Dr. Johnson has developed a detailed seven week summer research experience program for a combination of high-school and undergraduate students. The students receive a glass-ceramic sample and go through a program of characterization, oral presentation, report preparation, career day and mock grant writing workshop. The program culminates in the preparation of a journal article. The PI regularly acts as a mentor for the Introduce a Girl to Engineering day, which is a program at Argonne for Middle School female students.

Loss of Hippo signaling leads to tissue overgrowth and aberrant organ size in animals like fruit flies and mice. Previous studies have identified several key components in this pathway. A central question in this field is how Hippo signaling is activated by upstream components to control tissue growth and organ size. Also, it is not clear how cellular growth is regulated by Hippo signaling. This project will address these questions with molecular and genetic approaches investigating the role of upstream molecules, Expanded, Merlin and Sav, in Hippo membrane localization and activation. Itwill also test a hypothesis that Hippo signaling negatively regulates cellular growth by blocking insulin receptor signaling activities. Hippo membrane localization is expected to be a key step for its activation. Studies on Hippo signaling shall advance our knowledge of how tissue growth and organ size are controlled in animal development. Moreover, this research project provides great opportunities to promote teaching, training, and learning for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/>During summers, high school students from an outreach program will come to Dr. Lai's laboratory to gain research experience in developmental biology and genetics. To disseminate research results, the Lai laboratory will publish its work in a timely fashion, regularly attend conferences and give talks in local schools and other institutions to enhance scientific understanding by the community and society.
1001322	Mappings of real submanifolds in complex space, CR geometry, and analytic PDE	DMS	ANALYSIS PROGRAM	07/01/2010	06/16/2015	Peter Ebenfelt	CA	University of California-San Diego	Continuing grant	Bruce P. Palka	06/30/2016	$191,913.00		pebenfelt@ucsd.edu	Office of Contract & Grant Admin	La Jolla	CA	920930621	8585344896	MPS	1281		$0.00	The goal of this project is to study geometric and analytic aspects of generic real submanifolds in complex manifolds (or, more generally, of manifolds with a CR-structure). Particular attention will be paid to the structure of mappings between such manifolds. Examples of generic manifolds include (smooth) boundaries of open subsets of complex Euclidian space. Important information about proper mappings between open sets can be gleaned from their restrictions to the boundary. Basic questions that will be investigated include the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of CR-mappings between given CR-manifolds, as well as geometric questions that arise in connection with this study. The objective is to gain a deeper understanding of mappings in CR-geometry, and their role in complex analysis and PDE. One part of the project will focus on these problems in the context of nontrivial CR-mappings of a Levi-nondegenerate hypersurface into another of higher dimension. The principal investigator expects that this research will lead to a better grasp of how the local CR-geometry of such hypersurfaces (which, in principle, is completely encoded in the Chern-Moser CR-curvature tensor) affects geometric properties of CR-mappings (e.g., various notions of nondegeneracy and rigidity). The principal investigator will also study geometric and analytic properties of CR-mappings between more general CR-manifolds. A particular analytic property of interest is that of finite jet determination. The equidimensional case is by now fairly well understood. The principal investigator intends to study the situation where the target manifold has a higher dimension than that of the source. This situation appears to be drastically different from the equidimensional one. The principal investigator anticipates that this study will involve the development of substantially new methods, which in turn will enhance our understanding of mappings into higher dimensional spaces.<br/><br/>The study of real submanifolds in complex manifolds is central to complex analysis and to other areas of mathematics and physics. In this research, tools from a wide range of areas such as real and complex analysis, partial differential equations, and algebraic geometry are used and further developed. The principal investigator is hopeful that the investigations carried out in this project will enhance our understanding of the geometry of real submanifolds and partial differential equations in complex space, which will benefit research in adjacent areas of mathematics as well as in areas of theoretical physics. He expects the project to provide interesting research topics for graduate students. The seminar activity that results from the project should prove stimulating for both students and other researchers.
1023167	Rags to Riches: An Archaeological Study of Textiles and Gender in Iceland, AD 874 -1800.	PLR	ARCTIC RESRCH SUPPRT & LOGISTI, ARCTIC SOCIAL SCIENCES	07/01/2010	05/30/2012	Michele Smith	RI	Brown University	Continuing grant	Anna Kerttula de Echave	06/30/2014	$487,049.00		Michele_Smith@brown.edu	BOX 1929	Providence	RI	029129002	4018632777	GEO	5205, 5221	1079, 5221, 9150	$0.00	This project will conduct a three-year study exploring gender, textiles and society in Iceland from the Viking Age (ca. 874-1050) until the early 19th century, using museum collections from 12 archaeological sites from across Iceland.<br/><br/>Until ca. 1750, textiles and their production were central to the operation of the Icelandic economy. While raising, herding, and shearing sheep were tasks primarily undertaken by men, the transformation of sheared wool to yarn, cloth, and finished products was women's work. It is not inappropriate to suggest that the products of their labor formed the basis on which this society ran. Woolen textiles were legal currency in medieval and post-medieval Iceland, against which all other commodities were valued and traded. Debts, taxes, tithes and foreign exchanges were paid in woolen cloth. Detailed laws regulated the quality and construction of different types of woolen cloth for use in different types of exchange or for exchange at different rates, but it was women working together who ensured that quality, regulated their own household?s production, and created its durable wealth.<br/><br/>Women were also in charge of transforming cloth into clothing and, through that process, produced the most essential items of daily life - clothing, blankets, tents, and other utilitarian items - that buffered Icelanders against a changing climate and often-severe conditions during the Little Ice Age. In the process, they also established styles used to demonstrate households' status vis-‡-vis others; to visually affirm individuals' status by marking gender, age and marital status; and to link Icelanders to international styles and to emerging emblems of regional and national identity.<br/><br/>Through a detailed analysis of textile collections now held in Icelandic museums, recovered over the past century from archaeological sites in all parts of this subarctic island and spanning 1100 years, this project will document and analyze women's roles and women's involvement in textile production, In so doing, it will help to establish an archaeology of gender in the North Altantic. <br/><br/>By exploring textile production and use, through time, on an island-wide scale, it will document the roles of imported textiles and dyes within Iceland and the ways that women's work in textile production influenced both Iceland?s domestic and international commerce. Through this approach, it will shed new light on women?s power within Icelandic households at different levels of the social system, providing a valuable contribution to social archaeological research in the North Atlantic. <br/><br/>Finally, by exploring the decisions that women made in transforming textiles - both domestic and imported - into clothing, this project will investigate the roles they played in establishing and changing markers of individual, family, regional, and national identity as well as decisions they may have made when facing increasing global climate cooling in the North Atlantic. <br/><br/>This project will bring Icelandic women and women's work to the forefront in North Atlantic research, use them as a model for reintroducing women into archaeological research programs across the North, and contribute to global discussions about the hidden roles of women in traditional societies and their roles in guiding change and preserving tradition.
1008058	Nonlinear Problems of Solid Mechanics	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	07/01/2010	05/29/2012	Stuart Antman	MD	University of Maryland College Park	Continuing grant	Eugene Gartland	06/30/2014	$383,000.00		ssa@math.umd.edu	3112 LEE BLDG 7809 Regents Drive	COLLEGE PARK	MD	207425141	3014056269	MPS	1266		$0.00	Antman<br/>DMS-1008058<br/><br/> The investigator gives careful mathematical treatments of a<br/>variety of dynamical and steady-state nonlinear problems for<br/>deformable rods, shells, and three-dimensional solid bodies,<br/>possibly in contact with moving fluids, variable temperature<br/>fields, and electromagnetic fields. The bodies are composed of<br/>nonlinearly elastic, plastic, viscoplastic, or<br/>magneto-(visco-)elastic materials. In each case, properly<br/>invariant, geometrically exact theories encompassing general<br/>nonlinear constitutive equations are used. The goals of these<br/>studies are to discover new nonlinear effects and new kinds of<br/>instabilities, determine thresholds in constitutive equations<br/>separating qualitatively different responses, determine general<br/>classes of constitutive equations that are both physically and<br/>mathematically natural, determine how existence, regularity, and<br/>well-posedness depend on material behavior, contribute to the<br/>theory of shocks and dissipative mechanisms in solids, and<br/>develop new methods of nonlinear analysis and of effective<br/>computation for problems of solid mechanics. <br/><br/> For treating the behavior of both new technological<br/>materials and old biological materials, such as living tissue,<br/>traditional theories, based on such simplifying assumptions as<br/>small deformations and linear response, may well fail to capture<br/>important physical phenomena and may, in fact, give misleading<br/>information. E.g., the study of a specific problem for a<br/>traditional theory may indicate that a dangerous instability<br/>occurs in a solid body when an externally applied load or<br/>frequency exceeds a certain threshold. An analysis of the same<br/>problem without the simplifying assumptions may well show that a<br/>large class of materials give rise to instabilities at thresholds<br/>much lower than those predicted by simplified theories. Since<br/>correctly formulated exact nonlinear problems of solid mechanics<br/>seldom can be directly subsumed under available mathematical<br/>theories for treating the governing equations, one purpose of<br/>this project is to develop new mathematical techniques to handle<br/>such problems. These techniques can treat whole ranges of<br/>materials at one time. The results have consequences for<br/>structures under loads (bridges, buildings, biological<br/>structures), for control of smart structures, and for<br/>micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMs).
1042835	RAPID:Collaborative Research: Excavation of an Underwater Cavern Containing Primates, Other Extinct Vertebrates and Archaeological Remains in Hispaniola--A Site Under Threat	BCS	ARCHAEOLOGY, Biological Anthropology	07/01/2010	06/18/2010	Geoffrey Conrad	IN	Indiana University	Standard Grant	Carolyn Ehardt	06/30/2012	$19,878.00	Charles Beeker, Kevin Hunt	conrad@indiana.edu	509 E 3RD ST	Bloomington	IN	474013654	8128550516	SBE	1391, 1392	7914	$0.00	A multidisciplinary survey of the Padre Nuestro cavern, southeastern Dominican Republic is the goal of this research. The cavern is underwater, but its floor was dry at the time of emplacement of extinct vertebrates and archaeological materials. Primates, rodents and sloths originated in South America and had arrived in the Antilles by the early Miocene, but absence of other typical Miocene South American taxa like carnivorous marsupials, armadillos, and notoungulates suggests that a connection between the continent and the islands were intermittent and subject to biotic or cross-water filters. Padre Nuestro contains thousands of loose bones on its floor that so far include many species of native cavioid rodents and several kinds of ground sloths. A skull of an Antillean primate has already been recovered and conserved. A particular emphasis will be the reassessment of the phylogenetic patterns of the primates and sloths using the new material because this contributes important information to the debate over the biogeographic origins of the Antillean fauna: did vertebrates arrive by a filter or via long-distance over-water sweepstakes dispersal and were there a single or multiple dispersal events? In addition, the cavern contains archaeological material that will improve knowledge of the timing and causes of extinction of sloths and primates in Hispaniola, in particular whether extinction was caused by climate change or was induced by the arrival of humans. If the archaeological remains can be shown to be autochthonous and undisturbed since the time of cave flooding, they represent an unusual insight about the culture of some of the earliest immigrants to the Antilles. <br/><br/>The improved phylogenetic analyses made possible by the recovery of more complete remains of primates and sloths will allow tests of hypotheses regarding how and when these mammals entered the Greater Antilles. Geochemical analyses will provide the first direct evidence about the local environmental conditions under which these vertebrates lived. The research also contributes significantly to the Museo del Hombre Dominican and assists in training of staff in the conservation of bone preserved under these circumstances. The research is part of the effort to strengthen the fragile status of archaeological and paleontological remains and provide further support for stronger protection measures of this and similar sites.
1002817	Planning Grant for a National Center for Nuclear Energy Education and Training (NCNEET)	DUE	ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG	06/01/2010	06/02/2011	Kevin Cooper	FL	Indian River State College	Standard Grant	Duncan E. McBride	09/30/2011	$69,964.00	Jose Farinos, Kevin Cooper	kcooper@irsc.edu	3209 Virginia Avenue	Fort Pierce	FL	349815541	7724624703	EHR	7412	1032, 9178, SMET	$0.00	The increased interest in nuclear energy combined with a nuclear workforce that is close to retirement has created a timely and critical need to educate a 21st century nuclear energy workforce at all employment levels. Specifically, over the next two decades a need is projected for more than 41,000 trained technicians in the nuclear industry. Current educational programs are not scaled to meet the forecast need. <br/>The purpose of this planning project is to develop the infrastructure for a National Center for Nuclear Energy Education and Training (NCNEET). The goal of the NCNEET is to make sure the demand for skilled nuclear technicians is met in a unified, systematic way. The main goals of the planning project are: <br/>1. Identify and enlist faculty and representatives from businesses, the nuclear energy industry, nuclear agencies, and organizations to provide intellectual leadership for the center's various activities. <br/>2. Study the specific technician needs of the nuclear power industry in the different regions of the country and establish educational strategies, priorities and timelines. <br/>3. Build a coalition of colleges with established nuclear technician education facilities, infrastructure, and faculties. <br/>4. Identify the specific discipline of focus for each partner college and their needs in the effort to scale up to become a center for education. <br/>5. Develop a comprehensive plan showing an understanding of the workforce needs and the ability and readiness of NCNEET to meet these needs. <br/><br/>INTELLECTUAL MERIT <br/>NCNEET is directed by Indian River State College in conjunction with Miami Dade College, Linn State Technical College, and Salem Community College. These institutions have been involved in nuclear technician education for almost 30 years and have been recognized nationally for their excellent programs. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACT <br/>By building a network of dynamic educational programs capable of scaling up to meet the energy industry's workforce needs, the NCNEET reduces the risk associated with serious shortages of technicians. In addition, the existence of the NCNEET can accelerate the implementation of new nuclear facilities. The project encourages participation by members of groups under-represented in the nuclear industry, especially women and members of ethnic minorities.
1013345	SBIR Phase I: Mesoporous Graphene Electrodes for Supercapacitors	IIP	SMALL BUSINESS PHASE I	07/01/2010	12/09/2010	Yongchao Si	NC	Allotropica Technologies	Standard Grant	Anthony Walters	06/30/2011	$168,750.00		ysi@email.unc.edu	413 Deming Road	Chapel Hill	NC	275141000	9192650800	ENG	5371	1238, 5371, 9150, 9163, AMPP	$0.00	This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop high capacitance, low resistance graphene electrodes for supercapacitors to achieve high power and energy densities. One of the major technical barriers to high performance supercapacitors is low specific capacitance of the currently used activated carbon electrodes. This barrier is primarily due to poor access to the activated carbon surface area by an electrolyte: a substantial fraction of the surface area is in the form of micropores (< 2nm diameter) and consequently inaccessible to ion migration and therefore, unable to contribute to energy storage. This difficulty can be ameliorated by replacing microporous activated carbon with graphene, a one-atom-thick, conductive allotrope of carbon with a rare combination of extremely high specific surface area, remarkable thermal/electrical conductivity, an open microstructure, and good thermal stability. The small business, in collaboration with the University of North Carolina, will exploit the newly discovered route to graphene to produce mechanically stable, flexible, mesoporous electrodes for supercapacitors, electrodes that will achieve higher energy storage capacity and enhanced performance.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project lies in the many applications that can be enabled by supercapacitors. It is expected that the demand for supercapacitors in consumer electronics will increase from $122 million in 2008 to over $550 million in 2014. And, in large storage applications such as wind turbines and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the market value of supercapacitors is expected to expand from $86 million last year, to over $320 million in five years. In the critical technologies of HEVs, supercapacitors will enable improved gas mileage via two primary functions: leveling the dynamic power loads, and recovering available energy from regenerative breaking. The U.S. government has a strong interest in advancing HEVs to lessen dependence on foreign oil and address the global climate challenge. In the private sector, leading automotive companies are developing HEVs as an alternative to internal combustion engine-powered vehicles. Graphene-based supercapacitors offer the potential for attaining the requisite high energy/power density for high pulse power in HEV application.
1033071	Understanding rapid pseudo-solid state step-growth polymerization in micro-layers leading to ultra-high molecular weight polymers with unusual molecular structures	CBET	Proc Sys, Reac Eng & Mol Therm	07/01/2010	06/29/2012	Kyu Yong Choi	MD	University of Maryland College Park	Continuing grant	Maria Burka	09/30/2013	$334,120.00		choi@umd.edu	3112 LEE BLDG 7809 Regents Drive	COLLEGE PARK	MD	207425141	3014056269	ENG	1403	047E	$0.00	1033071<br/>Choi<br/><br/>This research will investigate the pseudo-solid state step-growth polymerization in the confined reaction space of an amorphous polymer micro-layer where high to ultra-high molecular weight (MW) polymers are rapidly produced. Pseudo-solid state polymerization (p-SSP) has the ability to produce ultra-high MW polymers in short reaction times. The extraordinary high MWs and the exceptional properties of the final polymer can only be compared with condensation polymers produced via ring opening polymerization, but p-SSP is more economically feasible and environmentally friendly.<br/><br/>This polymerization technique consists of formulating a low MW amorphous polymer precursor with catalyst into a confined reaction space of a polymer micro-layer, and carrying out the polymerization at reduced pressures and at temperatures close to but below the polymer melting point. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the reaction proceeds more than 20 times faster than conventional solid state polymerizations in semi-crystalline particles, and polymer MWs and polydispersities notably exceed the theoretical limits of the classical step-growth polymerization theory. At moderate reaction times, insoluble/infusible structures coexist with soluble structures, and the final polymer exhibits excellent optical clarity. The presence of branched structures has been confirmed by 13C-NMR and 1H-NMR, and the rheological characterization of the polymer. The relatively high mobility of polymer chains in the amorphous state, the efficient removal of polycondensation byproduct from the micron-sized reaction space, the radical-induced branching reactions via thermal decomposition of the residual casting solvent or via scission reactions, Fries rearrangement, interchange reactions, and high reactivities are hypothesized to be mainly responsible for the fast and unusual increase of the polymer MWs and the formation of insoluble polymer. Three model systems have been investigated: bisphenol-A polycarbonate, poly(L-lactic acid), and a copolymer of polycarbonate and poly(dimethylsiloxane). It is expected that the technique can be applied to many other condensation systems, suggesting that p-SSP can have a broad impact on step-growth polymerization technology. Through experimental and theoretical studies, this project will develop fundamental understandings of the chemical and physical phenomena that govern the p-SSPs process.<br/><br/>The Intellectual Merit: The goal is to develop new quantitative understandings of the chemical and physical phenomena that drive the kinetics of p-SSP to unusual reaction behaviors through experimentation and theoretical modeling. P-SSP is different from melt and conventional solid-state polymerizations, and its kinetics deviates from the traditional approaches. Integration of comprehensive experimentation and mathematical modeling will provide a systematic way to produce tailor-made condensation polymers for a variety of special applications where high or ultra-high MWs, solvent resistance, and thermal resistance are required.<br/><br/>The Broader Impacts of the Proposed Study: P-SSP is a method to produce ultra-high MW condensation polymers in short reaction times. This research will provide fundamental data and knowledge for the development of an advanced polymerization process technology, especially for large-scale mass production, as well as new polymer properties. For instance, the synthesis of insoluble and infusible structures for traditionally soluble polymers can inspire a variety of novel applications. The research results are expected to be applicable to many other condensation polymerizations. The results of the research will be presented at relevant scientific and engineering fields. Undergraduate students at all levels, regardless of ethnic background and gender, will be strongly encouraged to participate in the proposed project as semester research or summer internship programs. Academically talented high school students will also be invited to a summer research experience program through University of Maryland's Women In Engineering (WIE) program. The participating students at different levels will be encouraged to develop innovative applications and test the ideas as the research progresses.

The fuel source uses low value renewable feedstock and a mixed culture of bacteria to supply the reactants.  The oxygen content in the fuel makes it competitive with ethanol.  The project will outline the quantitative analysis of combustion properties using a dynamometer and exhaust emission analysis.  In addition, the impact this chemical has on the environment will be analyzed. The data will be used to estimate its persistence and fate in the environment.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to use low value materials from a wastewater treatment plant and agricultural bio-solids as a potential source of chemical feedstocks.  This in turn, decreases solid waste from a wastewater treatment plant and agricultural operations.

Magnetic and transport properties of a unique rare earth chalcogenide compound system, Ln3-xVACxQ4, employing several low temperature, high magnetic field, and high-pressure experiments will be investigated. In Ln3-xVACxQ4, Ln represents a trivalent rare earth, VAC represents a cation vacancy with a concentration range from x=0 to x=1/3, and Q represents a divalent chalcogenide anion, normally S or Se. For x=1/3 there is one vacancy per nine Ln atoms. All Ln3-xVACxQ4 compositions in this study have the generic cubic Th3P4 structure. By merely varying the vacancy concentration and/or the rare earth species in Ln3-xVACxQ4, it is thus possible to obtain a remarkably broad array of magnetic and electrical properties: from semiconducting to superconducting and from diamagnetic to ferromagnetic. In the pseudobinary continuum of compositional space between these extremes lie dilute magnetic semiconductors, magnetically doped superconductors, metallic spin glasses, possible quantum critical points, and very likely some highly correlated electron systems. Ln2YbCuQ5 was recently discovered, and in addition to adopting a novel structure type, these compounds display magnetic properties that range from simple Curie-Weiss paramagnetism to short-range antiferromagnetic coupling to long-range ordering in Sm2YbCuS5. In this latter phase negative susceptibility and substantial diamagnetism is observed in low-temperature magnetism experiments, perhaps indicating the presence of a superconducting component. Large single crystals are needed for a variety of studies to better understand the magnetic behavior of this unusual compound that will include neutron scattering/diffraction experiments, magnetic anisotropy, and resistivity measurements.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The preparation and characterization of new magnetic materials that utilize the abundant and readily available lanthanide elements is important in the development of novel technologies. This research program is aimed at training the next generation of materials scientists and solid state chemists to deeply probe materials synthesis and characterization, and to discover how novel properties can be used to solve technological problems. Specific classes continue to be developed to provide a fundamental education in this area of research, as well as to determine how best to capitalize on the knowledge of the unusual behavior of lanthanide elements. There is a strong focus in this program on training underrepresented groups, particularly African-Americans, and a strong track-record in recruiting and retaining these individuals has been established and will be significantly enhanced by the support from the National Science Foundation, Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program.

Main St, Suite 710	Durham	NC	277054010	9196843030	MPS	1267, 1264		$0.00	This project is applying knowledge of the topology of moduli spaces of curves to problems in arithmetic and algebraic geometry. The three main foci of the project are to:<br/>(1) understand universal elliptic motives. These are motives (mixed Hodge structures, Galois representations, etc) associated to all elliptic curves. Elliptic motives are helping to explain, for example, why classical modular forms impose relations on special values of multiple zeta functions. They are also helping the PI to understand relations between extensions of Galois representations associated with elliptic curves and modular forms.<br/>(2) understand rational points of smooth projective curves over finitely generated infinite fields. This builds on earlier work of the principal investigator. He and his collaborators are extending it to fields of positive characteristic.<br/>(3) use knowledge of fundamental groups of certain moduli spaces (such as mapping class groups) to investigate fundamental questions in algebraic geometry. One such question being studied by the PI is whether every smooth projective curve is dominated by a smooth plane curve.<br/><br/><br/>Topology is the study of the shape of topological spaces. The set of solutions of a set of algebraic equations forms a topological space.<br/>Its shape often exerts a lot of control over the set of solutions of the equations, especially when the solutions are required to be whole numbers, or ratios of whole numbers (known as rational numbers). The PI, with his collaborators and students, is using his knowledge of the shapes of some very special (and complicated) spaces, called moduli spaces, to help understand rational and integer solutions to some very general systems of algebraic equations. Algebraic curves and their rational points have long been studied by mathematicians. Their study, although esoteric, now plays an important role in modern cryptography.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Algebra and Number Theory Program.

Renewable energy is a national priority and the most viable alternative to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, reduce hazards caused by humans to the environment, and improve the US economy. Despite a close alignment within the National Science Education Standards, renewable energy concepts are generally not taught in schools because teachers have limited knowledge of the concepts, and more importantly, do not have access to the educational technologies to teach these concepts. During this project a multi-disciplinary team of renewable energy experts, educators, computer graphic animators and programmers will identify key renewable energy concepts and outline steps involved in production and utilization of renewable energy to produce the D-REL. These interactive renewable energy process simulations will use a computer-based graphic interface, and subsequently, using 'backwards design' with feedback from teachers, interactive, educational video games will be developed. <br/><br/>The worldwide computer based learning industry is presently valued at $49 billion. This industry is expected to grow exponentially as the price of computers continues to drop, and as a result our technology will become more important. The renewable energy industry will maintain growth with investment greater than $200 billion over the next five years. As renewable energy production grows, the industry must be supported via science education and our D-REL technology will be in demand. Our target market is the student population of 55 million. To the best of our knowledge, no technology similar to ours exists, reducing competition. Our technology teaches politically, socially and economically on one of the most important topics.

Makaroff at Miami University (Ohio) for three summers, commencing in 2010. The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program. The research projects focus on collaborative research in interdisciplinary areas of chemistry and biology. Sample projects include: (1) the recently-discovered system that transports fully-folded proteins into the thylakoid lumen; (2) the development of polymeric columns for separations of chemical species; (3) the synthesis of biologically-active natural products; (4) the elucidation of the fate of tannin under in vivo conditions; (5) the synthesis and study of reconfigurable surfaces, responsive to light and/or chemical stimuli; (6) the study of heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria; (7) the study of the structure and dynamics of integral membrane proteins with NMR methods; (8) the study of proteins involved in chromosome condensation and sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis and mitosis; (9) the design and development of tools to effectively measure student learning . Besides being exposed to cutting-edge research at a research-active institution, the students participating in this program will participate in site visits, professional development activities, and ethical training. Students targeted for the recruitment to the proposed site will come from schools without significant opportunities for research as well as schools with large populations of students underrepresented in chemistry.<br/><br/>Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide practical, hands-on research training to a significant number of students who might not have this opportunity at their home institution. The interdisciplinary projects that the students will work on while at Miami University (Ohio) are excellent examples of the kinds of cross-disciplinary work that is becoming more and more typical of the most fruitful avenues for modern laboratory research. Students participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.

The<br/>one-day workshop has been especially beneficial for junior graduate students, giving them a supportive<br/>environment in which to present their research (in many cases, for the first time) and enabling them to<br/>meet peers and more senior researchers in the field of machine learning. The networking opportunities<br/>provided by the workshop have also helped senior graduate students find jobs following graduation.<br/>Intellectual Merit: This workshop will advance machine learning knowledge and foster collaboration<br/>within the machine learning community. As invited speakers, established researchers at top universities<br/>and research labs will teach workshop participants about cutting-edge ideas from diverse areas of<br/>machine learning. Students will present their own research and receive valuable feedback from both<br/>senior researchers and their peers. By enabling women at all stages of their careers in machine learning to<br/>exchange research ideas and form new relationships, we expect that new connections and research<br/>collaborations will be established, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art of the field.<br/>Broader Impact: This workshop will provide a forum for female graduate students, postdoctoral fellows,<br/>junior and senior faculty, and industry and government research scientists to exchange research ideas and<br/>establish networking and mentoring relationships. Undergraduates, particularly those who are interested<br/>in pursuing graduate school or industry positions in machine learning, are also welcome to attend.<br/>Bringing together women from different stages of their careers gives established researchers the<br/>opportunity to act as mentors, and enables junior women to find female role models working in the field<br/>of machine learning. The workshop will also benefit the wider machine learning community: Firstly, the<br/>WiML website, which lists all previous workshop presenters, serves as a useful resource for organizations<br/>looking for female invited speakers. Secondly, co-locating with a major machine learning conference<br/>enhances the visibility of female researchers among the wider machine learning community. Thirdly,<br/>travel funding provided to workshop participants also facilitates their travel to the co-located conference,<br/>which for some participants would otherwise not be possible. Finally, all workshop materials (slides,<br/>abstracts, etc.) will be made available on the workshop website in order to ensure broad dissemination.

While satellite remote sensing, aircraft flights, and surfaces drifters are providing valuable information on the oil surface trajectories since the accident, little is known about how the spill is distributed below the surface. In this project, the investigator hereby will implement an advection, diffusion and reaction tracer model for Emulsified Oil created by the use of dispersants and couple it within our exiting South Atlantic Bight and Gulf of Mexico (SABGOM) circulation nowcast/forecast system to track the vertical and horizontal distribution of the oil plumes. This coupled oil-circulation model will be run throughout the entire hurricane season (June 1 ? November 30) to provide 24/7 prediction of three-dimensional oil trajectory in the GOM and southeast Atlantic coastal ocean. <br/><br/>Specific questions to be addressed in this project include:<br/>1) How is the spill distributed at depths, and to what extent they have been transported by the<br/>Sub-surface currents?<br/>2) How does the strong mixing associated with tropical storms traversing the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic Bight bring subsurface oil up to the surface? <br/>3) How do the storm surges transport the newly surfaced oil up on the beach?<br/><br/>Given there is still no consensus on the total amount of oil spilled from the wellhead, the investigator will also perform model sensitivity experiments with various amount estimates of oil spill. Existing satellite and aircraft observations will be used to validate the simulated oil spill surface features, including expansion directions and total areas. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The resulting three-dimensional oil tracer fields (from different oil spill amount scenarios) will be used to calculate the oil residence time at different depths of the ocean, thereby offering critical information for continued restoration effort. As a part of deliverable of this project, the predictions of circulation and three-dimensional oil trajectories will be made available through a public website. Research findings will be published in peer reviewed journals.

(i) Critical regularity in Eulerian dynamics: we will use spectral dynamics to investigate a new framework for vanishing viscosity solutions of the pressure-less Euler equations, for global regularity of the Euler-Poisson equations subject to sub-critical initial data, and the long-time regularity of the shallow-water driven by irrotational forcing. (ii) Entropy stability and well-balanced shallow-water schemes: we will develop, analyze and implement a new class of well-balanced schemes for the shallow-water equations. (iii) Self-organized dynamics: we will study the long-time behavior of models driven by velocity-alignment and address two interrelated issues. When does flocking occur with local interactions, depending on the connectivity of the underlying graph, and how is it realized in hydrodynamic models of flocking? We will also explore new models of self-organized dynamics in which inter-particle communication is scaled by their relative distance. (iv) Regularizing effects in quasi-linear transport-diffusion equations: we will continue our ongoing research on regularizing effects using velocity averaging in the concrete setups of nonlinear scalar conservation laws and certain systems which admit an entropic kinetic formulation. (v) Integro-differential equations for multi-scale decomposition of images: we will study the localization properties of new multi-scale integro-differential equations for image de-noising and de-blurring. <br/><br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this project is to construct, analyze and simulate time-dependent problems which are governed by nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and develop related novel computational schemes. The underlying equations involve nonlinear transport models, self-organized dynamics, and possibly different small scale decompositions into particle dynamics, kinetic distributions, or intensity of pixels; they arise in diverse applications, including fluid dynamics, collective behavioral sciences, and image processing and de-noising. We will focus on the unifying mathematical content of the equations, using a synergy of modern analytical tools and novel computational algorithms, to study the persistence of global features in these equations. The project provides a great educational experience through research for the graduate students and postdoctoral fellows involved.

The reductionist approaches that focused on individual bacterial populations provided a wealth of valuable information, usually under simplified conditions, but to truly understand how complex microbial communities function, the interactions and interdependencies between different populations inhabiting the same environment must be explored. <br/>The premise of this proposal is that many bacteria engage in unknown interactions with neighboring organisms, and that these interspecies links can be characterized using microbiological and genome-enabled approaches. Dehalococcoides and free-living, pleomorphic spirochetes (FLiPS) are members of natural river sediment and aquifer microbial communities. Dehalococcoides are highly specialized bacteria that gain energy for growth by removing halogen substituents from many hydrocarbons, including priority pollutants. This process is called organohalide respiration, and as the bacteria breathe halogenated hydrocarbons (just like we breathe air), the contaminants are detoxified. Dehalococcoides bacteria grow very poorly in isolation but perform robustly in mixed cultures when FLiPS are present. Conversely, FLiPS benefit from Dehalococcoides, and a major goal of the project is to explore the biomolecular basis of these microbe-microbe interactions. This project will characterize unexplored microbe-microbe interactions (symbiosis) at the fundamental, molecular level and shed light on the evolutionary mechanisms that lead to beneficial interactions between distinctly different microbial populations. <br/>This research project will generate new understanding on how microbe-microbe interactions develop, operate, and persist, while affecting specific functions of the community (e.g., detoxification of halogenated hydrocarbons). This project will not only advance knowledge of Dehalococcoides and spirochete biology, but will further improve our predictive ability how microbial communities function and respond to perturbations. Two doctoral students and three summer undergraduate students from the University of Puerto Rico will engage in this research effort.

The objective of this project is to understand and control dopant incorporation rates and junction profiles in silicon and germanium nanowires in order to establish a foundation for nanowire device fabrication. Atom probe tomography is used to map the 3-dimensional distribution of donor and acceptor dopant atoms in vapor-liquid-solid and vapor-solid-solid grown nanowires with single dopant atom sensitivity. Varied catalysts and growth conditions will be employed to understand the thermodynamic and kinetic factors that influence doping rates. Such understanding is expected to establish the ultimate limits of junction abruptness for both radial junctions, as in core-shell structures, and axial junctions. Electrical transport and scanning probe measurements, including scanning Kelvin probe microscopy and scanning photocurrent microscopy, are used to determine the fraction of active dopants and measure the electrical profiles of dopant homojunctions. The integrated activities of synthesis, composition mapping, and electrical characterization permit distinctions between electrical properties that arise from nanoscale dopant distributions and those that arise from modified screening on the nano/meso scale. <br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The activity is expected to advance materials and metrology of critical importance to the semiconductor industry. The project integrates research and education by advancing discovery and understanding through involvement of the PI and his graduate students in a new Student Investigative Research program at a local high school and engaging student groups from a senior level process design course in the discovery and optimization of nanowire processing-structure relationships.

Such signaling may be used to advertise specific qualities of the signaler and may impact the reproductive success of the individual. Though much research has focused on this relationship, the causal links between the signal and an animal's fitness (i.e., survival and reproduction) are unclear. This project will address this gap by studying a signal that advertises a functional trait. Functional traits are the combined output of different systems in an individual and can be the targets of selection. The goal of this research is to determine how signals and functional traits interact to determine fitness. Green anole lizards are well-suited to explore these relationships. The size of the extendable throat-fan, or dewlap, is related to the ability of a male to bite hard. Males that bite hard tend to win aggressive encounters with males that bite with less force. Experimental manipulations of dewlap size, combined with behavioral observations and genetic tests of reproductive success, will be used to determine how a signal and its correlated function influence male reproductive success. This area is relatively unexplored and has implications for theoretical work on animal signaling and sexual selection. Anole lizards are well-known by many and serve as model organisms for studies of behavior, ecology and evolution. Hence, they are ideal organisms to teach students of biology about animal communication and sexual selection. This study will involve undergraduates and outreach to the general public.

The oil is dispersing northward in the Gulf of Mexico, very likely heading toward the Florida and Alabama beaches, with almost a certain landfall along the some parts of the Gulf coast region. Both the small- and large-scale regional effects of the oil?s interaction with the dynamic sandy beach environment are unknown. The proposed study will investigate and quantify beach-oil interaction through intensive field data collection immediately before and after the ?landfall? of the oil. The proposed study will be accomplished through a series of intensive field data collection, focusing primarily on the sedimentological aspect. It is anticipated that regional distribution of the oil landfall will be mapped by various government environmental agencies. However, the processes associated with vertical mixing of the oil into the beach sediment may not be well documented. The Coastal Research Laboratory in the Department of Geology at the University of South Florida (USF-CRL) is well positioned to provide the crucial information on the oil-beach interaction, in addition to the effects at a regional scale.

The project is establishing career pathways to technical work in the renewable energy fields. The specific needs for a renewable energy certificate are being identified, and space in the planned Community Technology Center is to be devoted to the laboratory areas needed for the program. The A.A.S. degree in industrial technology is meeting the needs of students and incumbent workers by providing a clear career pathway from an industry-related certificate to an A.A.S. degree and then to a baccalaureate degree. The new A.A.S. degree is meeting the needs of industry by encouraging students and incumbent workers who earn a technical certificate to pursue the additional education/training that offers the most benefits to the worker and the employer. That additional education focuses on areas often referred to as soft skills, for example, communication, teamwork and critical thinking. The need for soft skills in the industry workplace is widely recognized and has been documented in a number of reports.

From behavioral analysis, neuroscientists can gain insights into brain function such as learning, memory, decision-making and other cognitive activities. Yet, the neural mechanisms by which behavior is produced and regulated remain poorly understood. Dr. Zhang and his associate propose to develop a new molecular genetic method to non-invasively dissect the neural circuitry underlying behavior in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. They will be developing and refining a genetic method that allows for restrictive expression of genes in subsets of neurons in the fly brain. They will then examine the behavioral consequence following the perturbation of these neurons or a neural circuit. This brain-behavior mapping effort is expected to significantly advance the understanding of brain function. Another important aspect of this proposal is to develop new genetic tools. Dr. Zhang has begun and will continue to make these reagents freely available to the fly community. These reagents will be deposited in a public domain (such as the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center). The strategy developed in the proposed work is also expected to be applicable to other genetic model organisms. This proposal has strong outreach and broader impacts. Building upon the past record of excellence, Dr. Zhang will actively participate in education, training, and outreach to local communities. This includes mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, training a postdoctoral fellow, involving a local high school science teacher in summer research, and participation of science outreach activities in local schools and museums.
1014354	SBIR Phase I: Catalyst Energy Recovery Utilizing a SuperTurbocharger	IIP	SMALL BUSINESS PHASE I	07/01/2010	12/09/2010	Ed VanDyne	CO	VanDyne SuperTurbo Inc.

The innovation is a unique design that integrates turbocharging, turbocompounding, and supercharging into one compact device that uses an infinitely variable speed transmission.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be a reduction in fuel consumption in two ways. First is direct heat and energy recuperation from the exhaust stream. Second is to enable downsizing of internal combustion engines as a means to increase fuel economy. Turbocharging can be used for that purpose but adds driveability issues (turbo-lag). The proposed innovation could solve this problem.

In nature, tremendous variability is found in the geometries of cilia structures, as illustrated by the hair-like mechanoreceptor examples from fish, insects and mammals. Engineered cilia found in the literature exhibit cylindrical, curved and/or rectangular geometries. New fabrication methods that will not only improve control of these 2-D branching capabilities but will extend the ability to 3-D, allowing one to build in 3-D branching geometries in a wide variety of ferromagnetic materials. Fluid-structure interaction modeling will be used to predict optimal materials and geometries which will enable prototype hair-cell flow sensors and actuators to be fabricated. Nanowires geometries to date have been limited to planar structures and in our case cilia vertical to a planar substrate. The variety of shapes found in biological cilia suggests that optimization of nanowire geometries for use in flow sensors and actuators will require the ability to fabricate complex structures that are matched to targeted flow regimes. Therefore, novel templates will be used for 2D and 3D cilia geometries. For the microfluidic applications, tailoring of nanowire geometries requires understanding of low Reynolds number, laminar flows, i.e. regimes for which Navier-Stokes flow formulations for mean flows and Prandtl/Blasius solution formulations for the boundary layer are quite reasonable, and for which computational models of fluid-structure interaction compare well with measured flows. Computational modeling of 2D structures will be extended to the 3D structures grown in this investigation. <br/><br/>These cilia sensors and actuators will have impact well beyond the microfluidic applications that were proposed. Many micro- and nano-robotics would benefit from these nanosensors and arrays. Also, biological species themselves will be better understood with artificial sensing as their impact on the whole system can be evaluated without adverse affects to other functions as often occurs in biological studies. The PIs will organize a co-ed and girls-only summer camp in circuits and students from each school will be exposed to this interuniversity, interdisciplinary, industrially applied program.

Ecologists are faced with the critical challenge of anticipating potential ecosystem responses to these changes. This proposed dissertation research will use kettlehole basins in northern Wisconsin as model systems to study the effects of past hydroclimatic variability on ecosystem structure and function. The research is designed to test the hypothesis that peatland establishment and expansion in these systems is a threshold response to climate variability, in contrast to prevailing models that suggest limited climate sensitivity. Methods will include detailed paleoecological analyses of lake and peatland sediment cores from multiple kettlehole ecosystems. Paleoecological data will be integrated with information on basin morphology and landscape position to develop a model of kettlehole ecosystem dynamics under various global climate change scenarios. <br/>The proposed project will increase our understanding of the potential for ecosystem state-shifts in response to future climate changes. Results will help resource managers anticipate potential changes in kettlehole ecosystems in the coming century, as well as changes in the ecosystem services provided by these unique systems. In addition, the predictive model developed as part of this study will be coded in open-source software and equipped with an intuitive graphical user-interface, enabling access by resource managers, educations, and students.

This project will combine protein structural modeling with these data to significantly enhance their value, and to develop a deeper understanding of these data. The aim is to test the data and discover missing interactions, to develop molecular models of most pairs of interactions, and in this way to learn about the compatibilities of the pairs of interactions. The molecular modeling will rely on available protein structures, comparative modeling for those not available in the PDB and docking of the individual protein pairs using software presently provided by others. Physical overlaps in binding sites will be used to determine whether interaction sites overlap and are thus incompatible or whether they can coexist in assemblages of multiple proteins. Clustering the proteins for related functions is important to limit the number of combinations of interactions to be considered and will compensate for some uncertainties in the modeling. The overall objective is to fully investigate all pairs of interactions and their interdependences. Validation of some newly predicted interactions will be carried out by mass spectrometry. Higher order assemblages will be constructed that are consistent with the structural models of the binding sites, leading to structural assemblages for specific functions, on the same pathway. These analyses are important for investigating the details of functional clusters of proteins. In this project, all of the individual clusters will be investigated for their functional relationships, for their molecular structures, and as an important way to annotate the protein-protein interaction networks. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The protein-protein interaction annotation server will permit large numbers of users to access the whole body of information that will be generated during the project. Research-based graduate student training will be provided, and the student's educational experiences will be enhanced by this project. Native American, Hispanic and African-American students particularly will be sought for engagement in this project through collaborations at other Universities, having large populations of these students. All students for recruitment to this project will be targeted from these sources, enhancing the continuing search for more diverse future scientists from multiple programs and multiple institutions.

In particular, it examines how British penal regimes were transformed as they were transferred to the colonial Gold Coast both as the colonial government adopted and altered those systems to meet its own unique needs and as native rulers transformed the British penal system to align it with indigenous beliefs and practices that predated colonial rule. It is hypothesized that these colonial transformations were subsequently transferred back to Europe and further influenced penal developments there. The question raised by these transfers is whether the form the penal systems took was determined by the culture of the colonizing power, by the indigenous peoples it encountered in its implementation, or by other factors such as changes that were being wrought in the colonial economy. Data analysis methods include discourse, statistical, and legal analysis along with archival ethnography to determine which ideas and penal structures were circulating throughout the British Empire and how they were transformed by the ideas and structures already in place in the Gold Coast.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary study will contribute to the sociology of punishment, which often seeks to explain penal systems by pointing to the effects of social structure, material or power relations, viewed in isolation from the underlying culture. Rather than focusing on a single factor in isolation, this project will examine the role of culture in relation to other processes in shaping penal systems. The research will also broaden the field of the sociology of punishment, which has been primarily focused on Europe and the United States, by studying an underrepresented region and country while also focusing on processes of institutional transfer that have shaped the histories of penal systems throughout the world.

While hypervalent iodine compounds are well-established reagents, little progress has been made in the development of new catalytic reactions promoted by hypervalent iodine. Studies of new, extremely mild and efficient iodine(V)/transition metal tandem catalytic system for the oxidation of hydrocarbons will be investigated using various aryliodides and transition metals as co-catalysts and Oxone as a stoichiometric oxidant. Several other iodoarene-catalyzed oxidative transformations, such as Hofmann rearrangement of amides to amines, preparation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds from ketones, oxidative cleavage of carbon-carbon double bonds, and the iodine(III)-catalyzed enantioselective oxidations will also be studied. An exploratory search for new and potentially useful hypervalent organic compounds will be also performed. In addition, an important objective of this project is to provide excellent training in advanced chemistry research to BS and MS students and to further strengthen predominantly undergraduate research at University of Minnesota Duluth.<br/><br/>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Viktor V. Zhdankin of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of Minnesota Duluth. Professor Zhdankin's research efforts revolve around the development of facile oxidative methods based on hypervalent iodine chemistry. Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as it utilizes non-toxic compounds of iodine as catalysts or recyclable reagents in aqueous solutions. Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical industry.

Carbon molecular sieves are porous materials that possess small selective pores distributed in two to three relatively narrow size ranges that can provide the resulting membranes with high selectivity for olefin/paraffin analog separations. This project will develop a novel process to make new rigid carbon-ceramic structures that are chemically and thermally stable, and thereby, resistant to plasticization induced by absorption of hydrocarbons. This project is expected to lead to the development of carbon membranes with sufficient olefin permeance and olefin/paraffin selectivity to yield an efficient process to recover olefins that are currently flared in polyolefin plant vent gases. Moreover, this research is expected to increase the understanding of carbon-ceramic membranes and their potential for use in an array of chemically and thermally challenging gas separations that are not possible with conventional polymeric membranes. <br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the large economic potential associated with the successful commercial use of the new carbon membranes in molecular separations, considering the commercial value of the recovered olefins, and the large volumes of olefins and polyolefins consumed annually in the United States. If these inherently stable new carbon membranes are successfully developed, they could be used as an energy-efficient separation method in variety of large industrial applications including olefin/paraffin separations for monomer production at steam crackers and recovery of olefins from fluid catalytic cracker off-gases in refineries. With the appropriate membrane materials, membrane-based separations offer the advantage of substantially reduced energy consumption compared to other separation methods including absorption and distillation.

Studies have shown that many bugs are cloned (i.e., copied-and-pasted) to many places. Unfortunately, existing error detection tools have not provided programmers the ability to efficiently search for bug clones. Thus, they have to resort to ad hoc manual approaches such as grepping the source tree for bug clones.<br/><br/>This project aims to improve software reliability and integrity through automatic detection and repair of bug clones given a newly discovered vulnerability. It will investigate a new dimension, code similarity, for detecting software bugs. Specifically, it will investigate the feasibility of an approach that derives bug seeds from a new bug patch or existing static or dynamic error detection tools, searches a large code base (potentially across administrative domains) for bug clones, and automatically protects the bug clones. This approach can detect bugs in cases where many existing techniques cannot due to code complexity: detecting similarity between code is easier than deconstructing its meaning.<br/><br/>If successful, this project will result in accurate tools that will help to detect and repair software vulnerabilities early. Programmers will use these tools to detect and repair bug clones whenever applicable. Improvements in the reliability and security of software on which business, government, and individuals depend on will positively impact society. This project will provide a more reliable and robust computing infrastructure resilient to new threats and attacks. Integrating the proposed research into the CS curriculum will as promote reliability and security awareness.

Large Amazonian rivers are known to act as barriers that separate genetically distinct populations of related birds (species pairs or different subspecies). Rivers, however, cease to act as barriers in their headwaters, where many pairs of otherwise divided populations of birds come into contact. The aim of this study is to explore both the role of rivers as barriers to gene flow (phylogeographic breaks) and the rivers' headwaters as meeting points (contact zones) using 90 pairs of species or subspecies of birds. This research will pioneer a comparative multi-species approach to study bird distributions and species interactions in remote regions of the Amazon, focusing on plumage characters and molecular data. This study will address long-standing questions in evolutionary biology, including the role of physical and ecological barriers in the geographic location of contact zones, the role of rivers as historical and contemporary barriers to bird species (the Riverine Barrier hypothesis), and the relationship between genetic distinctness and the likelihood that two populations will interbreed when in contact.<br/><br/>This project relies on close cooperation between American, Brazilian, and Venezuelan institutions. Fieldwork in Amazonia included Brazilian students and assistants, who were introduced to museum-based studies of biodiversity. This project is likely to lead to long-term collaborations with South American scientists. Understanding how physical barriers prevent gene flow will help understand the consequences of large-scale human-created fragmentation on natural populations.

1013097	SBIR Phase I: Novel Microstrain Enhanced Catalyst Supports for Hydrogen Production	IIP	SMALL BUSINESS PHASE I	07/01/2010	06/02/2010	Michelene Hall	NY	Excelerant Ceramics LLC	Standard Grant	Anthony Walters	01/31/2011	$150,000.00		michelene.hall@excelerantceramics.com	200 North Main Street	Alfred	NY	148021000	5857461334	ENG	5371	1401, 5371, 9163, AMPP	$0.00	This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is a feasibility study to validate a novel process for forming innovative catalysts applicable to steam methane reforming. The factors that dictate heterogeneous catalytic activity are still not thoroughly understood. It is commonly believed that a material must have a high surface area to be catalytically active; yet, not all materials with high surface areas are catalytically active. Similarly, it is not surprising that porosity is also considered to be a desirable property for developing highly active catalysts. These microstructural features also do not constitute a highly reliable predictor of catalytic activity. Building on previous academic studies that identified a method to engineer structural defects in ceramic oxides that have demonstrated catalytic activity, the small business will induce structural defects in new materials and compositions to achieve new catalysts of higher activity and stability. The insights to be learned from synthesis, characterization and testing studies are expected to enhance the understanding and application of this new phenomenon in heterogeneous catalysis.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project is the opportunity to create significant energy and cost savings in hydrogen production. Hydrogen gas is a major feedstock for a number of industrial processes, including ammonia production and oil refining. The current production processes of hydrogen gas are very energy intensive. The novel approach pursued by the small business may be used to form catalysts for the steam methane reforming (SMR) process, one of the principal methods for converting natural gas into hydrogen. One of the energy intensive aspects of SMR is the generation of steam, also called process steam. If successful, the new catalyst is projected to reduce the quantity of process steam needed for SMR, increase the plant capacity and reduce tube wall temperatures which will result in lower maintenance and operating costs. The reduction in process steam is expected to lower energy consumption, leading to an average annual savings of more than $1,000,000 per hydrogen production plant. These energy savings will have a direct impact on hydrogen producers and an indirect effect on consumers of derivative products such as agricultural fertilizers used by farmers.

High resolution, georeferenced, digital elevation models (DEMs) processed from raw ALSM data (point clouds of laser postings in xyz space) are critical for observing a multitude of geomorphic features at scales appropriate to the fundamental processes that govern their topographic expression. Examples include, fault structures, hill slopes, river channels, coastal features, glaciers, volcanic edifices and vegetative canopy structure. DEMs developed from ALSM can be used to model and therefore better understand the dynamics of these landforms and the underlying processes that form them. The technique also has obvious applications in civil engineering. <br/><br/>This grant provides five years of continued support for the management and operation of the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM). A collaborative effort between the University of Florida (UF) and the University of California - Berkeley (UC-B), NCALM provides project planning services, ALSM flight and ground crew operations, technical support for data analysis, and access to computational resources and software to make available to the broader geosciences community, high accuracy, high spatial resolution digital topographic data. NCALM makes available to the science community, an Optech GEMINI 167 kHz and 33 kHz ALSM systems owned by UF that can be flown on a UF twin engine Cessna 337 aircraft equipped with GPS equipment and an inertial measurement system. These systems can also be flown on leased aircraft for international projects or projects that dictate high altitude flights. NCALM staff are also involved in: 1) development of new laser ranging technologies including MHz photon counting ALSM operating at wavelengths that allow for water penetration for coastal bathymetry; 2) developing methods and software for multi-sensor data collection and fusion; 3) training students in ALSM techniques and applications through the UF graduate program in Geosensing Engineering; 4) administering a competitive seed grant program for student investigators; and 5) community outreach through ALSM workshops and organization of ALSM science sessions at national meetings. NCALM is managed by PIs at UF and UC-B and is advised by a steering committee (SC). The SC provides guidance and review on the following: 1) scheduling and prioritizing projects; 2) cost effective management of the Center; 3) information dissemination; 4) opportunities and necessities for technological upgrades; and 5) contact and coordination with major programs (EarthScope, CUASHI, Margins, etc.) and agencies (NASA, FEMA, USGS). <br/><br/>***

The innovation lies in using a bed material of zeolite-activated carbon to adsorb carbon dioxide. Biogas is a combustible mixture of methane and carbon dioxide (CO2). Raw biogas (60-70% methane) can be used as a low-grade fuel for low value on-site power generation. Commercial projects to upgrade biogas to pipeline quality natural gas, so-called ?Waste to Energy? processes, target much higher value for the methane.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be in generating an alternative source of energy, which in turn will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

While rammed earth is compacted in place, mud block is compacted into a brick using a mechanical press. While similar materials have been used for millenia, from a modern engineering standpoint, their structural properties are not well understood. Under this proposal, the materials will be analyzed using a computer modeling technique known as the finite element method. Such computer models can analyze the behavior of the walls under different conditions, including changing vertical weights and more horizontal forces such as earthquakes. The computer models will be enhanced to predict the propagation fractures through the brick and mortar of these structures. The focus of the analysis will be on how the buildings respond to horizontal forces. This analysis will be conducted in collaboration with experimental modeling of walls conducted at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.<br/><br/>The modeling will be used to create safer and more economical buildings out of these materials. These materials are used widely in India and a few other countries as they are economical and, properly constructed, durable. They are also seeing wider interest in the developed world as they have many advantages environmentally, saving energy both in construction and over a building?s lifetime. The computer techniques developed will also be applicable to many other materials, especially those that may fracture on existing weak interfaces or through the body, such as thin films on electronic semiconductors. Finally, the investigation will strengthen international research collaborations with the group in Bangalore.

The current biological production of methane in nature is solely due to the methanogens a diverse group of strictly anaerobic microorganisms belonging to the newly recognized domain of life, the archaea. By generating methane in a process known as methanogenesis, these organisms facilitate the anaerobic degradation of complex polymers such as cellulose and starch that are produced by plants and, in so doing, play a central role in the global carbon cycle. Further, one of the modes of methanogenesis in which carbon dioxide and hydrogen are converted to methane and water is considered one of the most ancient forms of respiration on Earth. Although much has been learned about the biochemical pathways of methane formation, little is known as to how the process is regulated in response to change in environmental conditions. Importantly, it is not known how methanogens cope with sporadic exposure to oxygen, a common occurrence in their natural habitats. It is possible that, under moderate oxygen contamination, the organisms modify their cellular machinery so that methanogenesis is sustained--an important capability since methane formation represents their only source of energy. Preliminary studies indicate that modification of key enzymes by thioredoxin (Trx) plays a role in this control strategy. Trx is a ubiquitous regulatory protein that acts in partnership with an enzyme, Trx reductase, in the fine control of metabolism. However, this system remains unexplored in the methanogens, despite the fact that every member of this group carries genes with the potential for encoding these proteins. In this project we will test the concept that Trx/Trx reductase-based control is a determinant for the biological production of methane. We will utilize two methanogenic archaea as models: (i) Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, a deeply rooted autotroph that inhabits deep-sea hydrothermal vents and produces methane exclusively from carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and (ii) Methanosarcina mazei, a late-evolving freshwater methanogen with more diverse methanogenic capability. The latter organism will be investigated in collaboration with the University of Kiel (Germany). The objectives of the study are: (i) To characterize the putative Trxs and Trx reductases of M. jannaschii and M. mazei using proteins over-produced in a methanogen host, thereby providing in vivo relevance to the investigation; (ii) To identify the enzymes and other proteins that Trx modifies in these organisms; and (iii) To determine the effect of Trx-based modification on the activity of select methanogenic enzymes. The work will provide an entrÈe to broader contemporary questions relating to the control of methanogenesis in natural habitats and to how redox-based control systems of bacteria, animals and plants evolved from those originating in the archaea.<br/><br/>Broader impact: <br/>This research will elucidate how methane-producing microorganisms cope with the challenging effects of exposure to oxygen in their habitats. Consequently, it will have broad societal and scientific implications relating to energy production, recycling of carbon in the biosphere and global warming. Greater insight into the regulation of methane formation raises the possibility of controlling its production in a useful manner?e.g., in bioreactors and sewage digesters. The project will integrate research and education through the training of two graduate students, four undergraduates, and a high school student. Undergraduate students and high school teachers from a current NSF-REU program directed by the PI (Microbiology in the Post-Genome Era) will have an opportunity to participate in this research. Every effort will be made to recruit from underrepresented minority groups at all levels. The collaborative training will broaden the research experience of graduate students in the participating laboratories at Virginia Tech, University of Kiel and University of California-Berkeley. Its scientific and societal relevance coupled with the participation of a diverse group of investigators at different career stages will enrich the project as well as the research experience of all participants.

Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-507. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. <br/><br/>This project proposal focuses on autonomic computing and systems, applicable to the important areas of security, fault management, and data centers. Planned are the prototypes to be deployed on test bed environments driven by the requirements from industry. The most interesting part of the proposal are applications to SCADA environments, which integrate monitoring, multi-level behavior analysis, decision fusion and risk analysis relative to security of SCADA environments. Other areas include autonomic peer-to-peer systems, as well as study related to the data centers, both at the application layer and data center hardware, where focus is on robustness.<br/><br/>The successful completion of this project will represent a significant step toward the design and deployment of highly secure SCADA systems and networks. In addition to security, the autonomic detection of anomalies in applications or subsystems of a datacenter addresses inefficiencies in data center design by eliminating the dependence on over-provisioning, which is a resource-inefficient strategy for ensuring quality of service by trying to offset any sub-system failures and malfunctions. The project has also potential for broader impact on data-intensive applications that leverage the availability of ad-hoc desktop grids for high-throughput computing.

Although there have been experimental investigations of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) melting, there are very few field-based studies of natural examples; existing work has focused largely on the age and chemical characteristics of granitoid bodies that are associated with UHP terrains and not on migmatites that commonly host UHP rocks. The generation of large amounts of partially molten crust during subduction has implications for mass and heat transfer from the mantle to the crust, orogenic growth by the addition of partially molten material generated at depth, and evolution of orogenic landscapes (e.g. development of plateaux). Moreover, the role of partially molten crust must be considered in understanding the mechanisms by which (U)HP rocks are overprinted during exhumation and subsequent orogenic processes. <br/><br/>This proposed Early Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is designed to obtain U/Pb zircon ages from magma bodies (leucosomes, pegmatites) spatially associated with eclogite to determine if zircon crystallized and thus melting occurred at UHP conditions. If this exploratory study is successful, it will set up the background canvas for a larger scale project with the ultimate goal of testing the hypothesis that, in some orogens, partial melting of continental crust occurs during continental subduction and is dynamically linked to the thermal-mechanical evolution of orogens and the exhumation of UHP rocks. The pursuit for adequate sample material will take place in the Western Gneiss Region (Norway) because it is an accessible locale with abundant exposure of UHP rocks that are hosted by migmatite; some eclogite bodies are themselves migmatitic.

The concept is a multi-pole energy generator to convert mechanical energy from vibrations into electrical energy for use in wireless sensor applications (lighting, smart phones, digital cameras). It will replace or supplement battery power in these kinds of units.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be the reduction of the use of standard batteries currently being used. This will result in less hazardous waste, longer-lived devices, and, possibly, conservation of global fossil fuel supplies. The need for standard batteries will be reduced, the lifespan of batteries will be enhanced, and it is expected that the smaller size, reduced profile, and increased energy voltage of the solution will ultimately reduce manufacturing costs.

Most importantly, it is necessary to disperse the oil over a wide range of the ocean water column and prevent the oil from reaching the shore where it can accumulate and create long term ecological hazards. The proposed research addresses the issues relating to creating oil droplets which can be effectively dispersed in the ocean water column. Requirements for dispersant efficacy include the following (1) The dispersant must be applied at the target oil at sufficient dosage to form droplets (2) It is important that the dispersant be applied early before the lighter components of the oil evaporate (3) The dispersant must be able to lower the oil-water interfacial tension sufficiently so that small oil droplets can be created which can be dispersed over the water column (4) It is preferable that the oil droplets remain dispersed long enough to be biodegraded by marine organisms. Alternatively, if the droplets are widely dispersed, it may be preferable to find a method to sediment the oil to the ocean floor where they can be biodegraded. The PIs propose to conduct research that will address the following aspects of dispersant design and efficacy evaluation (1) studies on the compositional variations of dispersants and their effects on droplet microstructure and stability (2) effects of compositional variations of oil characteristics to understand if droplet solidification can occur at the low temperatures and enhanced pressures relevant to deepwater injection of dispersants (3) introduction of methane into the system at high pressures and low temperatures to define the existence of gas hydrates in emulsion droplets (4) the implementation of highly biodegradable surfactants and biosurfactants to reduce toxicity potential significantly (5) the implementation of particle stabilized emulsions to gradually sediment the hydrocarbons and subject them to biodegradation.<br/><br/>The impact of this research would be broad, as several large constituencies are being affected by this deepwater oil spill. They include livelihoods for the fishermen in the Gulf area, the ecological impact on the wetlands which may cause unsustainable inland erosion around the Louisiana coastline and a threat to wildlife that may undermine the prevailing ecosystem. And, indeed the future of oil drilling at these extreme undersea environments may be at stake. The PIs plan to disseminate the results of our research through on line postings as quickly as we can confirm their scientific validity, so that the broader scientific community can take advantage of them rapidly. Over the longer term (but clearly of less consequence at this moment of crisis), this research, which has a strong scientific underpinning but is focused on rapidly solving a critical national problem represents an ideal learning experience for graduate students. They plan to present the results of this work, as well as the broader problem and potential solutions to the local community through evening lectures, to students in our colloidal phenomena classes, and to high school students and teachers so that they are well-educated on the different aspects of oil spills. Both Tulane and URI have strong, streamlined programs at the universities for pursuing these avenues.

Multiple length scales such as grain size, shell thickness, and diameter of sphere exist within an individual structure. Specifically, our gold nanospheres are about 100 nm in diameter, and feature a polycrystalline shell with a thickness ranging from 20 to 50 nm, and grain size around 5 nm. Such combination provides a ?golden? opportunity to explore the effects of structural hierarchy on the deformation mechanisms of nanoscale materials. Due to their hollow nature, the gold nanospheres can be easily observed and tested with in-situ TEM nanoindentation without elaborate sample preparation. They can be positioned precisely into an addressable array using the ?electrostatic funneling method?. This greatly facilitates nanoindentation experiments, enabling a statistical examination. Model polycrystalline hollow nanoparticles with similar characteristics will be simulated with state-of-the-art multiscale theoretical/computational techniques that combine Molecular Dynamics and Discrete Element Method. Experimental input from the in-situ TEM nanoindentation will greatly facilitate the multiscale modeling, specifically the critical issues of time-acceleration and coarse-graining. The obtained simulation results will help comprehend experimental data and identify deformation mechanisms with atomistic resolution. <br/><br/>The general mechanical behavior of nanoscale metals is of great interest for technological applications such as new ultrastrong structural materials, microelectronics and micro- and nano-electromechanical devices and systems. If successful, this research will help establish important design principles targeting such applications. The proposed combination of Molecular Dynamics with Distinct Element Method to tackle problems at different length scales is expected to find broad applications in the modeling community. The proposed research program is integrated with a multi-layered education and outreach program that includes development of new courses designed to educate students in an interdisciplinary field, summer camps for K-12 students, and outreach activities through MRSEC-UMN, existing REU, cyber module development, and demonstrations at high schools and the Science Museum of Minnesota. A coordinated outreach plan in partnership with the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers is proposed to provide opportunities to underrepresented groups by targeting and involving the large Hispanic population in the State of Texas, which includes a minority recruitment program, a SciTech Latino Summer Camp for K-12 Hispanic students, and a public awareness component.

These four STEM teacher education programs have recently or are still undergoing radical changes, with their individual institutional evolutions still in the beginning stages. The changes these programs have committed to design and implement through the campus-specific processes now underway were a requirement for their eligibility to participate in the Woodrow Wilson Foundation's Indiana STEM Teaching Fellowship. By changing their STEM programs to meet a set of standards established by the Foundation, each of the universities became eligible to receive funding for 20 Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellows every year for at least two years. Although each new program conforms to Woodrow Wilson standards, they each are using a different process to plan, adopt, and implement changes. This offers an immediate, urgent, and distinctive research opportunity - four STEM teacher education programs within the same state undergoing significant change simultaneously - for examining best practices in STEM teacher education and change strategies. Because the institutions have different missions and cultures (e.g., Purdue is a land-grant research university; IUPUI is an urban-serving university; the University of Indianapolis is a private institution; and Ball State University is a comprehensive public university which happens to have a residential specialized secondary school on the campus for talented high school students in math, science, and the humanities), variation across the four makes them as a group representative of a large proportion of the total 'universe' of teacher preparation programs in the United States. The project will set the stage for a comprehensive study of the effectiveness of these four different approaches to STEM teacher education. The evaluation, comparison, and documentation of the change process being undertaken by these universities will have intellectual merit in its own right, but also practical value by offering case studies for how very different institutions can create effective STEM teacher education programs.

The proposed automated procedure will start with collection of video frames using a high-resolution video camera mounted on an inspector?s hardhat. Then, state-of-the-art detection and extraction algorithms will be employed to detect RC columns and identify and characterize column damage. Component damage will be classified using empirically based models, and component damage will be used to determine the damage state of the building. Building damage state, configuration and type will be used to query a set of fragility curves defining the likelihood of building collapse during an aftershock and, thereby, provide an improved understanding of risk. Deliverables include a catalog of fundamental visible damage characteristics, model-based recognition and analysis tools, demonstration and validation via hardware, documentation of research results, engineering student education, and outreach seminars to building evaluators.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will provide the first robust method in the area of structural member and damage recognition from video. This scientific breakthrough will allow researchers to integrate this work in as-built building information modeling, project monitoring, virtual and augmented reality and other applications of importance to the engineering community. Also, this will be the first known study to quantitatively link visual damage in a building component (column or wall), to the likelihood of building collapse using robust probabilistic methods. The discoveries sought in this project are expected to serve as a foundation for a new knowledge base in damage assessment and to promote intellectual cross-pollination among the fields of computer vision and structural engineering. The results will be disseminated to allow the creation of commercial software that have increased precision, reduced cost, and work with reduced weight devices. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students and K-12 students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research.

Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	MPS	1762	9161, AMPP	$0.00	TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Transition metal oxides continue to pose great challenges to our understanding of the relationships among chemistry, crystal structure, and physical properties in complex solids. These challenges arise due to the often very strong interactions between d electrons in oxides, an interaction that continues to be difficult or impossible to treat by theoretical models. In addition, the electronic states and crystal structures that are found are often a consequence of delicate balances between nearly energetically equivalent forces; the electronic, magnetic, and structural characteristics of the compounds often interact in complex, subtle, and surprising ways. This Solid State and Materials Chemistry supported program directly addresses the critical factors that cause some transition metal oxides to display localized electron behavior and local moment magnetism, while others, quite similar, display itinerant electron behavior and non-magnetic or exotic magnetic states. Of particular interest will be oxides based on transition metals in the 4d and 5d family, where magnetism is not as commonly encountered as in the more frequently studied 3d compounds. The research concentrates on the discovery and characterization of ruthenium, iridium and rhenium-based oxides that are expected to straddle the border between localized and itinerant electronic behavior. These particular materials allow addressing the balance between these different behaviors from different perspectives: ruthenates for example are very often metallic conductors, with itinerant electrons, though sometimes displaying localized electronic states, while iridates and rhenates tend more toward localized behavior in spite of the fact that 5d orbitals are nominally more extended and expected to form itinerant electronic states. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Discovering new materials and determining what their physical properties are is a critical link in the scientific and engineering chain, which leads to the introduction of new technologies that greatly enhance our quality of life, ranging from consumer electronics, computing, and communications systems to systems for medical imaging and diagnosis. The materials, now daily used in these technologies were developed through decades of basic and applied research, with solid state and materials chemists taking a leading role. Many of our current technologies, and many of those proposed for the future, are based on chemical compounds of the transition elements - the metallic elements at the center of the periodic table. Revolutionary scientific discoveries in the recent past in oxides of the transition metals, such as superconductivity at high temperatures, giant responses of materials - resistance to applied magnetic fields, and the generation of large currents in temperature gradients, have shown that the scientific communities' understanding of such compounds is surprisingly poor. This Solid State and Materials Chemistry supported program directly addresses one of the deficiencies in our understanding of transition metal based materials - What are the critical factors that cause some of these materials to be magnetic, while others, quite similar, are not? This will be accomplished through the study of several classes of transition metal oxides that straddle the border between magnetism and non-magnetism. Graduate and undergraduate students who work on this project will be trained to become future researchers in the critical area of materials for technological applications, a skill widely sought by forward looking American industries. Beyond the technological results and direct undergraduate and graduate student education and training, the PI will continue his work with primary and secondary school students to help to promote students to enter the science pipeline, and will actively encourage the participation of women and minorities in the project.

Novick and Herbert Pickettt of Wesleyan University and Dr. Zhenhong Yu of Aerodyne Research Inc. in the investigation of intermolecular interactions between molecular hydrogen (H2) and transition metal compounds using high-resolution Fourier Transform rotational spectroscopy in combination with high-level ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics. Specifically, the group explores the chemical nature of bonding between H2 and its various binding partners such as ZnO, CuO, CuF and other transition metal halides and chalcogens (oxygen and sulfur). The investigation of the structure and dynamics of these medium strength H2-metal complexes enables the group to determine the influence of the electronic structure of these transition metal solids on the bond strength of molecular hydrogen. These experimental and theoretical investigations produce important structural, energetic, and dynamical information that provides detailed insights into what further modification of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are required for hydrogen storage at room temperature.<br/><br/>While hydrogen is not a primary energy source, it is a very good energy carrier. Hydrogen has almost triple the combustion energy of gasoline per unit weight. This factor, combined with the fact that the combustion of hydrogen produces only water and no greenhouse gases (e.g., carbon dioxide), makes hydrogen storage potentially very important for the transportation industry of the future. This research examines how hydrogen is stored in MOFs, crystalline polymers containing metal ions or small metal-containing molecules or ions that are linked together with organic linkers. MOFS have very large surface areas and are useful in absorbing large volumes of gases in a relatively small volume. The unique instrumentation that is developed and used in this study is shared with a large number of scientists from other institutions (for example, San Diego State University, the University of Texas at Brownsville, and Union College), enabling cutting-edge research efforts on a broad range of research topics in addition to the development of alternative energy systems.
1021573	Signal integration and modulation by the Axin complex during Wnt/b-catenin signaling	IOS	ANIMAL DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANSMS	07/01/2010	05/21/2012	Marcel Wehrli	OR	Oregon Health and Science University	Continuing grant	Steven L.

Secreted proteins of the Wnt family represent one such signal. Wnts elicit precise changes in gene expression mediated by increased levels of the transcription factor Beta-catenin. Too much, or too little, of this signal leads to patterning defects and/or disease. <br/><br/>Wnts induce a Beta-catenin signal by blocking the function of the central pathway regulator, a protein complex assembled around the scaffold protein Axin. Multiple, potentially conflicting, inputs interact within the Axin complex. How these different inputs are integrated and dynamically controlled during Wnt signal transduction remains unclear. The focus of this project is to establish a dynamic model of Wnt/B-catenin signaling by identifying the location of the Axin complex and its sub-complexes during signal transduction. Genetic manipulations will then be used to determine the functional significance of the findings.<br/><br/>The current model of the Wnt/B-catenin pathway is based largely on studies using overexpression in tissue culture, and protein-protein interactions in vitro. The functional significance of these findings for normal signaling in vivo remains unclear. Significantly, in the proposed studies, the Wnt/B-catenin pathway will be analyzed in the model organism Drosophila, allowing its analysis in the normal cellular context and under physiological conditions. Additionally, visualization of the Axin protein complexes in real-time will establish a dynamic picture of Wnt signaling not achieved in previous studies. These studies are expected to identify novel regulatory interactions and may open the Wnt pathway to pharmacological intervention. <br/>This project will provide an opportunity for one graduate student, and two undergraduate students to engage in cutting edge research. In addition, it will allow the PI to introduce K-12 students to basic development and genetics and to promote a science-based curriculum in local schools.

This research will examine an array of different campaign activities to determine whether the involvement of parties and interest groups varies depending on the type of selection system, the competitiveness of the race, the broader political environment, and the type of group. This project will survey political parties, interest groups, and court candidates to determine the type and level of involvement of parties and interest groups in the selection of state supreme court justices. This data will help to clarify how the selection process affects the impartiality, independence, and accountability of state supreme court systems.<br/><br/>Scholars, policymakers, and the public have long debated whether state supreme court justices should be elected or appointed, and if the former, what type of election system is preferable. This debate is often framed as a fundamental dichotomy between judicial independence and judicial accountability, the former usually associated with judicial appointment, the latter with judicial election. However, despite the rapidly expanding research in this area, it is still not well understood to what extent political parties and interest groups have become involved in selecting justices, though their participation implicates both accountability and independence. The findings from this project will contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of judicial elections.
1035486	RAPID: Situationally Motivated Self-Construal and Collective Action: Do Collective Threats Motivate Prioritization of Group Goals via Heightened Interdependent Self-Construals?	BCS	SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY	06/15/2010	06/10/2010	Clay Routledge	ND	North Dakota State University Fargo	Standard Grant	Brett W. Pelham	05/31/2011	$39,837.00		clay.routledge@ndsu.edu	Dept 4000 - PO Box 6050	FARGO	ND	581086050	7012318045	SBE	1332	1332, 9150, 7914	$0.00	Psychological research indicates that much of human social behavior is regulated by the self and motivated by self-interest. However, the human species thrives, in part, because of sophisticated group functioning in which people put immediate self-interests aside temporarily to pursue broader collective goals. Theory and research regarding the motivational underpinnings of collective action have yet to consider fully how the self is implicated in behavior that places broader social concerns over immediate self-interest. If the self drives a great deal of human social behavior and is driven by self-interest, how could the self be mobilized to pursue collective goals? This research examines this question in the context of an expected natural disaster, the 2010 Fargo, North Dakota flood. Specifically, this research offers a shifting self model that suggests that the self-concept is flexible such that a collective threat (the expected flood) triggers broader conceptions of self to regulate behavior in the service of collective goals. Specifically, it is predicted that the prospect of a natural disaster that threatens a community will cause people to define themselves in terms of group membership (interdependent self-construal) instead of unique identity (independent self-construal). Furthermore, this heightened sense of interdependent self-construal is expected to increase community engagement (e.g., volunteering to put out sandbags, which will take place whether the flood occurs or not) which will in turn lead to a number of positive psychological states (e.g., increased feelings of self-esteem). To test these predictions, participants from the flood threatened community and participants from an unthreatened community will complete measures of perceived collective threat, self-definition (independent and interdependent self-construal), community engagement (e.g., volunteering), and other related psychological states (e.g., self-esteem, meaning) before the expected flood, during the time of the expected flood, and shortly after the expected flood. If a severe collective threat impacts self-definition as predicted, then participants in the threatened community should define themselves in interdependent terms to a greater extent than participants in unthreatened communities. Further, within the flood threatened community, the more participants perceive the flood as a serious threat to the community, the more they should define themselves in interdependent terms. In addition, if this shift in self-definition motivates collective action, level of interdependent self-construal should predict level of community engagement within the threatened community. If there is no flood, self-evaluations are expected to return to baseline levels once it is clear that no flood will occur. <br/><br/>This research will provide a deeper understanding of how individuals are motivated to act as a collective, putting aside their own immediate personal concerns in order to effectively confront a broader community threat. Communities and nations face a number of threats (e.g., natural disasters, crime, climate change) that require individuals to work together as a collective. Thus, any gained knowledge on the psychology of community engagement may prove vital for cities, government agencies, and other organizations wishing to inspire people to give of themselves to help the common good.
1010669	DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Structured groups and the evolution of cooperation in pathogenic bacterial biofilms	IOS	ANIMAL BEHAVIOR	07/15/2010	05/07/2012	Jeremiah Hackett	AZ	University of Arizona	Standard Grant	Michelle M. Elekonich	06/30/2013	$14,894.00	William Driscoll	jpepper1@email.arizona.edu	888 N Euclid Ave	Tucson	AZ	857194824	5206266000	BIO	7659	9178, 9179, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	Bacteria are often thought to be the very simplest organisms, but this view is being quickly replaced by an appreciation for the very complex behavior and social lives of bacteria. We now know that most bacteria in nature exist in massive, three-dimensional communities called biofilms, which are often likened to 'microbial cities'. Others even suggest that biofilms are most similar to multicellular tissues, like those that make up plants and animals. In either case, we now know that bacteria communicate through the use of chemical signals, migrate in concert to build multicellular structures, and pay a metabolic 'cost' to produce an array of shared, beneficial molecules. This last form of cooperation seems especially challenging to explain: why would evolution favor a cooperative type, if a selfish type can get all of the same benefits without paying a cost? There could be three possible answers to this question: 1) perhaps a cell that produces a beneficial molecule can itself benefit more than a 'free rider' neighbor who does not, 2) because bacterial reproduction is clonal, 'neighbors' in biofilms tend to be clone-mates, which means cooperators will tend to be around cooperators while free riders are near free riders, or 3) entire biofilms with more cooperators will contribute more offspring to the global population than biofilms with more free riders. The proposed experiments will precisely measure competition between cooperators and free riders in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa using three-dimensional fluorescent microscopy to map the spread of each type in a growing biofilm. These experiments will strengthen an established, interdisciplinary collaboration between William Driscoll and the geneticists Leland and Elizabeth Pierson and greatly enhance the training of William Driscoll and an undergraduate assistant in methods in microbiology and confocal microscopy. Finally, the results of these important experiments will be presented at the international scientific conference Evolution in 2011 and published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

The tunable laser is based on a 2.4 micron wavelength laser diode that utilizes antimonide III-V semiconductor materials and is coupled to an external cavity. A high-brightness source will be a great aid for spectroscopy in turbid solutions with low optical throughput like whole blood. The tunable laser spectrometer will have significantly higher brightness than is available with conventional broad-band sources. The wide tunability required to differentiate the spectral signatures of the target analytes from those of other biomolecules will be achieved first by broadening the gain spectrum through a series of quantum wells with staggered emission wavelengths, and second, by fabricating laser devices using a curved-waveguide geometry to suppress optical feedback from the laser diode facets. An intracavity, temperature-controlled acousto-optic tunable filter will provide the necessary wavelength stability and tuning range, giving the instrument a rugged, compact, all-solid state design with no moving parts. The tunable laser diode will enable direct spectroscopic measurements in small volumes of whole blood.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to significantly enhance patient care. The point-of-care monitor based on this tunable laser spectrometer will provide automated measurement of key blood metabolites at the bedside and semi-continuous monitoring of metabolic status. The monitor will periodically collect absorption spectra of a small blood sample, and reinfuse the blood into the patient through an arterial catheter, allowing regular monitoring of glucose, urea, creatinine and lactate. Regular monitoring of glucose enables the use of intensive insulin therapy, which has been shown to improve the outcome of intensive care unit patients. Tracking urea and creatinine concentrations provides a measure of renal function that can be used for early identification of acute kidney failure. Detection of elevated lactate concentrations can be used as an indicator of metabolic distress for unstable patients. The tunable laser-based point-of-care monitor can provide more information than is available now without increasing costs. Unlike standard blood chemistry assays, optical measurements do not require reagents, so there is no incremental cost to limit the frequency of monitoring. Since the measurement results in no blood loss, it is safe to use in patients who would be intolerant of frequent blood draws.

Advances by this team for the first conjugated polymer based tunnel diode circuitry using room temperature negative differential resistance (NDR) enable new opportunities for low-power consumption circuitry (logic, memory and mixed-signal). NDR circuitry can provide (i) component count reduction (more computational power per unit area), (ii) lower power consumption (fewer devices per logic function). This extends beyond the functionality and on-board intelligence of organic RFIDs while operating autonomously powered. The approach will use a systematic exploration and development of polymer tunnel diodes in three vertically integrated research thrusts: (i) novel materials, (ii) device technology, and (iii) system applications and impact.<br/><br/>The proposed project will establish a world-class program in polymer tunnel diodes that will advance low-power autonomous powered electronics, low-temperature processing of high-k dielectrics, understanding of role of defects in tunneling through ultra-thin high-k dielectrics, biosensors and polymer solar cells. <br/><br/>The integrated research, education and technology transfer will advance SmartCard technology (credit cards and identification cards) with greater on-board intelligence, permitting enhanced data manipulation, distributed computing, radio frequency (RF) input/output (I/O) datalinks, and possibly even hardwired encryption algorithms to protect personal data better than traditional magnetic strips. The proposed research project will create a unique and focused program that incorporates a wide-range of external collaborations with industry, government labs and academia.

The center was established in 2005 and is completing the first five years as an I/UCRC with a focus on the prevention of injuries to children and youth in traffic accidents. Numerous outstanding research products have been disseminated, including findings, educational materials, computational models and intellectual property. The center faculty and particularly the Center Director are exceptionally well-qualified to perform research in this field. The planned research for the next five years represents expansion of the current work into areas recently identified in the 40 plus projects conducted up to this point, as well as extension into research related to sports injury. The new theme encompasses sports injury prevention, concussion prevention and treatment and rehabilitative and surgical devices for injury treatment.<br/><br/>CChIPS serves as the facilitator, to conduct and disseminate industry-relevant, scientifically complex research. As the only national platform for cooperative industry-university research on child injury prevention science and engineering, CChIPS is uniquely positioned to address critical issues facing the automotive industry regarding the future of safe transport of this population. Results from CChIPS are disseminated through technical meetings, intellectual property, and through development and support of web sites suitable for the general public.

The research team will measure snow conditions on the ground at the time of the LiDAR data acquisition in April-May, since snow conditions change rapidly. In addition, the team will collect control point data so that the two LiDAR flights can be carefully georeferenced, reducing errors in snow pack due to location errors. The team will also measure vegetation characteristics for the full leaf-on flights in late August-early September. The measurements made during the bare-ground season will also be used to calculate the snow depths that existed across the watershed during the earlier LiDAR flight.<br/><br/>LiDAR is a powerful tool that provides detailed information concerning topography and landform characteristics at high resolution. Having such data available is crucial to the mission of the Critical Zone Observatories, which are exploring the processes in the region of the Earth's surface that important to sustaining life. This project will enable the LiDAR data to be used with extreme accuracy so that processes within the Boulder Creek watershed can be analyzed more effectively. The effort will help train a graduate student in spatial data acquisition, and several undergraduate students in the details of LiDAR processing and surveying.

The produced hydrogen can be used for industrial applications while the produced biodiesel can be used to satisfy transportation needs, thus enabling greater energy self sufficiency in an environmentally responsible manner. Production of these bio-fuels in this manner represents a major departure from current technology of producing them from fossil fuels, thereby reducing the Nation?s dependence on imported fuels. Ultimately, the team will develop pilot scale data (1-1.5 liters) and use the empirical data to define economic rationale for scale up. <br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to establish baseline values for the hydrogen and bio-fuel production from pilot scale facilities, potentially reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from fertilizer production.
1039402	What are the Next Steps to Mitigate the Threat Posed by Environmental Estrogens? A Workshop Designed to Focus the Field And Provide a Research 2010 Decade, May 2010, Milwaukee WI	CBET	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING	06/01/2010	06/03/2010	Paige Novak	MN	University of Minnesota-Twin Cities	Standard Grant	Debra Reinhart	05/31/2011	$20,878.00	Deborah Swackhamer	novak010@tc.umn.edu	200 OAK ST SE	Minneapolis	MN	554552070	6126245599	ENG	1440	015E, 021E	$0.00	Principal Investigator: Paige Novak<br/><br/><br/>Proposal No: CBET-1039402<br/><br/>Given the high potency of some estrogenic chemicals at extremely low levels (1 ng/L), environmental estrogens (EEs) are potentially the most dangerous pollutants that humans produce. EEs include natural and synthetic hormones, PPCPs, plant-based phytoestrogens, and a range of industrial products and byproducts. It is known that they cause reproductive and behavioral problems in fish at environmentally-relevant concentrations. It is also now known that there are sources of these compounds to our surface water that had previously been ignored. Questions remain as to what the most relevant sources of EEs are, where their greatest threat lies (both to ecosystems and to human health), what their fate is in various environments, and what needs to be done to stop the use and/or discharge of these potent pollutants into the environment before an environmental disaster occurs. Unlike many other environmental challenges that we have faced (DDT) or do face (global climate change), this is one that we have the potential to solve before much damage is done. To do so, we must act quickly and focus the talent and creativity of the relevant scientists and engineers in the field on a set of cohesive research questions. The PIs plan to organize a workshop that will span two and a half days, the outcome of which will be a paper that will be submitted to a high-profile journal such as Science. This paper will lay out what the participants feel are the most urgent questions in this field and will act as a means to focus and engage the wider scientific community in the hope that we can better address and work to solve the environmental estrogen problem before it has significant and widespread effects on ecosystems or human health. There is a ?critical mass? of researchers spanning the topics of estrogen sources, their environmental fate, and the ecological and human health effects of these compounds. Unfortunately, these researchers are not working in concert and those working in certain areas (fate) do not necessarily communicate with those working in other areas (human health impacts). The field lacks leadership and is not focused on a common and clear set of questions that will allow it to truly solve this problem. This workshop will focus those working in the field of environmental estrogens on a cohesive research agenda. This will enable them to find a true solution to the problem of estrogen pollution. The outcome of this workshop will be a very public document, but more focused and higher quality research should also result. This will result in drinking water and surface water that better safeguards human and ecological health.

The project is utilizing new continuous GPS (CGPS) stations located in northern Baja California to measure transient crustal motions following the earthquake. The new 6-station network complements and enhances the EarthScope PBO network, providing needed data for studies of lithospheric rheology and for monitoring earthquake hazards in northern Baja and southern California. A model for pre-earthquake crustal velocities at the six new CGPS stations is being developed for direct comparison with post-earthquake motions, using existing campaign GPS measurements collected over the past two decades. <br/><br/>New data from the continuous GPS stations and precise estimates for pre-earthquake crustal velocities are forming the basis for an evaluation of perturbations to the velocity field caused by the earthquake, including determination of realistic uncertainties in the earthquake-related velocity change estimates. These geodetic results are enabling a robust study of crust and mantle rheology and the role that postseismic processes play in the evolution of crustal stresses in southern California and northern Mexico, with implications for earthquake hazards assessment. This project is helping to support one PhD student at The University of Arizona, and is strengthening scientific ties with our Mexican collaborators at CICESE, who are our natural partners in earthquake science and hazard research associated with the southern San Andreas fault system.

Early in flower development, a group of related proteins, known as MADS-box proteins, plays a key role in establishing the correct organ identity for each whorl. Stamen (male reproductive structures) and petal identities, for example are controlled by the combined activity of two distinct MADS-box proteins, known as the B class proteins. These two B class proteins, which are found in all angiosperm lineages, have been shown to function only when both are present in some groups of angiosperms, while in other groups the proteins appear to function without a partner. It is not clear what these proteins are doing when they act without a partner, nor is it clear how distinct angiosperm groups evolved so that their B class proteins either function alone or in combination. This project will investigate the function and evolution of B class protein interaction in the grass family, which has B class proteins that must act together. A mutant in which a grass B class protein is disrupted will be characterized to understand its function in the grass family. B class proteins will be isolated from diverse grass members and closely related grasses. These proteins will then be assayed for their ability to act alone or with their respective partners in order to understand the point at which grasses evolved the requirement for both partners. The protein sequences will be assayed for evidence of natural selection that may have facilitated this evolution. Ultimately, the precise protein modifications that allowed the evolution of these interesting protein interactions will be elucidated by this research. The project will provide training for a postdoctoral associate, graduate student and several undergraduates. In addition, local high school student will be involved by creation of a novel module to investigate the ethical implications of transgenic crop technologies.

Specific goals of the proposal are: a) preparing and characterizing new multicomponent hydrogen bonded assemblies; b) understanding the dynamics of self- and hybrid assembly processes; and c) exploring the use of these assemblies as molecular devices, delivery systems, organocatalysts and smart materials. <br/><br/>With the support of this EAGER award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program, Professor Julius Rebek, of the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute is exploring the synthesis and properties of molecules that completely surround other molecules. Such arrangements represent unique phases of matter in chemistry and lead to materials with potentially broad technological applications. This project serves as an excellent training ground for students in fundamental research because it exposes them to broad experiences in organic synthesis, compound characterization, spectroscopy, as well as issues in chirality, data storage and nanotechnology. This project will have an important impact on society because it will permit the Principal investigator to host, mentor and cultivate talented high school teachers and devise research plans for future high school student and teacher internships. These internships provide the early steps in the education of the nations future professors of chemistry.
1019886	Experimental Constraints on Crystal Liquid Ni and Mn Partitioning in Mafic and Ultramafic Systems	EAR	PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY	06/15/2010	05/24/2011	Edward Stolper	CA	California Institute of Technology	Continuing grant	Jennifer Wade	02/28/2014	$196,370.00		ems@gps.caltech.edu	1200 E California Blvd	PASADENA	CA	911250600	6263956219	GEO	1573	0000	$0.00	A fundamental goal of igneous petrology is to understand the present chemical composition of the Earth's crust and mantle (two of the major structural components of the planet; the third component is the Earth's core) based on a study of rocks that crystallized from molten or partially molten material. Although samples of the Earth's interior are occasionally carried up in volcanic eruptions, much of the information concerning the chemical composition of the mantle must be inferred from partial melts that have risen and been erupted on the Earth's surface (these rocks are called basalts). Two of the best 'windows' into the mantle are basalts from mid-ocean ridges (MOR) and basalts from ocean islands (e.g., Hawaii). While petrologists have a good zeroth-order understanding of the origin of mid-ocean ridge basalts (e.g., the composition of the parcels of mantle that melt to produce these rocks), the same cannot be said for ocean island basalts and several hypotheses are currently being debated in the literature. The experimental study proposed here is designed to help distinguish between these competing hypotheses, which largely revolve around the question of how different the mantle sources of ocean island basalt source are to those of MOR basalts. Answering this question has important implications for understanding the chemical heterogeneity of the Earth's mantle and processes that produce rocks that are seen on the surface of the Earth.<br/><br/>The mineral olivine is commonly found in basalts from MORs, ocean islands, and continental flood basalt provinces and analyses of a large number of these olivines show that their NiO and FeO/MnO concentrations are positively correlated (olivines with low NiO also have low FeO/MnO, while those with high NiO tend to have high FeO/MnO). The low NiO-FeO/MnO end of the array is defined by olivines from MORB and Icelandic rocks whereas the high NiO-FeO/MnO end is largely defined by olivines from Hawaiian, RÈunion, and Karoo rocks, which can have NiO contents up to ~0.6 wt%. Olivines from spinel lherzolites (the rock type thought to represent the bulk of the upper mantle and the source of MOR basalts) lie approximately in the middle of the array with NiO values of 0.35-0.40 wt%. Much of the effort to explain this global array has focused on the high NiO-FeO/MnO portion, since it is difficult to generate partial melts of spinel lherzolite with normal mantle concentrations of NiO that will crystallize olivine with >0.4 wt% NiO using any of the common 1-atm-based expressions for the partitioning of NiO between olivine and a basaltic melt (designated as DNi). Models to date include melting of an olivine-free source (a hybrid mixture of spinel lherzolite plus silica-rich melt of oceanic crust that has been subducted back into the mantle), addition of small amounts of outer core (rich in Ni and Fe) to the sources of the lavas that display these high NiO-Fe/Mn olivines, and the idea that DNi varies with pressure and temperature. Efforts to calculate quantitatively the observed NiO and FeO/MnO contents of partial melts of spinel lherzolite or mantle rocks with little or no olivine as well as the olivines that crystal from these melts on ascent are hampered by a lack of high-pressure and temperature Ds with which to calculate NiO and MnO contents of liquids and coexisting crystalline phases. The goal of this project is to determine a set of NiO and MnO partition coefficients between olivine and basaltic melt over a range of pressures, temperatures, and bulk compositions and to, then, use these experimentally determined values to evaluate the different hypotheses that have been put forth to explain the global NiO-FeO/MnO array.

The rational design of crystal structures, in particular noncentrosymmetric materials, and how to differentiate polar, polar-chiral, and chiral structures, is an ongoing theme in crystal engineering. These materials are essential for the modification of the amplitude, phase, or frequency of an optical signal. Polar distortions in metal centered octahedra are the origin of the nonlinear optical response in metal oxides. Octahedrally coordinated transition metal cations in groups 4,5,6 are unstable in mixed metal oxides with respect to intraoctahedral distortions, which can be understood through the second order Jahn-Teller theorem. This program explores research on noncentrosymmetric structures based on acentric transition metal oxyfluorides. These materials will provide a large and new class of solids with properties associated with piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, ferroelectricity and second harmonic generation (SHG), all properties associated with noncentrosymmetric space groups. This work is supported by a grant from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research.<br/><br/>Non-technical Summary<br/>The rational design of structures based on the chemical nature of molecular components, a longstanding and exciting research topic in organic solid-state chemistry, is an emerging theme of crystal engineering. Technologies that require high-performance nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with enhanced optical properties, however, depend on inorganic materials that exhibit large optical nonlinearities. Structures lacking inversion symmetry are a requirement for important current and future technologies that have been created by numerous inventions during the past two decades. These materials provide a large and new class of solids for studies in basic science associated with the noncentrosymmetric space groups. We propose an exploratory research program on these materials, which were highlighted recently in an article entitled China's Crystal Cache (Nature 2009, 457, 953-955). In this Nature article the critical national need for synthesis-based efforts to discover and to grow suitable crystals of these new materials was emphasized. This work is supported by a grant from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research at the National Science Foundation (DMR-1005827).

Aiming at generating in-depth knowledge for developing future-generation information technologies using nanoscale phase-change systems, the project is composed of two major parts: (i) exploitation of multi-level phase transition behavior in one-dimensional chalcogenide nanowires, discovering mechanism and technology pathway towards ultra-high-density information processing in future electronic systems, and (ii) investigation of ultimate materials scalability and energy efficiency in binary/ternary chalcogenides with deeply-scaled physical dimensions. Combining multiple Co-PI's different technical expertise, the team plans to build up comprehensive understandings of phase-change phenomena in aggressively scaled materials systems using both experimental and computational approaches with strong support from industry partner. The concept of information technology based of phase-change behavior in materials is recognized as one of the most successful innovations in microelectronics industry in this decade, leading to a prospective main-stream post-silicon technology. If successful, the proposed research would bring in substantial impact in this important technology by generating largely demanded knowledge to break through the well recognized technical barriers: power-efficiency and scalability.<br/>Non-technical: The research opens opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to acquire interdisciplinary research experience in nanoscale sciences, material engineering, nanofabrication, and computational nanotechnology. The efforts broaden participation of under-represented groups in research programs at the two universities. Outreach activities comprise on-site demonstration of nanoscale scientific and engineering techniques for K-12 students in the Tech Valley of upstate New York and the greater Seattle Area. The dissemination of research results by journal publications and presentations at international conferences, and its inclusion in new curriculum development at both universities will ensure broad impacts to scientific, educational, and general public communities.

The approach is to synthesize 1,3-difluoro-substituted aryl monomers with a variety of pendant electron withdrawing groups.  The reactivity of these monomers towards nucleophilic aromatic substitution will be studied and promising systems will be translated into polymerization reactions.  The resulting polymers would be meta-linked counterparts to several well known classes of polyarylenes.  The thermal and mechanical properties of the polymers will be determined.  The broader impacts involve training master's and undergraduate students and disseminating results in publications and seminars.<br/> <br/>This work will enhance our fundamental understanding about how to synthesize new polymers (plastics) with high thermal stability and beneficial mechanical properties.  The results of these studies could have many important long term impacts on applications in which engineering plastics are important, including automotive, packaging, and aerospace industries.
1005661	Exploring problems in 3- and (3+1)-dimensional topology	DMS	TOPOLOGY	07/01/2010	06/10/2010	Martin Scharlemann	CA	University of California-Santa Barbara	Standard Grant	Joanna Kania-Bartoszynska	06/30/2014	$141,798.00		mgscharl@math.ucsb.edu	Office of Research	Santa Barbara	CA	931062050	8058934188	MPS	1267		$0.00	In general, Scharlemann's research has centered on the theory of classical knots and of 3-manifolds, in particular on the use of Heegaard splittings and of related notions from classical knot theory. The focus has been on the behavior of surfaces contained in the 3-manifolds, but with a modern viewpoint: Add ideas from graph theory to old-fashioned combinatorial arguments on surface intersections; add sutured manifold theory to the classical notion of hierarchies on 3-manifolds (so parameterizing surfaces and estimates of the Thurston norm help control and understand the topology); and add thin position to the classic tools of Morse theory, so handles of the critical index are added not all at once, but as slowly as possible. <br/>Recently Scharlemann has applied these and similar new tools towards resolving questions in the topology of 4-manifolds, most prominently the Schoenflies Conjecture, but also long-standing questions about the connection between classical links, their possible slicings in the 4-ball, and how surgery can affect both. For example, recent work with Abby Thompson and Bob Gompf uses sutured manifold and Heegaard theory to search for the easiest possible counterexample to the Generalized Property R Conjecture. We show that there is a 2-component likely counterexample containing a square knot (or, maybe seen as easier, a genus 1 knot, so far undetermined) as a component. These and other results may be the first steps towards a useful application of 3-manifold ideas to those intriguing topological questions which are sometimes called 3 + 1-dimensional because they ask how 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds are interrelated. <br/><br/><br/>One of the most basic observations about the world around us is that it has three dimensions. The broad intent of this proposal is to help us better understand spaces with precisely this property: anyone living in one would see their world as of this sort, namely 3-dimensional. Beyond modeling the universe around us, these spaces, called 3-manifolds, support interesting phenomena such as knotting, in which a simple object like a garden-hose (or a string of DNA, or, more generally, a chemical molecule) can lie in space in a complicated way. These 3-manifolds also lie on the edge of spaces with additional deep physical significance, those that locally appear to be 4-dimensional spaces (such as physicists often refer to as space-time). Our emerging understanding of 3-dimensional manifolds can also help us understand long-standing questions about these 4-dimensional manifolds. The particular emphasis in this proposal is on questions that sit on the edge between 3- and 4-dimensional manifold theory and incorporate knotting phenomena from both. The dimensions are interesting in part because they model the universe in which we live; knotting within them is a tool to deepen our understanding of how such spaces relate.

It will expand fundamental knowledge in the field of low temperature chemical processes for amorphous and polycrystalline thin films, particularly in the field of low temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD). Atomic layer deposition utilizes vapor phase precursors in a binary surface reaction scheme to build up inorganic thin films with monolayer precision in film thickness. Most ALD material applications, including for example commercial high dielectric constant insulators in semiconductor logic devices, require films in excess of ~2 nanometers to achieve functional performance. This work will emphasize ALD growth initiation on receptive low temperature substrates, and explore the ultimate minimum thickness limits for self-cohesive surface-releasable ALD thin films. Research will seek to understand surface reaction mechanisms and substrate interactions during ALD processes to produce viable nano-layered semiconductors that can be released from a substrate and suspended in solution. The PI will also explore the fundamental properties of these materials in comparison with similar known materials formed by layered structure exfoliation, and examine how the new methods and materials can be used for beneficial impact. A particular application focus will be on anisotropic materials for photoelectrochemical water dissociation. <br/><br/>This project will build on previous work, and the work on suspended nanosheets will initiate new research in a field that is not currently explored in the ALD or thin film deposition research community. There are several specific challenges, including designing ALD integration schemes and processes for self-cohesive ultrathin materials. The area of exfoliated nanosheets is sufficiently new, and the possible outcomes are sufficiently broad that the fundamental knowledge gained in this study will impact and expand the field of engineering of thin film deposition reactions. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>The project will promote teaching by allowing senior graduate students to mentor BS and more junior PhD students working in the lab. The PI plans to broaden participation by continuing to recruit students from underrepresented groups. The new research will enhance knowledge and research infrastructure in solar photoelectrochemistry, which is a growing area of interest at NC State and in the Research Triangle region in general. Results will be broadly disseminated by the students and PI in peer-reviewed journals and research conferences. The possible outcome of this work in new material processing schemes for economical solar-driven water electrolysis could provide significant beneficial impact to society in terms of energy and environment. The plans to advance basic understanding of ultra-thin film deposition will also impact a wide variety of fields, including advanced electronics, sensor technologies and other energy systems.

They control diverse metabolic functions including amino acid biosynthesis, virulence, nitrate fixation, replication, and many other major processes. Despite their central role in allowing bacteria to respond to their environment, LTTRs are among the least studied types of regulators. The goal of this project is to expand our understanding of how these proteins function at an atomic level. Questions that will be addressed include: how do LTTRs bind to specific sequences of DNA in response to specific control molecules and what conformational changes take place when they bind their control molecules? New approaches to study LTTRs will be developed so that understanding these proteins and their potential beneficial applications can be advanced in the scientific community. The combined labs of the two PIs will focus on two proteins (BenM and CatM) from a soil bacterium, Acinetobacter baylyi. A wide range of methods will be used including mutant screens (genetics), DNA footprinting (molecular biology), and biochemical methods like tryptophan fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, and X-ray crystallography. The research will allow models to be developed to explain how diverse LTTRs function. Application of these studies may lead to novel biosensors and/or improved organisms for bioprocessing and bioremediation that can come from being able to modulate their functions. The research environment has a high educational impact. The project will allow high school, undergraduate and graduate students to have opportunities to experience experimental science and learn advanced methods in a highly collaborative environment that crosses multiple disciplines.

The summit eruption has been much more explosive, and preliminary analyses show that the magma is more silicic in composition. This RAPID is to investigate several important aspects of the eruption during the next twelve months that will results in better knowledge and methodologies for interpreting ancient glaciovolcanic deposits, and also better prepare society for future glaciovolcanic eruptions from Iceland or from western North America.<br/><br/>This is the first documented glaciovolcanic eruption of trachyandesite and alkaline basalt in at least the past two hundred years, and represents a unique opportunity to improve our knowledge of glaciovolcanic eruption processes, which have become critical paleo-climate proxies for linking Pleistocene oceanic and continental climate signals. It is proposed to investigate several important aspects of the eruption during the next twelve months, including (1) textures of lavas now interaction at Fimmvˆrthuh·ls, (2) changes in fragmentation processes as documented in stratigraphically constrained samples of ash at proximal and distal locations from the volcano, and (3) changes in magma chemistry during the course of the eruption. In order to obtain the best samples for this work, it is critical to investigate high elevation lava-snow contacts and collect ash samples before deposits are either hydrothermally altered/palagonitized near the vent; reworked by secondary slope transport that will destroy stratigraphic/temporal information; eroded by seasonal rain; or covered by snow/ice during winter 2010-2011. The proposed research will enable the PI and one Dickinson College undergraduate to partner and collaborate with several Icelandic scientists (e.g., Steinunn Hauksdˆttir, Birgir Oskarsson) in the pursuit of the research goals.

The Summer Undergraduate Research Focus (SURF) investigates climate change and global warming effects on the aquatic environment and surrounding landmasses. Topics of investigation include coral bleaching, ocean acidification, decreased populations of aquatic species, aquatic diseases, harmful algal blooms, invasive species, remediation efforts and the health of bays and estuaries. Program participants (SURFers) engage in hands-on research, are mentored by faculty and peers, and receive training in ethics and professional skills. These elements generate an interest in science and an enthusiasm for scientific discovery, as well as provide role models and build self-confidence. Recruitment methods include personal contact with faculty members and posting on national listservs and the NSF REU website. Selection criteria include evaluation of the student's application essay, letter of recommendation, career plans, science courses taken and GPA. SURF encourages applications from minority students and students at primarily undergraduate institutions. Students are contacted at least twice annually to track their progress; they are also encouraged to join the SURF Facebook page. In addition to these tracking methods, three surveys are conducted during the summer. A common assessment tool is also used. Following a one-week orientation, the standard week includes four days of laboratory/field research and one day of group Research Ethics and Professionalisms activities. SURFers are introduced to the responsible conduct of research, scientific ethics, careers in science and professional skills, such as poster preparation, oral presentations, writing professional resumes and personal statements for graduate school. Each SURFer delivers an oral presentation on his/her research at our SURF Symposium.

These invariants can be extended to functors from the category of tangles to categories of quantum group representations. The invariant of a tangle is a homomorphism of representations. Link homology lifts quantum invariants one dimension up and can be viewed as functors from the category of link cobordisms to the category of multi-graded abelian groups. The invariant of a tangle becomes a functor between triangulated categories assigned to the boundaries of the tangle. Categorification leads to invariants of tangle cobordisms which take values in natural transformations between these functors. The categories that appear in this way categorify tensor products of quantum group representations and appear thoughout representation theory, symplectic topology, and algebraic geometry. The proposal aims to further elucidate the structure of link homology, discover new cohomological operations in them, further tie them up with Hochschild homology, generalize the Rassmussen invariant, and relate link homology with the categorification of quantum groups. Categorification of quantum groups, discovered less that two years ago, realizes them as Grothendieck groups of categories of projective modules over certain diagrammatically defined rings, which also appear throughout representation theory. The PI believes that categorified quantum groups will prove ubiquitous in several areas of mathematics and will continue studying them for the next few years.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mathematicians discovered in the past 30 years deep relations between the theory of knots and 3-manifolds (objects that locally look like our space but have a different global behaviour) and a plethora of sophisticated structures in algebra and geometry. Many of these structures have to do with the elucidation of the notion of symmetry. All symmetries of a given mathematical or physical object constitute what is known as a group - a collection of symmetries that can be composed and reversed. Various developments in the past decades led to a far-fetched generalizations of the notion of a group, including the discovery of quantum groups by Drinfeld and Jimbo. More recent further progress in the direction, in which the PI was involved, resulted in the discovery of so-called categorified quantum groups, which are even more sophisticated objects, from which quantum groups can be recovered by forgetting most of the information. These categorified quantum groups are expected to be intimately related to the topology in four dimensions. Four-dimensional topology studies objects that locally look like our space plus the time direction, but may have complicated global structure. This line of research is expected to further tie together many areas of mathematics, including representation theory, homological algebra, topology and geometry.

Madsen	12/31/2013	$177,316.00	Di Yang	hans_conrad@ncsu.edu	CAMPUS BOX 7514	RALEIGH	NC	276957514	9195152444	MPS	1774	7237, 9161, AMPP	$0.00	NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Ceramics are an important class of technological materials being used in insulators, fuel cells, gas turbines and various other electronic and structural components. However, the processing of ceramics is usually performed at high temperatures and slow rates. It was discovered that the application of a modest electric field enhances the processing rate, thereby reducing the required processing time or temperature. This offers the potential of significantly reducing the required energy and related cost. Thus, the use of an electric field provides a novel approach to the processing of materials. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the atomic mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effect of an electric field with the aim of optimizing the conditions. A major factor is the electronic space charge which exists in ceramic materials. A post-doctoral scholar and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be trained during the course of this project. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: It was discovered in prior work that the application of an electric field during the plastic deformation of the polycrystalline oxides MgO, Al2O3 and ZrO2(3Y-TZP) gave a significant reduction in flow stress. In the case of 3Y-TZP the reduction consisted of three components: one due to Joule heating, a rapid reversible component due to the direct effect of the field on the plastic deformation kinetics and an irreversible, cumulative component due to the effect of the field on the microstructure. These effects are attributed to ionic conduction, a reduction in the energy to form vacancies and a retardation of dynamic grain growth. In contrast to 3Y-TZP, MgO and Al2O3 did not exhibit the same three components. Theoretical considerations indicate that the three components are related to the space charge at the grain boundaries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to determine the physical mechanisms responsible for the reduction in flow stress in oxides which occurs with application of an electric field, with focus on the role of the valence of solute additions on: (a) the space charge at the grain boundaries and (b) the related grain boundary structure employing advanced high-resolution electron microscopy techniques. To obtain information on the time constants relating to the mechanisms, the influence of the electric field frequency is being investigated.

The emphasis on females will address the continuing low number of women in engineering fields, particularly in graduate education and the professoriate. LSAMP support and engagement will bring in intellectual and material resources to ensure success and bring the national conversation on engineering preparation into the program design and implementation. Students will gain foothold on their college degree program through the advising, strategies for success, tutoring and mentoring, as well as receive a stipend which will allow them to participate and benefit from the activities instead of working during the summer. Students will be exposed to research and career opportunities for a well rounded experience. The faculty have a clear and confident vision of the program. The one-on-one interaction between faculty and students; and other demonstrated experts in the broad scope of engineering fields is important to both faculty and students. <br/>Value added includes the tours of local engineering companies and the US Space and Rocket Center, which will provide access that the students would not otherwise have. The seminars, workshops, and required poster projects broaden the student experience well beyond coursework. The dissemination of lessons learned in the national LSAMP magazine will share the program with a national audience, expanding the potential impact.

The project includes establishing the feasibility of recovering contaminate free anode, cathode, and electrolyte materials. The recovery of those materials has the potential for cost reduction. The project includes characterization of the materials, as well as designing, building, and testing full cells incorporating the recycled materials.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be the direct use of recycled materials to build new cells. This has real potential for cost benefit. Success of the approach will greatly enhance the value proposition for recycling Li-ion cells, which should have a direct impact on the<br/>recycling rate. The low cost materials recovered and regenerated from recycled Li-ion cells have the potential to significantly reduce the cost of Li-ion systems overall, benefiting the consumer and enabling more rapid acceptance of environmentally friendly applications like EV?s. The Li-ion cells have applications (at this time) mainly in the automobile industry.

At dialysis centers, standard hemodialysis treatment, which utilizes massive amounts of highly purified water, results in a significant loss of nutrients. The objectives of this Phase I project are to design and test key units of an HD machine (HDM), to test the efficacy and safety of the system in vitro and to design a light weight (~22 kg) prototype home HD system equipped with high precision components for in vivo studies. Using minimum dialysate (<6L), the developed home HD system will achieve adequate toxin clearance with minimal ion and serum albumin loss, greatly improving the QOL of ESRD patients and their families by allowing for effective and comfortable treatment at home, work, or school or during travel.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes reducing the economic burden of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on patients and Federal healthcare programs. As the number of ESRD patients approaches 3 million globally, it is becoming critical to decrease the cost and resource burden of the chronic dialysis treatment of these patients by drastically decreasing facility costs, use of water and energy in treatment, and to increase patients' quality of life by facilitating greater flexibility in length and place of treatment. The proposed semi-portable hemodialysis machine offers many advantages over currently available dialysis systems. The advantages are based on both the highly efficient dialysis regeneration capability and the light-weight, precisely configured and controlled machine. The savings in raw water costs alone from use of this HD system would be significant. The savings could be even greater in other parts of the world where water costs are significantly higher (i.e. Germany, Great Britain, etc.) and where access to clean water is becoming increasingly difficult (i.e. China, India, Mexico, etc.). The system will enhance the scientific and technical knowledge in the fields of dialysis and sorbent technologies.
1009571	The Explosion Geometry of Red Supergiant Stars	AST	STELLAR ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSC	07/01/2010	06/18/2010	Douglas Leonard	CA	San Diego State University Foundation	Standard Grant	James Neff	12/31/2015	$221,891.00		dleonard@mail.sdsu.edu	5250 Campanile Drive	San Diego	CA	921822190	6195945731	MPS	1215	0000, 1207, OTHR	$0.00	This project will explore the mechanisms responsible for supernova explosions of the Type II-P (plateau) type. These arise from isolated red supergiant stars with initial masses ranging from 8 to 16 times the mass of the Sun. Current data on a limited number of these events suggest that the mechanism produces strongly non-spherical explosions. Dr. Leonard will conduct new observations of polarized light from type II-P supernovae and will re-analyze data from earlier events. He and collaborators will also compare the data against theoretical models developed specifically for this type of supernova, with the goal of determining whether the explosion geometry of red supergiants is the same for all Type II-P events and to discover what that geometry is. The result will form a key discriminant for stellar explosion models at the lower end of the high-mass star sequence.<br/><br/>The project will involve training graduate and undergraduate students in the acquisition, analysis, and publication of scientific data. To provide light curve information critical to the success of the spectropolarimetry program, the PI will exploit the research capabilities of his department's newly upgraded Mount Laguna Observatory facility by initiating a student-led program of optical and near-infrared photometric studies of supernovae.
1048010	International Workshop on the Status and Participation of Women in STEM Disciplines and Careers	DRL	REAL	03/31/2010	09/07/2011	Lisa Frehill	DC	National Academy of Sciences	Standard Grant	carol stoel	05/31/2012	$147,178.00	Lisa Frehill, Catherine Didion	lfrehill@etcmd.com	500 FIFTH STREET NW	Washington	DC	200012721	2023342254	EHR	7625	9177, SMET	$0.00	The Association for Institutional Research will organize and conduct two three-day workshops, scheduled approximately one year apart, to review the existing international knowledge base and exemplary policies and programs designed to enhance the status and participation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and careers. In brief, the primary goals of the workshops are to: (1) systematically review relevant international research literatures to enhance understanding of the barriers and challenges to the full participation of all women in STEM disciplines and careers; and (2) identify reliable and credible data sources and data gaps in order to create a research agenda. Using international comparative data, the effects of the intersections of gender and race/ethnicity, commonalities and differences among women in STEM, and strategies, policies, and programs that are effective in enhancing women?s participation in STEM will be identified. <br/>Intellectual Merit: The project?s intellectual merit lies in its inclusive systematic approach using intensive and extensive reviews and analyses of the relevant international comparative research and evaluation literatures to catalyze interdisciplinary discussion, and serve as a basis for defining a strategic research agenda. A major component of the workshop will be a guided discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of extant research on policies, practices, and programs at the national, regional, and international levels that enhance women?s full participation in STEM careers. The workshop will identify critical gaps in the data and research literatures on women in STEM fields, and identify comparative data on international cultural and structural differences and commonalities to pinpoint issues and topics for further research on women in STEM fields that transcend national, political, and cultural boundaries. The ultimate goal is to design, implement, and evaluate effective programs and practices to broaden the participation of all women in STEM fields in the U.S. and abroad. Additional contributions include identifying collaborators and creating networks for future international collaborations. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project?s broader impact will be realized through the establishment of a repository for multi-national research and an agenda that will eventually result in a rich and competitive technical workforce that is strengthened by the broader participation of all women. The workshop will propose strategies to attract and retain more women across ability, race, and ethnic groups not only into the STEM workforce, but also into STEM leadership positions, thus contributing to achieving the broader goal of strengthening scientific, technical and economic capabilities. <br/><br/>Workshop outcomes are expected to include a report that: summarizes reviews of relevant literatures; identifies gaps in research, data collection, and evaluation; and outlines recommendations for establishing strategic research agendas. Findings from the report will be disseminated through a workshop website as well as through presentations at international scientific conferences and meetings and national workforce policy summits.

The main lines of current research are: (A) a systematic approach to the study of one-dimensional systems of conservation laws based on geometric properties of their eigen-frames; (B) employing vanishing viscosity approximations to obtain interaction estimates for conservation laws in several space dimensions; (C) radially symmetric solutions to systems of conservation laws, and in particular solutions to the compressible Euler system.<br/><br/>All of the projects are motivated by the need to provide rigorous statements about the properties of physical models that are used by scientists and engineers. The results assess the range of validity of various physical models and will be of use in delimiting and refining existing models. Particular emphasis is put on understanding solutions of complex, nonlinear equations that are used in simulations of e.g. high speed flight, traffic flow, <br/>combustion and detonations.

1043248	RAPID Collaborative Proposal: Spatially-explicit, High-resolution Mapping and Modeling to Quantify Hypoxia and Oil Effects on the Living Resources of the Northern Gulf of Mexico	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	08/01/2010	06/02/2010	Michael Roman	MD	University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences	Standard Grant	David L. Garrison	07/31/2012	$107,961.00	William Boicourt, James Pierson	roman@hpl.umces.edu	BOX 775	Cambridge	MD	216130775	4102212014	GEO	1650	0000, 4444, 5987, 7914, OTHR	$0.00	On April 22, 2010, the drill platform Deepwater Horizon sank in nearly 1,200 m of water in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Since this date various estimates of oil and added chemical dispersants have been released from the site with dispersion both at the surface and at depth. The transport of this oil and dispersants has been influenced by wind-driven currents over the shelf and by the Loop Current and its derivatives offshore. To date the exact amount and paths of movement of the Horizon spill remain speculative. Since 2003, with funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, this group of investigators has conducted 5 summer cruises in the northern Gulf of Mexico using high-resolution sampling to define the spatially explicit relationships the physical environment and pelagic zooplankton and fish. Thus, this research group has one of the most comprehensive, synoptic data sets on temperature, salinity, oxygen, phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish in the northern Gulf of Mexico for conditions prior to the oil leak.<br/><br/>The current RAPID award will allow this group to repeat their high-resolution mapping of hydrography, oxygen, plankton and fish in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The study will cover the previous survey region in the hypoxic zone west of the Mississippi Delta and the area east of the Mississippi where more oil transport from the spill is expected. The cruise will take place in the late summer period because the investigators have 5 years of baseline data during this season to compare the results. The measures of species diversity and abundance, biomass size spectrum, fish diets, fish growth rate potential and the results produced from their use of ecosystem models will be extremely useful to assess the possible effects of the oil spill on the living resources of the northern Gulf of Mexico. This group also will send scientists on the ORV Oceanus to conduct high resolution vertical zooplankton measurements and MOCNESS zooplankton tows at deeper stations and broader mapping surveys to extend our spatial coverage of the affected area. They will coordinate our zooplankton and fish measurements with other investigators assessing the biogeochemical and biological impacts of the BP oil spill. Data from previous NOAA studies will be deposited in the NSF Biological NSF Biological and Chemical Oceanographic Data Management facility. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Given the economic importance of the Gulf of Mexico commercial fisheries (about 20% of the U.S. total landings representing about $991 million) and recreational fishing (generating ~30% of the nation's saltwater fishing expenditures and supporting nearly 25% of the nation's recreational saltwater jobs), it is imperative that knowledge of the effects of the BP oil spill on the pelagic ecosystem be assessed. The Horn Point Laboratory and Oregon State University are part of the National Science Foundation Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (NSF-COSEE) and Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs. Where possible in this NSF RAPID response grant, we will involve REU undergraduate students and teachers in our proposed research program.

All three represent extremely active areas of current dynamical systems research. The format of the workshop is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and otherwise be engaged in the various conference activities.

The investigators have expertise in Social Informatics and Social Psychology, and together they will collect and analyze a large-scale collection of tweets (short messages broadcast using the Twitter social networking service) that reference the Haiti earthquake disaster. The emotional content of these tweets will be tracked over time in an automated fashion using an expanded version of the Profile of Mood States test previously developed by one of the PIs. The social networks connecting Twitter users will be traced from users' Friend of and Follower data which will enable the researchers to examine the bi-directional influence of social factors with emotional responses and prosocial behavior. This analysis of Twitter data (both tweet content and social networking data of Follower and Friends networks) will permit an analysis of the impact of emotions on donating or other forms of prosocial behavior, as well as the effect of donating on subsequent emotional states. Using Twitter data to address what represents longstanding theoretical issues in Social Psychology allows the researchers to avoid many of the limitations of laboratory-based studies that include generally short time duration, practical and ethical limitations on the use of high impact manipulations, and often a reliance on college undergraduates as participants.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work are two-fold. First, the proposed program of research will promote teaching, training, and learning, by training and mentoring undergraduate research assistants and graduate students. Second, the proposed research will address questions that can be applied more broadly, to understand why and how people donate or perform other prosocial behaviors, and to encourage them to do so more frequently. Knowing what emotional states tend to lead to donation, and how people respond to information about their friends or acquaintances donations will allow charitable organizations to construct more effective appeals.

Adverse weather conditions degrade the performance of the system, causing increased bit error rate (BER), packet loss and network delays, as well as decreased network throughput. The objective of this project is to design a hybrid optical/RF system that is resistive to degradations caused by poor optical channel condition due to atmospheric turbulence. Combinations of experimental research and theoretical modeling will be utilized to realize such a system. The research will include the design of an optical transceiver that will efficiently handle optical transmission using different wavelengths while maintaining a light-weight optical interface and consuming minimal power. The research will examine the use of proper wavelengths for data transmission to minimize the influence of weather and maximize range without increasing transmission power. Current optical channel estimation algorithms will be examined and suitable ones will be developed based on multi-frame averaging. Estimation will be carried out using available wavelengths. The hardware design and software algorithms for the most current methods of pointing, acquiring, and tracking (PAT) will be examined to support optical communication between mobile aerial vehicles and stationary vehicles fixed at pre-determined, known locations.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The direct impact of the proposed project is the development of a unique optical transceiver, which will implement multiple wavelengths. Results of the work would make free-space optics a viable option for various wireless applications. Hence, the demand for all-time connectivity that is currently satisfied through the use of RF technologies may shift toward using optical technologies. This could aid by curbing the rapid increase in RF noise level caused by the almost daily introduction of a number of various RF devices. Results of the work have airborne Internet and battlefield communication applications. Graduate students will be trained, and a major undergraduate training program is leveraged.

The first project furthers Behrstock, Bestvina and Clay's investigation of the asymptotics of intersection numbers for free groups and its implications to the dynamics of Out(F) on certain simplicial complexes analogous to the curve complex. The second project further develops Clay and Pettet's new construction of fully irreducible automorphisms. This has applications for the third project where Clay and Pettet will begin to explore the thin part of the Outer space with the asymmetric metric. The fourth project aims to show that nonvirtually abelian subgroups of Out(F) satisfy uniform-uniform'' exponential growth. The final project proposes to involve undergraduates in examining the structure of subcomplexes of the curve complex for a surface. Together with undergraduates, Clay will create a computer program for studying free groups that assembles several classical and established algorithms.<br/><br/>A graph is a collection of points connected by edges. Graphs with the same number of holes can be considered themselves as points in a space, called Outer space. The shape of this space is well-known, but its geometry is not. One surprising geometric feature that is known is that the space is asymmetric, meaning traveling between two points may take longer in one direction than the other. This notion is very natural to anyone who has hiked up a mountain. This project involves an analysis of the asymmetries of Outer space.

The project focuses on using the silica for Silica-Titania Composites but would also take into account markets that employ precipitated or gel silica which would have differing properties than the silica used in Silica-Titania Composites.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be the characterization of the carbon activation waste stream that allows for better understanding of how to reuse as much of the waste product as possible while opening a marketing avenue for the waste instead of paying for disposal of valuable material. There is significant demand for silica products in the United States. The targeted product lines would aim to eliminate various pollution hazards and thereby provide a benefit to society. The sustainable nature of the process would prevent the loss of valuable material to landfills. The characterization of the waste stream might also lead to other marketable material recovery in the future.

While impressive performance has been achieved on selected samples, large-scale technological development has been hindered by the structural inhomogeneity of as-synthesized carbon-based nanomaterials. In an effort to overcome this polydispersity problem, a technique called density gradient ultracentrifugation is employed to sort carbon-based nanomaterials by their physical and electronic structure. This project seeks to resolve the outstanding issues surrounding the preparation, characterization, and application of monodisperse carbon-based nanomaterials. Specific research objectives include: (1) Tuning co-surfactant ratio and loading to achieve monodisperse small diameter (< 1 nm) SWNTs due to their spectral advantages for near-infrared optoelectronic applications. (2) Demonstrating diameter and electronic type sorting of DWNTs in an effort to elucidate exciton energy transfer between concentric carbon nanotube shells. (3) Quantifying structure-density relationship for surfactant dispersed graphene as a function of surfactant type, co-surfactant ratio, density gradient, and pH. (4) Employing monodisperse carbon-based nanomaterials in electronic device and materials applications such as transistors, optoelectronics, transparent conductors, and sensors.<br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. It is anticipated that this research will lead to substantial intellectual property and commercialization opportunities. Furthermore, an important component of the project is an education and outreach plan that is well integrated with the aforementioned research objectives including: (1) Undergraduate curriculum development through a revision and updating of an interdisciplinary course entitled Nanomaterials. (2) Hands-on, inquiry and design-based curriculum development for pre-college students in collaboration with the Materials World Modules program. (3) Engaging students and the general public about science and science policy via the Northwestern University Science Policy Action Network.
1014801	The Impact of Copyright Policy on Innovation in the Digital Era	SMA	Cyber-Human Systems (CHS), SCIENCE OF SCIENCE POLICY	06/15/2010	06/07/2010	Stephen Merrill	DC	National Academy of Sciences	Standard Grant	Joshua Rosenbloom	05/31/2012	$50,000.00		stephenamerrill@gmail.com	500 FIFTH STREET NW	Washington	DC	200012721	2023342254	SBE	7367, 7626		$0.00	This project synthesizes and advances understanding about the impacts of copyright policy in the digital environment, particularly on innovation. There is a particular focus on identifying what empirical studies could shed light on some of the most contentious issues in copyright policy. Copyright directly impacts a broader range of industries than patents -- publishing, recording, films, games, and software among others -- as well as virtually all activity on the Internet.<br/><br/>Four sets of outcomes are generated. The first is a set of commissioned papers on topics including a review of existing literature, an estimation and categorization of the scope of economic activity affected by copyright and its exception, a theoretical analysis of how copyright may stimulate or inhibit innovation, and at least one case study of the role of copyright and digital media in an industry undergoing disruptive change. The second is a public workshop on the topic of the impact of copyright policy on innovation. The third is the development of an online discussion forum. The final is a peer-reviewed report with recommendations for public and private funding agencies and institutions. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: In contrast to scholarship on some other elements of the innovation system, theoretical analysis of and empirical research on the impact of copyright policy has been very limited. Research in the area is urgently needed, since copyright policy affects a large and diverse range of economic activity. <br/><br/>It is critically important that we learn more, since the rules of copyright evolved for the most part in a pre-1990 era when the number of authors and publishers was small relative to the entire population, each instance of a creative work had a physical manifestation, the uses to which works could be put were known and relatively narrow, collaboration to produce a work generally required physical co-location or the repeated exchange of physical objects, and infringing copies were somewhat difficult to produce and distribute. As a result of the Internet, the number of authors approaches the size of the population, most works exist in non-physical form as a collection of bits, works can be readily excerpted, altered, and combined in limitless variety, reproduction and distribution are essentially cost-free, and collaboration can occur on a vast scale across differences of time and location.<br/><br/>The project stimulates such research by convening a community of interested scholars and potential funders to evaluate recent and ongoing work, identify policy relevant topics for future research, and explore the potential for developing new datasources, such as the creation of a new litigation database, and new methods. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts : The approach should stimulate the emergence of a multi-disciplinary community of scholars. A similar effort led to the growth of a community of patent scholars who are now very active participants in the patent reform debate. The result should be to create a better informed, more empirically and theoretically grounded, policymaking in the area of copyright law in the United States and globally.

The overall goals of this experimental program are threefold: i) to exploit high sensitivity direct absorption IR laser methods for study of jet-cooled radicals and fundamental molecular ions in slit supersonic discharges, ii) to augment these spectroscopic tools for quantum state-resolved collision studies at gas-ionic solution interfaces, and iii) to utilize time-resolved fluorescence microscopy methods for study of folding/unfolding kinetics at the single molecule level.<br/><br/>Highly reactive, very-short lived molecular species are important for many processes, ranging from atmospheric chemistry at the marine boundary to chemistry in the interstellar media. Additionally, this project involves using single molecular spectroscopy to study the kinetics of folding and unfolding of RNA molecules which is important to our understanding of many biological processes. A diverse group of individuals are involved the research including women and underrepresented minorities. The PI is also the Director of the CU Wizards Scientific Outreach program which organizes hands-on lecture/demonstrations for elementary and middle school students.
1005809	Investigation of the Oxidation of Stoichiometric and Carbon-Rich Tungsten Carbide Surfaces	DMR	CERAMICS	08/01/2010	06/17/2010	Petra Reinke	VA	University of Virginia Main Campus	Standard Grant	Lynnette D. Madsen	07/31/2015	$275,000.00		pr6e@virginia.edu	P.O. BOX 400195	CHARLOTTESVILLE	VA	229044195	4349244270	MPS	1774	7237, 7644, 9161	$0.00	NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Fuel cells are a cornerstone of future energy systems, and their functionality relies on the presence of a powerful and durable catalyst material. The majority of catalysts used in current fuel cell technology are based on costly noble metal materials. An alternative is the use of tungsten carbide, which is also compatible with novel microbial fuel cells. Unfortunately, carbide performance is hindered by surface oxidation. The current project aims to design carbon-rich, nano-structured carbide surfaces to remedy this critical issue. The investigation combines the synthesis and characterization of a set of novel carbon-rich carbide surfaces, and the observation with surface science analytical methods of the critical chemical reactions with oxygen and water. It is positioned at the intersection between fundamental and applied research, and has the potential to decisively broaden the range of effective catalyst materials. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Transition metal carbide surfaces such as tungsten carbide, are promising substitutes for noble metal catalysts in fuel cells, steam reforming and as a catalyst support. A critical limitation to their use is their susceptibility to oxidation, which modifies and depresses performance. The present study is based on the hypothesis that a carbon-rich, nanostructured carbide surface can be designed, where degradation through oxidation is minimized. A non-stoichiometric tungsten carbide is grown using a method that is closely related to molecular beam epitaxy, and the transformation of the surface during the reaction with water and oxygen is observed with a suite of complementary surface science techniques. This investigation connects surface characteristics to reactivity from the atomic to the mesoscale, and opens the pathway to the design of advanced tungsten carbide catalysts. The research is coupled with an educational component that engages the public and students at all levels. A particular focus is informal science education, which includes the design of a new exhibit, the Energy Corner, and a strong collaboration with NISE (Nanoscale Informal Science Education, http://www.nisenet.org/).
1010170	Metal-Catalyzed Diene and Olefin Polymerizations:  Mechanistic Studies and Catalyst Design	CHE	Chemical Catalysis	08/01/2010	05/26/2011	Maurice Brookhart	NC	University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill	Continuing grant	George Janini	07/31/2015	$561,000.00		mbrookhart@unc.edu	104 AIRPORT DR STE 2200	CHAPEL HILL	NC	275991350	9199663411	MPS	6884	1401, 7969, 9146	$0.00	The Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of Professor Maurice S. Brookhart of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill focused on the design and mechanistic studies of metal-catalyzed diene and olefin polymerizations. The copolymerization of ethylene and polar vinyl monomers is under investigation. These reactions provide high molecular weight materials at high rates by employing bulky monodentate ligands that circumvent catalyst deactivation. The second effort examines the development of late metal catalysts for the polymerization of norbornene and functionalized norbornenes. The molecular weights can be controlled and living polymerizations allow co- and block polymers to be made. The third aim centers on the development of a new family of well-defined diene and olefin polymerization catalysts based on cobalt, a late transition metal that has seen little development with respect to olefin polymerization reactions.  As a final part of the project, the activation of alkanes will be investigated.  Electrophilic activation of alkanes is thought to proceed through alkane complexes as intermediates.  As part of this work, Professor Brookhart focuses on synthesizing stable complexes of methane and higher alkanes and exploring their structures, dynamics, and reactivities with the aim of providing fundamental information useful in developing alkane functionalization reactions.<br/><br/>Polyolefins, polydienes and related copolymers such as those produced here are central to the polymer industry and are produced on a staggering scale of over 180 billion pounds per year due to the attractive physical properties of the polymers and elastomers and the ready availability of their starting materials. The reactions in this study investigate new (cheaper) metal catalysts that provide faster rates and fewer unwanted by-products.  Alkane functionalization (the final aim of the project) is a critical reaction for alternative energy production.  These reactions allow methane, a gas, to be converted to methanol, a liquid fuel that is easier to store, transport, and handle. <br/><br/>Professor Brookhart has made a serious commitment to mentoring minority students working with Project SEED and UNC-sponsored programs such as the Saturday Academy. The group contributes to the development of science programs at the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center, specifically Today's Chemistry, Tomorrow's Fuels. Several patents have been issued based on this work and the technology has been licensed by DuPont.

Poe Rd.	Bowling Green	OH	434030230	4193722481	MPS	1775	7237, 9161, AMPP	$0.00	Technical: The goal of this project is greater fundamental understanding of synthesis/processing and relationships between structure and photonic properties of self-assembled organometallic materials that allow for observation of both singlet and triplet excitons. The approach involves synthesis and investigation of coordination materials consisting of a singlet donor, with extended conjugated oligomers, and triplet acceptors, such as Pt(II) porphyrins. Two types of emissive coordination materials will be synthesized. One type will comprise two singlet state emitters, bis(8- quinolinolate)(AcAc)AlIII and conjugated oligomers, and doped-blended triplet acceptor, while the second will be composed of the same building block with the acceptor incorporated in a 'photonic wire' bridge. Studies will be focused on understanding the optical and structural properties of these materials. Particular attention will be devoted to the role of energy transfer and triplet diffusion. High-triplet energy components will be used to make materials capable of harnessing higher-energy processes for sky-blue and green phosphorescence. Insight into balancing sky-blue (~490 nm), green and orange/red emission and exciton-balance optimization via triplet-triplet energy transfer is expected to aid in the design of materials suitable for OLEDs and particularly for OLED-based solid-state lighting. The materials will be designed to allow for rigorous investigation of exciton dynamics, both singlet and triplet as well as exciton diffusion, processes of high importance in many solid state devices. Depending on the material components and method of excitation/sensitization, three processes, singlet, triplet energy transfer, and exciton diffusion proceed on different timescales, allowing evaluation of the processes separately. <br/><br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. This project is aimed at investigating energy transfer and exciton diffusion processes that have a major impact on performance of organic electronic materials. The knowledge generated during the work on this project will enable a better understanding and design of materials that will be used in OLEDs, organic photovoltaics, thus contributing to the development of energy-efficient technologies. The project emphasizes integrated education and research in training of pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students through laboratory participation, complementary coursework, and outreach activities. The multidisciplinary character of the project provides a unique opportunity for education of undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs. This is also a goal of the associated state-funded Building Ohio Talent for a Sustainable Energy Future program aimed at STEM areas of renewable energy generation for Ohio undergraduates in chemistry and physics. This program also enables community college students to transfer to Bowling Green St. U. and receive B.S. education in STEM majors.

This process by which species become more different from a competitor is called character displacement. Character displacement is critical for explaining how different species can coexist in the same habitat and why even closely related species typically differ. Yet, we know remarkably little about how this process unfolds. The proposed research will fill this critical gap by conducting observations and experiments on natural populations of two species of frogs. This research could prove vital for understanding how living things develop, function, and change over time. Moreover, this work will help us to understand how an organism's environment, not just its genes, affects its development. <br/><br/>Such studies are essential for evaluating the origin and treatment of developmental diseases. This work will also contribute to educational outreach by training young scientists (including K-12 students) in interdisciplinary research, and will broaden access to science by actively recruiting students from underrepresented groups. Finally, because of numerous changes to their environment, many species are currently undergoing radical shifts in their geographical ranges and thereby encountering new competitors. This work could serve as a model for what might happen to biodiversity following such encounters.

This device will have aesthetic appeal and provide a nonpolluting supplement to energy produced by wind turbines and combustion of fossil fuels. Rugged plastic leaves containing piezoelectric Kynar inserts will generate pulses of electricity when flexed by wind. Electrical currents will be full-wave rectified by diode bridges at the base of each leaf and routed in parallel to a smart battery charger.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to produce energy from wind without the environmental concerns related to wind turbines. Currently, wind energy harvesting is accomplished with wind turbines that drive large electromagnetic generators. Turbines are mounted atop high towers often in rural districts in order to avoid turbulent airflow typical of populated areas, and also to meet threshold wind speed requirements. As wind-farms have spread, environmental concerns have been raised about their effects on wildlife, local wind patterns, and the health of nearby residents. This project will develop a new and transformational technology that exploits engineering solutions evolved by plants over the years that they have been interacting with wind.

This is a long standing open problem and is now especially relevant as Brendle-Schoen have shown that no exotic sphere admits a metric with positive complex sectional curvatures. As a separate specific project the PI also proposes to understand when quasi-Einstein and gradient soliton metrics are forced to be Einstein metrics. These questions go back to the earliest works on Einstein metrics, but have received new attention with Perel'man classification of certain gradient solitons in three dimensions. Understanding quasi-Einstein metrics is also important in general relativity as they occur as solutions to the Einstein field equations.<br/><br/>In general terms the PI wishes to investigate what types of geometries are possible on specific topological objects. Two objects such as a doughnut and a tea cup are geometrically very different but topologically similar. The goal is to find the nicest possible geometries for specific topological objects. This is of interest to mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists,medical scientists and many other people as it is becoming increasingly clear that our flat Euclidean picture is not always the correct or even nicest model to use.

The resultant membranes will be used for water purification and desalination, as well as other size- and property-dependent molecular separations. <br/><br/>The primary focus will be the use of a highly efficient, one-pot synthetic method for preparing large amount of macrocyclic building blocks that will then be used for engineering the membranes. The building blocks are macrocycles sharing a rigidified, cyclic backbone that contain a non-collapsible hydrophilic cavity of ~5-6 angstroms. Recent studies indicate that this class of macrocycles have a high propensity to associate into 1D tubular assemblies. Based on preliminary results, analogous macrocycles with side chains carrying polar terminal groups should self-assemble into nanoporous membranes. The alignment of the 1D tubular assemblies in the capillary pores of anodic alumina membranes will be probed. Computer simulation will be performed to investigate transport (nanofluidic) behavior of water within the nanopore under different external pressures and to evaluate the permeability of the membrane to various ionic species in a solvent as a function of size of nanopores. Optimally designed membranes are expected to reject most small molecules and ions and will be assessed as nanofiltration membranes for water desalination. <br/><br/>The proposed research is highly interdisciplinary. Graduate and undergraduate students of various backgrounds will gain skills in multiple fields involving chemistry, materials science and the engineering of corresponding molecules and devices. Specifically, the educational impacts of this joint research include: (1) The unique opportunity to combine computer-aided design, synthesis, and characterization of molecular, supramolecular, and nanosized structures with the engineering of the corresponding materials and devices in the training of graduate students. (2) The program will involve undergraduate students, particularly those from groups traditionally underrepresented in sciences and students, who have limited exposure and access to the latest developments in the corresponding fields. (3) The research results will not only be published in highly visible journals to broadly disseminate this work to scientific society at large, but more importantly, will lead to many practical applications. Insights obtained from the construction of nanosized building blocks and the assessment of their 1D assembly will in turn will help the development of concepts generally useful for addressing other problems in the field of chemical and biological separation.

To promote this learning, a conference is being held where researchers and students will share information about world resources of specimens and data, especially those that are not well publicized. Investigators will exhibit the latest in technology for learning about brains and related behaviors, along with novel and often surprising findings, obtained using new techniques including brain scans, analyses of gene structure and expression, intracellular and intercellular transport of markers and physiologically active molecules, studies of fossils, electrophysiological probes, programmed observing and recording individual and social behaviors in wild natural surroundings, and digital capture and dissemination of images and numerical information. <br/> This opportunity for personal interactions among generations of workers, including new students and established authorities, will have lasting benefits for the work of all of them. The impact will be further spread by the publication of the Conference Proceedings in an established archival publication, the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, available in most of the major libraries of the world as well as on the Internet. The Conference Proceedings will be a major reference source for students, scientists, schools, industry, and public knowledge, for information about, and new means of studying, the relationships among the specializations of brains, bodily structures, and behaviors that enable, not only survival in particular environments, but, increasingly, the managing of environments themselves through the behaviors of their animal and human inhabitants.

He intends to do this by applying techniques from descriptive set theory and geometric measure theory in addition to the model-theoretic and analytic-geometric techniques usually associated with o-minimality. In turn, Miller hopes to apply model-theoretic techniques to obtain results in control theory (specifically, classifying expansions of structures on the real field by trajectories of definable vector fields), descriptive set theory, and geometric measure theory.<br/><br/>Many results of classical mathematics are very general: They apply to a wide range of input, so to speak, and thus tend to produce a wide range of output. But one could hope that if the input is particularly well behaved in some respect, then the output would be similarly well behaved. This turns out to be true in many important cases, but usually requires new, more constructive, proofs of classical results, as well as a deeper understanding of which inputs should be regarded as well behaved. The theory of o-minimal structures on the real field, a sub-discipline of mathematical logic, has been developed in large part to deal with this issue. This has been a rapidly-developing area for the last twenty-five years, with many contributions from, and cooperation between, researchers from several branches of mathematics and logic. Applications have been found in areas as diverse as theoretical economics, neural-net learning theory, and hybrid control systems, as well as in pure mathematics. <br/>However, o-minimality has a drawback: It allows only for the modelling of locally finitely connected behavior, and thus has rather limited use in understanding noisy or oscillatory settings. Miller proposes to develop extensions of o-minimality that can deal with at least some of these non-o-minimal phenomena.
1034623	NSF-EAGER: Is Ferromagnetism an Intrinsic or Induced Property of Gold Nanoparticles?

Recent reports of ferromagnetism in gold nanoparticles are quite surprising since Au has completely filled 5d orbitals. Various explanations have been advanced to explain the unusual magnetic characteristics of nanostructured Au particles, but considerable controversy remains to this date regarding whether ferromagnetism is intrinsic or somehow related to the medium in which the particles are supported. In this effort, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) will be used to achieve dispersed Au nanoparticles with tight control of size and shape. PLD of Au in nonmagnetic oxide thin films (MgO, Al2O3, and ITO) is expected to provide simultaneous synthesis and in-situ passivation of the nanoparticles, while preventing agglomeration. The proposed experimental approach is expected to enable the synthesis of pristine Au nanoparticles for various characterization and physical property measurements. A thorough understanding of the origin of ferromagnetic behavior, if it truly exists in Au nanoparticles, is the expected outcome and will serve as a catalyst for the development of new theories to explain this surprising phenomenon.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY. The discovery that ferromagnetism is an intrinsic property of Au nanoparticles will be transformative, if confirmed, in the sense that is will revolutionize the current understanding of the physics of nanomagnetic materials. Ferromagnetism in Au nanoparticles, coupled with their already established unique optical properties, may have an enormous industrial impact, from data storage to biomedical applications. One graduate student will contribute to this research. Additionally, summer students will be participants in the outreach program, Success Through Enthusiasm and Awareness of Materials Engineering Research (Project STEAMER) at VPI.

The project is targeting two distinct architectures, a conventional quad-core microprocessor and a graphics processing unit (GPU) with 240 cores, as well as a heterogeneous system that combines both. The technology represents a significant departure from the organization of contemporary compilers, automating as much of optimization as possible, but opening up the mapping process to provide savvy programmers the control they so often desire. The unique features of the system include: (1) transformation recipes as a programmer's or high-level compiler's interface to optimization and code generation; (2) a polyhedral framework to mathematically represent code structures and optimizations for robust code generation; and (3) auto-tuning technology to compactly describe and systematically evaluate a range of possibleimplementations of a computation. The most novel of these is the is the transformation recipe, which factors out the commonality of OpenMP, CUDA and OpenCL code generation, thus supporting the heterogeneous platform and facilitating late-binding decisions of which implementation to use. The software system from previous work is being released, and has accelerated both libraries and scientific applications. With the right transformation recipe for the auto-tuning system to evaluate, the resulting automatically-generated code yields high performance, in some cases competitive or even better than manually-coded implementations. The PIs plan to expand this capability to a broader set of applications and architectural features.

The first goal of the project is to construct a hyperbolic counterexample to the Rank Conjecture. The second part of the proposed research is to use branched surfaces and laminations to study Dehn surgery on knots and links in reducible 3-manifolds. One goal is to prove a major part of the Cabling Conjecture. The third part of the project is to study various aspects of Heegaard splitting. There are many interesting connections between the proposed research and several active programs of other researchers. The PI plans to explore these connections and develop new tools to achieve these goals.<br/><br/>Three-manifolds are objects modeled on the 3-dimensional space that we are living in. A donut and the spatial universe are both examples of 3-manifolds. These objects arise naturally in many contexts in physical and other natural sciences and model many interesting phenomena. A geometric way of studying 3-manifolds is to cut a complicated 3-manifold into a collection of simpler 3-dimensional pieces along 2-dimensional surfaces. For example a Heegaard splitting is such a decomposition. Using this idea, one can also construct useful new 3-manifolds by doing surgery on well-understood ones. The PI plans to study 3-manifolds using Heegaard splitting and surgery. The research targets several central questions in low-dimensional topology and knot theory, which has potential impact on other areas of scientific investigations, such as the topological structures of DNA.

The workshop participants are discussing and developing consensus about whether and how data-driven modeling and visualization approaches can best be used to improve hydrology education. Specifically, workshop participants are 1) identifying specific needs for cross-cutting data, modeling, and visualization digital resources that are valuable to the broader hydrology education community, 2) developing a strategy about how to bridge the gap between data-driven applications needed in upper division courses and those required in more general courses, 3) identifying key design criteria for a community cyberinfrastructure by which instructors can discover, download, publish, interconnect, modify, review, and collaboratively develop curriculum materials for data-driven cyberlearning related to hydrology, and 4) identifying the best ways to engage the larger community in the effective use of data-driven curricular materials and achieve broad dissemination, adoption, and use.<br/><br/>The workshop is producing a report that serves as a starting point to build a larger community wide effort to harness the available research and teaching resources for developing and using geoinformatics modules in hydrology education. In addition, the report also identifies the shortcomings of existing resources, and identifies opportunities for future research and development activities to improve hydrology education.
1007168	Algebraic structures in perturbative quantum field theory	DMS	TOPOLOGY	09/01/2010	07/18/2012	Kevin Costello	IL	Northwestern University	Continuing grant	Christopher W.

Costello<br/><br/>The proposed research is concerned with a new approach to perturbative quantum field theory, based on the concept of a actorization algebra. Factorization algebras are rich algebraic objects which simultaneously generalize the notion of E-n algebra and that of chiral algebra. The aim of this proposal is to show that the techniques of perturbative renormalization allow one to construct factorization algebras starting from a Lagrangian defining a physical system. Several applications of this approach to quantum field theory are also being proposed, including one related to elliptic cohomology and the Witten genus.<br/><br/>Quantum field theory is a fundamental tool in theoretical hysics, and underpins physicists current understanding of the behaviour of elementary particles. Quantum field theory has additionally had a great influence on the development of mathematics. The aim of this research proposal is to provide mathematical foundations for quantum field theory, and to apply these foundations to problems in geometry related to physics.

The second project in this research<br/>program is dedicated to an interaction of integrable systems with<br/>symplectic field theory of a compact Kaehler manifold Y,<br/>developing a potential related to the total descendant potential<br/>described above. Relationships are expected to emerge between<br/>Gromov-Witten invariants for Y and for a projective line bundle<br/>over Y, with the relationships described via transformations of<br/>integrable systems.<br/><br/>Symplectic geometry is the structure underlying the Hamiltonian<br/>formalism of classical mechanics, in which the behavior of a<br/>mechanical system is determined by an energy-like function.<br/>Geometric spaces carrying such structures can be high-dimensional<br/>and structurally complicated, and much recent work in the area is<br/>devoted to exploring symplectic structures through associated<br/>spaces of well-imbedded two-dimensional subsurfaces of them.<br/>Two-dimensional surfaces have been studied for more than 150<br/>years and our detailed understanding of them leads to constraints<br/>upon the associated invariants of high-dimensional symplectic<br/>manifolds.

He will continue his work on fast conformal mapping algorithms, including the class of Schwarz-Christoffel iterations. These include Davis' method and the CRDT algorithm of Driscoll and Vavasis as special cases, and other methods involving the medial axis and quasiconformal mappings. One of the basic themes is to start with certain quasiconformal maps that approximate the desired conformal map, but are easier to compute and have better properties. These maps have natural connections to several well known problems such as Brennan's conjecture, and the PI will investigate these connections. The PI will also continue his work on various related problems involving optimal meshing algorithms, diffusion limited aggregation, the geometry of Brownian motion, the quasiconformal Jacobian problem and conformal welding.<br/><br/>A fundamental problem of mathematics and engineering is to quickly and accurately solve various differential equations related to fluid flow, heat conduction and wave propagation on complex regions. For 2-dimensional surfaces, a standard method is to use a conformal mapping (i.e., angle preserving on small scales) to replace the region with a simpler one, such as a disk or rectangle. This approach has been studied for over 150 years, but not until the 1980's did computers made conformal mapping practical for highly complex regions. The PI will investigate how to improve existing methods and develop new ones that are faster and more reliable. He will also investigate the theoretical behavior of conformal maps on extremely complex domains such as fractals and the connections between conformal maps and probability theory. The PI has already applied the insights gained from these problems to meshing. This is the process of dividing a complex region into simple pieces such as triangles. Meshing is a basic part of most numerical methods and the usefulness of a mesh in applications depends on the number of pieces (fewer is better) and their shapes (better to avoid small and large angles). It is difficult to construct a mesh which is good in both respects, but PI has used non-Euclidean geometry to construct 2-dimensional quadrilateral meshes with optimal size and shapes for simple polygons and is working to extend this to more general domains. Greater generality is needed in various problems involving crack formation, interfaces between materials and computer learning. Efficient meshing also has numerous applications in high-performance computing such as modeling surfaces for engineering and computer graphics. This award is jointly funded by the programs in Analysis and Geometric Analysis.

Current commercial devices, based on carbon electrodes, have low energy density, ~ 5Wh/kg, which limits their commercial potential. The objective of the research is the development of composite electrodes that incorporate nano-scale oxides with significant electrochemical capacitance, and structural robustness. Various fabrication routes will be explored, with the aim of maximizing charge transport and transfer between the different species that form the structure. Electron microscope imaging will be combined with the measurement of the electrochemical capacitance and electrical resistance in order to understand structure-property relations underlying electrochemical energy storage in composite materials. Devices that incorporate the electrodes will also be fabricated and tested. If successful, the project will demonstrate a supercapacitor device with energy density of 25Wh/kg, exceeding that of current devices by a factor of 5. In addition to higher power, longer lifetime is also expected. Other anticipated outcomes are a better understanding of nanoscale metal oxide materials and the interplay between different functional materials, and a demonstration of the technological potential of asymmetric supercapacitors.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of this project, if successful, is that supercapacitors with several fold improvement over currently available commercial devices, will find their role in many applications and particularly in transportation. The advent of hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology signals a clear shift towards vehicles, both large and small, that need to be energy efficient while also maintaining full functionality. First generation high energy density devices have applications in light electric vehicle applications (electric bicycles and carts), as to provide a more optimal energy source or to provide power assistance. Succeeding generations of these devices would replace conventional batteries in larger scale cars and trucks. These devices would enable the move towards a greener, more energy efficient transportation system, one that would result in lower pollution and less strain on the nation's energy demands.

Critical to this research is use of atomic layer deposition to control the material growth at atomic resolutions to achieve ultrathin conformal copper sulfide-based semiconducting films that follow the contours of nanostructured oxides, and a suite of characterization tools to understand the mechanisms for film growth and resulting materials properties. The industrial partner, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., provides custom metal organic precursors, which enable unprecedented control over material stoichiometry and phase, a major issue with previous attempts to utilize Cu-based materials for solar energy conversion. The ability of the atomic layer deposition precursors to conformally coat the mesoporous nanoparticle and nanowire templates as a function of material processing conditions is studied using high resolution electron microscopy and optical studies. Focus is placed on understanding and controlling the material phase and homogeneity, trap state density, structural defects, and electronic structure as evaluated by X-ray synchrotron measurements, photothermal deflection spectroscopy, and the transport properties of materials and devices.<br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. It contributes to the development of semiconductor materials based on abundant, non-toxic elements that could be used for solar energy conversion. The PIs plan to expand their successful track record of training underrepresented physics students through collaborations with local Hispanic-serving community colleges and organizations. Much of this work is performed at the UCSC Advanced Studies Laboratory, providing students exposure to both NASA and industrial collaborators.

The proposed concept will potentially improve the scalability, reliability, and versatility of two-phase micro/mini-channel heat sinks by addressing two key issues: parallel channel instabilities and transient dryout of channels experiencing vapor explosion. The specific feature in the proposed concept is a porous layer lining the heat sink walls. The porous layer provides more uniform nucleation during flow boiling and also stores liquid for evaporation during the bubble venting period, resulting in improved temperature uniformity and reduced flow and temperature oscillations. There are three objectives for the Phase I project: (1) develop a model to select the most favorable porous layer and heat sink geometries; (2) optimize the techniques for porous layer manufacturing and characterization; and (3) build and test microchannel heat sinks with porous layers to demonstrate their performances. The Phase II project will develop the advanced two-phase micro/mini-channel heat sinks for specific commercial and military applications for these partners.<br/><br/>Broader Impact of the Proposed Work and Commercialization Potential<br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will contribute to better understanding of two-phase micro/mini-channel instabilities and develop effective means to suppress them. The results of the project will improve micro/mini-channel heat sink usefulness and robustness for diverse operating conditions. This is a critical step towards commercialization of two-phase micro/mini-channel heat sinks. Mobile internet, assistive technologies, and other electronics technologies with market sectors in chip manufacturing, aging population, and transportation could benefit from the proposed technology. It was predicted that the total annual electricity savings in the U.S. alone could reach $1B if advanced chip level (liquid, two-phase, etc.) cooling solutions are implemented for computer data centers.

Granular flows are prevalent in a range of natural and industrial systems, yet a basic understanding of many phenomena is lacking. The Gordon conferences provide a unique forum for the exchange of fresh scientific ideas. The guiding principles of the conference include the presentation of new, unpublished work followed by free, unhampered discussion among participants from disciplines that normally do not intersect. Since this field stands at the intersection of many disciplines, this installment of the Gordon conference includes invited speakers and discussion leaders from a wide range of disciplines, including Engineering, Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, Chemistry and Earth Sciences. Representatives from industrial labs like Xerox, Schlumberger, ExxonMobil, and Dow Chemical will also be encouraged to attend. We will also solicit attendance from federally-funded research agencies such as NETL and NASA. In order to move beyond incremental research, cross-fertilization of participants is needed, which involves not only bringing these scientists together, but also providing an environment that promotes their interaction. The structure of the Gordon conference accomplishes this task by providing formal discussion periods after every talk, free time in the afternoons for small-group, follow-on discussions, poster sessions, and shared meals and on-site housing. The Gordon format will provide an environment in which new collaborations can be forged to help tackle longstanding problems.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>The schedule has been prepared to ensure strong representational balance on several aspects:<br/>- Gender- 9 out of 31 invited speakers and discussion leaders are women<br/>- Discipline - The speakers are drawn from a wide range of affiliations, and institutional types.<br/>- Seniority - Several of the speakers are younger scientists.<br/>- Geography - A truly international set of scientists and engineers have been identified as speakers<br/>The financial support requested from NSF will allow us to fund emerging scientists (students, post-docs, and junior faculty) and under-represented groups to ensure a diverse audience is able to attend the meeting. Student and post-docs will be integrated into the meeting via contributions to the poster sessions. Younger scholars rarely have the opportunity to mingle with more established researchers from (i) a diversity of disciplines, (ii) in an environment where a large fraction of time is devoted to informal discussions. Furthermore, the programme has been prepared with a view to ensuring broad international representation. This exposure is invaluable in helping to address the national need for training of young U.S. researchers in the area of particle science.

In many of these wars, despite a Mao Tse-tung image of rebels winning hearts and minds, civilians pay the heaviest cost, with high levels of displacement, malnutrition, and disease. These indirect costs of war are ultimately more damaging than the fighting. <br/><br/>But there is significant variation in the relative costs paid by civilians and those paid by soldiers. For example, in Sri Lanka, the ratio of civilian to soldier deaths was 1:1; meanwhile in the Democratic Republic of Congo, that ratio was more than 100:1. This leads to the question of why some rebel groups create order in their territories, while others abuse and prey upon the civilian population. State-of-the-art answers to this question in political science focus mostly on how rebels get funded and on the strategic balance between rebels and state militias.<br/><br/>The dissertation proposes a new theory of rebel group behavior based on the internal dynamics of rebel organizations. It assumes that rebel leaders have an economic incentive to create order in their territories but are often unable to prevent group members from looting and abusing the civilian population. While earlier theories saw a positive relationship of resources and predatory behavior, this project's theory predicts that rebel leaders will exert more effective control over their subordinates when they have access to financial resources. A second factor predicting restraint on predatory behavior is that of close ethnic/social ties between leaders and their commanders. Finally, the project has identified a third factor so far ignored in the literature. The researcher finds that the goals of external patrons matter, and in cases of predatory behavior, there are incentives by foreign suppliers to support weak leaders who can be more easily manipulated, resulting in abusive, factionalized groups.<br/><br/>Applied to the civil war in Liberia, 1989-2003, this model predicts variation among Liberia's rebel groups, depending on the factors listed above. To test the model, the project uses a remote sensing methodology developed in the earth sciences. Satellite images are processed to measure changes in crop area as a proxy for civilian abuse during Liberia's war. These crop estimates are combined with systematic data on rebel group characteristics collected through 14 months of field work, as well as geographic and demographic data. Preliminary results indicate significant variation in crop area over time, consistent with the model's predictions. The model is further tested on an original, cross-national dataset of rebel groups, 1945-2003.<br/><br/>The study of civil war has been constrained by a lack of reliable, micro-level data. This dissertation develops a rigorous method for overcoming these limitations while also offering a theoretical contribution to the field. Through its emphasis on food security and intra-group bargaining, the dissertation provides concrete implications for designing humanitarian interventions and successful peace agreements.

This project will investigate the discovery of provably best data structures for several fundamental problems, including the dictionary and the priority queue. The dictionary supports the efficient insertion, deletion, and search of ordered data. The priority queue supports insertion and the removal of the minimum element.<br/><br/>Data structures will be designed and analyzed under the paradigm of instance-based optimality. In this model, a data structure's performance on a sequence of operations is evaluated based on how well it compares to the speed of the best structure for that sequence among a naturally-defined class of structures. The classes of structures that will be examined include binary search trees and heaps. Binary search trees and heaps are arguably the most fundamental nontrivial classes of data structures in computer science. Despite their origins at the dawn of computing, a complete understanding of these classes of structures has remained elusive to this day.<br/><br/>Other operations on fundamental data structures will be investigated. The ability to decrease the value of an item in a heap is vital to some algorithms, notably Dijkstra's algorithm for finding single-source shortest paths in a graph. Yet, it is not completely understood what types of structures can support this operation efficiently. Also, there is no known efficient method to support the splitting and merging of dictionaries; one goal of this project is to design a comparison-based dictionary do this in amortized logarithmic time.

Foss	06/30/2014	$524,000.00		chml@purdue.edu	Young Hall	West Lafayette	IN	479072114	7654941055	MPS	6883	1982, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	The Chemistry of Life Processes program supports Professor Jean Chmielewski at the Purdue University in developing cationic amphiphilic polyproline helices for penetrating selective cells. The passive uptake of genes, polypeptides, particles and, at times, small molecules into cells is prohibited due to their inability to adequately cross the membrane bilayer. The PI's group has designed a class of molecules, cationic amphiphilic polyproline helices (CAPHs), that have been shown to effectively cross the cell membrane and enter certain cells selectively. The goals of the proposed research seek to explore specific structural features within CAPHs that allow for efficient cell uptake using the tools of synthetic chemistry and membrane biochemistry (model and cellular), and to harness the remarkable cell penetrating characteristics of CAPHs for the delivery of cargo within the cell. With these goals in mind, the specific questions that will be addressed include: (1) What features of CAPHs may be modified to promote membrane penetration and specificity? (2) What is the mechanism used by CAPHs to interact with the lipid bilayer and to cross cellular membranes? (3) What small molecule fluorophores may be imported into cells through non-covalent association with oligomeric CAPHs?<br/><br/>The ability of highly cationic molecules to cross the hydrophobic cell membrane is unusually evocative and would have a broad impact on many areas of science, including nanotechnology, gene therapy, drug delivery, and basic membrane biochemistry. As the PI continues to advance the knowledge base of cationic amphiphile/membrane interactions, she will reach out to other scientific disciplines by writing comprehensive reviews of the area and will participate in more public forums to share results and perspectives with non-scientists. This area of research--combining chemistry and biology--also would have broad impact as the foundation for exposure to interdisciplinary aspects of science to younger students. With this in mind, the PI has developed an outreach program targeting high school students and their teachers. It is the goal of these outreach efforts that a significant group of Indiana high school students and teachers will learn to appreciate the overlap of modern scientific disciplines through true hands-on exposure.<br/><br/>These studies are directed at the development of shuttles with which molecules can enter cells. Ultimately this work will lead to a deeper understanding of how to bring therapies, diagnostic tools and probes into specific cells.
1045252	RAPID: Trophic interactions in floating Sargassum communities of the Gulf of Mexico: potential consequences of habitat degradation.	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	06/15/2010	06/09/2010	Sean Powers	AL	University of South Alabama	Standard Grant	David L. Garrison	05/31/2012	$157,664.00	Frank Hernandez	spowers@disl.org	307 University Boulevard	Mobile	AL	366880002	2514606333	GEO	1650	5987, 7914, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	Intellectual Merit: While an extensive literature exist of the acute affects of oil spills on marine communities in nearshore habitats, little is known about the potential responses of pelagic communities to such acute disturbances. One of the key habitats of the coastal and open oceans that will be affected by the ongoing Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill is floating Sargassum mats Sargassum natans and S. fluitans). The Gulf of Mexico region represents the second most productive Sargassum system in the world. The pelagic brown algae represent an oasis of structure in the open ocean that supports a large and diverse assemblage of marine fish and invertebrates. The loss and degradation of structurally complex brown algae (Fucus) in Prince William Sound, Alaska following the Exxon Valdez oil spill was responsible for a myriad of direct and indirect impacts on the foodweb, many of which persisted for years.<br/><br/>This RAPID project has four components designed to evaluate trophic interactions within this habitat at risk: 1) areal distribution of Sargassum in the north-central Gulf of Mexico; 2) ship-based neuston, ROV aand pelagic long-line surveys of the larval, juvenile and adult fish communities; 3) stable isotope analyses (C and N) of the food web and (4) mesocosm experiments to examine the role of Sargassum in modulating predator-prey interactions.<br/><br/>The Sargassum ecosystem is going to be significantly impacted and the need to increase our mechanistic understanding of the role Sargassum plays is important. Further, some systematic way to assess the potential consequences of changes in the distribution of the habitat will be a critical element of assessing the ecological response of the Gulf of Mexico to this disaster.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Episodic disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill provide an opportunity to train young scientists to be responsive and adaptive in their research careers as well as fulfill a critical service to the nation during assessment, mitigation and restoration activities. Marine education activities will be strengthened by exposing undergraduate and graduate students to the role of science in evaluating ecosystem resistance and resilience to disturbances. The project will directly involve graduate students and undergraduate interns, many of whom represent historically underrepresented groups. This RAPID project will also be highlighted in the education and outreach activities of Dauphin Island Sea Lab's Discovery Hall Program, which has an outstanding K-Gray program that educates over 5,000 students through its year long program, a public aquarium and the NSF sponsored COSEE Gulf of Mexico program. Outreach to historically underrepresented groups will be facilitated through membership of the University of South Alabama in the Alabama Alliance for Graduate Education and Professoriate. The attention the oil spill will bring to this project will greatly assist efforts in recruiting and teaching students who have an interest in environmental studies and their application to solving the pressing societal issues of the next generation.

The membrane can upgrade biogas at 40 to 65% CH4 to 90%+ CH4 with <10% CO2 at minimal/no pre-compression. Then, the upgraded methane can be used to generate pipeline quality methane, to produce peak time electrical power from on-site gas storage tanks for resale to the grid and/or to generate power or heat for in-house use. The resulting methane can be used on site, supplied via pipeline after being pressurized, or be feed to an on site electrical generating plant.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be first to reduce the release of the greenhouse gas methane, second to produce a stream of high quality natural gas at a theoretically lower cost than competing technologies.

1032343	Conference: Biological Consequences of Alternatively Structured DNA to be held in Steamboat Springs, CO on July 5th, 2010	MCB	Genetic Mechanisms	06/01/2010	06/23/2010	Susanna Lewis	MD	Federation of Amer Societies For Exper Biology	Standard Grant	Karen C.

However DNA can transiently assume a variety of other shapes that can have deleterious consequences for cells and organisms. Non-B form structures are provoked in largely unknown situations and due to their characteristic instability, are difficult to detect. In some cases, the destructive effects of an alternative DNA structure are suspected only after the fact, when a large-scale genomic change is observed. Barriers to the study of alternatively structured DNA in cells have been so impenetrable that to the present day we lack basic knowledge. Consequently the ways in which alternative DNA structures might influence the aging process or produce genetically inherited defects has attracted little experimental attention. This can be hard to appreciate because the analysis of alternative DNA structures in isolation (outside of a cell) is a well-developed field where creative applications in nano-engineering and medicine are being energetically pursued. The meeting unites researchers from diverse areas of science -such as physics, medicine and molecular biology- who share an interest in alternatively structured DNA. The Biological Impact of Alternatively Structured DNA conference thus provides a unique opportunity for synergism, bringing together the questions, methods, and applications of different disciplines to generate fundamental insights into the biology of non-B form DNA.<br/><br/>Biological Impact of Alternatively Structured DNA will take place over a five-day period starting on July 5th, 2010. The meeting was first held in 2008. Then as now, a major goal was to fulfill an educational role. The previous conference seemed to be effective in coalescing interest among scientists and was summarized in a high-profile journal. An increasing number of articles have appeared on the subject of non-B form DNA, and particularly its in vivo effects, which suggests that this topic is coming into its own, and the Conference is especially timely. Some long-standing technical problems are being tackled, and overlooked scientific questions are at long last beginning to be addressed. Significantly, evidence continues to accumulate of non-canonical DNA structures that are involved in human diseases. The 2010 meeting, by highlighting new insights and exciting research, will continue to demonstrate to the scientific community that there are interesting fundamental discoveries yet to be made in this area. Younger investigators have been encouraged to apply, and are impressed by the fact that an entire meeting is dedicated to the biological implications of non-B DNA structures. The conference will demonstrate to the interested early-career scientist that working on a neglected area of DNA metabolism is valid and that a commitment to this area of reasearch will be rewarding. Ultimately basic discoveries fostered by conferences such as this can translate into inventive strategies for diagnoses, amelioration and treatment of disease.

Currently, the high cost of the PEM fuel cell limits their commercial applications. A significant cost of a PEM fuel cell comes from the use of Platinum. This project intends to develop a low cost core shell nanostructured catalyst which has the advantages of high specific catalyst activity as well as controllable shape and size.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be reduced use of platinum in PEM fuel cells. This will lower their cost. Fuel cells have the potential to revolutionize the power generation methodology and offer cleaner and more efficient power. This project targets the automobile industry as potential customers. More new jobs could be created by establishing leadership in this emerging technology; and fuel cells also are beneficial to the environment.

Attempts to stabilize are attempts to normalize particular social relations and an analysis of these processes can be used to assess the priorities of those vying for power in the post-war context. In particular, an analysis of attempts to stabilize gender relations can be used to examine how gender identities are used to place some people in positions of power over others. Taking advantage of the transitional moment of resettlement in northern Uganda, this study examines the negotiation of power in processes of stabilization in the post-war landscape, the way gender is used within these negotiations, and the effect of these gendered processes of stabilization on people's lives. <br/><br/>This study asks how gender is constructed by the state, local organizations, and international agencies in Uganda to affirm their visions of stability. How do these visions vary by place, and how do their discursive and material manifestations affect people's lives? Finally, what role does the stabilization of specific social relations have on local strategies for realizing peace and equality? This research will apply feminist theory and critical development theory to the particularities of post-war landscapes in order to understand the shifts in authority, agency and violence that are associated with stabilization and reconstruction. This research will be conducted in collaboration with the National Association of Women's Organizations in Uganda (NAWOU). By using a qualitative methodology while working with NAWOU member organizations in Gulu, Pader and Kitgum districts, the study will be able to collect data on a highly transient population that has little trust in researchers. With the guidance of NAWOU, the findings of this study will be disseminated directly to local feminist organizations to contribute to their ongoing efforts for peace and equality in the region as well as national and international actors that are trying to create gender sensitive programming in the post-war landscape of northern Uganda.<br/><br/>This project contributes to feminist scholarship in multiple disciplines by investigating the theoretical disconnect between the investigation of the experiences of both men and women during a period of conflict and the experiences of those very same men and women in a post-war society as it undergoes the process of development. This project nests itself in the intersection of these two very important theoretical frameworks with the aim of not simply offering a better understanding of gender relations but a better understanding of how those gender relations are integral to sustainable peace. Furthermore, by using feminist geographic theory that critically engages with the concepts of place and scale, this research will connect global, national and local discourses with the on-the-ground material experiences of individuals to explore possibilities for peace. This project is jointly supported by the NSF Geography and Spatial Sciences Program and the NSF Africa, Near East, and South Asia Program (ANESA) of the Office of International Science and Engineering.

1014156	SBIR Phase I: A Resilient and Underactuated Robotic Hand Capable of Both Power and Precision Grasping	IIP	SMALL BUSINESS PHASE I	07/01/2010	06/01/2010	David Wilkinson	MA	Barrett Technology Inc	Standard Grant	Muralidharan S. Nair	12/31/2010	$150,000.00		dw@barrett.com	73 Chapel Street	Newton	MA	024581010	6172529000	ENG	5371	5371, 6840, 9139, HPCC	$0.00	This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a robotic grasper based on a novel torque switching mechanism, and a structurally compliant finger with embedded sensing. Robotic hands in industry tend to be fragile and lack the dexterity to perform a wide range of grasping and manipulation tasks. Robotic hands in academia tend to be more dexterous yet tend to be bulky, possessing large controller cabinets and/or forearms.<br/>Furthermore, when a collision occurs within a robotic workcell it is usually the hand (gripper) that makes impact. The proposed hand will have greater dexterity than a conventional gripper, being able to perform both power grasps and pinch grasps on large and small objects and yet be able to absorb and survive major collisions fully intact while alerting the robot system to move<br/>more cautiously. The Phase-I project objectives are: (1) create prototypes of an active torqueswitching mechanism; (2) create prototypes of a resilient polymer link with an embedded sensor; (3) build a prototype 2-fingered hand; (4) evaluate functionality of the prototype hand. Phase II will result in a compact, durable hand capable of grasping and manipulating a large range of<br/>objects.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is three-fold; there will be a general commercial impact, a direct commercial impact, and a societal impact. The general commercial impact addresses the shortcomings of metal gripper devices available today. These gripper devices discourage the use of robotic systems, thereby undermining manufacturing productivity.<br/>The proposed solution improves manufacturing competitiveness by enabling easier adoption of robotic work cells. The direct commercial impact is that local (US) workers will assemble, test, and ship these products. Ninety-five percent of the components will be sourced from US fabricators and OEM suppliers, boosting the US economy. Meanwhile, the company exports<br/>50% of its finished products to foreign markets. The societal impact stems from the idea that the risk of damage to an expensive robot discourages innovation and keeps the programming to a select few programming ?experts?. The proposed solution invites production line workers back into the process. Without the high cost of collisions, the worker (true expert) is encouraged to<br/>experiment and program process improvements. Corporations otherwise automate these workers out of their skilled jobs who then join the unemployed while the company literally loses touch with the ability to understand and innovate processes.

It will establish rigorous results about the average likelihood ratio statistic, which has recently been claimed on empirical grounds to be superior to the scan statistic. The investigator will derive guidelines for deciding when one is preferable to the other. The project will also examine how various approximation schemes affect the performance of the average likelihood ratio statistic in terms of power and computational complexity.<br/><br/>The problem of detecting spatial clusters or `hot spots' has received considerable attention in recent years, due to emerging important problems in various areas such as biosurveillance, the detection of radioactive materials, or the detection of illicit container shipments. Recent empirical findings suggest that the statistic that is commonly used for these purposes is suboptimal and can be improved upon by a different criterion. This project will perform a rigorous mathematical investigation of this empirical finding and will derive guidelines for deciding in which cases one methodology is preferrable to the other.

The high-index of refraction coating material to be used initially in Advanced LIGO is the main source of thermal noise. Past research to determined the source of excess loss in a low-index coating material allowed demonstration of how it may be reduced or eliminated. These studies of low-index material provided important indicators to guide the search for the necessary high-index coating but with low mechanical loss. LIGO scientists have studied and reduced the multitude of sources of noise that directly couple into the interferometer, thereby exposing indirect, bilinear noise processes, such as up-conversion of noise produced outside LIGO's band of sensitive frequencies into that band. Bicoherence provides a measure of such bilinear coupling while being insensitive to Gaussian noise. Development of a data monitor for bicoherence will continue under this award. Once identified, this noise can be monitored and if possible, eliminated. The bicoherence calculation engine could be adapted eventually to search for gravitational waves, since inspiral and burst signals both have nonzero bicoherence.<br/><br/>Advanced LIGO, which is scheduled to be fully operational by 2015, has been designed with a sensitivity to allow it to make regular observations of gravitational waves. Improvement in Advanced LIGO sensitivity through improved optical coatings and amelioration of up-conversion noise will allow achievement of the greatest discovery potential. The PI plans to involve several undergraduates in his research. This matches well with Hobart and William Smith 9HWS0 Colleges' ongoing effort to expand their science program. The opportunity to work in research programs like LIGO at HWS is helping to increase the number of physics majors and to change their attitude about a career in physics.
1006272	Complex Oscillations and Invariant Manifolds	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS, DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS	07/01/2010	08/26/2013	John Guckenheimer	NY	Cornell University	Continuing grant	Lora Billings	06/30/2016	$546,721.00		jmg16@cornell.edu	373 Pine Tree Road	Ithaca	NY	148502820	6072555014	MPS	1266, 7478		$0.00	This project studies the mathematical theory of dynamical systems with multiple time scales and develops new computational methods for bringing this theory to bear upon models of biological phenomena. The research employs geometric approaches to study these problems. In particular, it investigates invariant manifolds that play a key role in organizing complex oscillations. New computational methods for computing these manifolds are one focus of the research. Indeed, there is a general lack of methods for computer investigation of manifolds. Creation of a comprehensive ``smooth computational geometry'' is a long term goal of the research. The project also seeks to develop methods for fitting models to data. It is rare that all of the parameters of a complex dynamical model can be measured or that systematic methods are used to estimate these parameters from empirical time series data. With multiple time scale systems, this is a particularly difficult optimization problem because abrupt changes in the dynamics are not readily fit by the quadratic models upon which smooth optimization algorithms are based. This project seeks to identify where these abrupt changes occur. The methods also enable accurate sensitivity analysis that describes the rates of change of model trajectories as parameters are varied. They are designed to contribute to the toolkit of methods available for designing engineered systems with periodic operating states rather than ones which are steady.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems theory is astonishingly successful in relating widely disparate phenomena observed in population dynamics, chemical reactions, lasers and much more. This project follows this tradition, seeking to explain universal dynamical behaviors observed in rhythmic processes, many of which display complex oscillations.  Respiration, the heartbeat, circadian rhythms, menstrual cycles and animal locomotion are a few examples of biological rhythms to which the methods apply. All the primary modes of locomotion of higher animals: walking, running, slithering, swimming and flying result from cyclic motions of the body. Bursting oscillations that are ubiquitous in the nervous system exemplify temporal complexity: epochs of active firing of neurons alternate with quiescent periods. In mixed mode oscillations of non-equilibrium chemical reactors, epochs of large and small amplitude oscillations alternate. Multiple time scales are inherent in these complex oscillations. Thus, this project develops new methods for the analysis of dynamical systems with multiple time scales and the results yield a deeper mathematical understanding of how rapid changes in a system can result from variations of slow components. Geometric models reduce the mechanisms for such changes to their simplest forms and provide mathematical explanations for enigmatic results obtained from numerical simulations of systems with multiple time scales.

Lagrangian submanifolds and Fukaya categories lie at the heart of Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture and the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow approach to the construction of mirror pairs. The project will focus on geometric phenomena such as instanton corrections in order to gain a better understanding of mirror symmetry and broaden its scope. Lagrangian submanifolds also play a key role in low-dimensional topology, where they enter in the construction of various invariants of 3- and 4-manifolds (closed or with boundary). This motivates the study of bordered Heegaard-Floer homology of 3-manifolds and invariants of broken Lefschetz fibrations on 4-manifolds from the perspective of Fukaya categories of symmetric products, with the aim of providing a richer algebraic framework and revealing new connections.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, this project aims to reinforce the existing connections between various areas of geometry, topology and mathematical physics. Modern theoretical physics has had a tremendous impact on mathematics, and in particular on geometry, where equations arising from field theories have led to new invariants of topological spaces and new conjectures about their geometry. One goal of the project will be to clarify the mathematical validity and scope of predictions inspired by string theory, relating two different areas of mathematics to each other (algebraic geometry, which studies sets defined by polynomial equations, and symplectic geometry, which studies the phase spaces of classical mechanics). On the other hand, the same mathematical ideas have applications to the study of the topology of three and four-dimensional spaces. More specifically, the aim is to explore how slicing such spaces along two-dimensional surfaces can lead to new interpretations of various topological invariants.

The ecological implications of simultaneous eutrophication and overfishing<br/><br/>Overfishing and human-derived nutrient pollution are among the most pressing issues facing coastal environments globally. Both these stressors affect the supply of growth-limiting nutrients (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) for algae and seagrasses, the base of most marine ecosystems. Human inputs increase the supply of nutrients, which are largely sewage-derived, while overfishing has been shown to reduce nutrient supply because fish provide substantial inputs of nutrients via excretion. These contrasting inputs present the paradox that human-derived nutrients may supplant fish-derived nutrients. However, human-derived nutrients are high in P relative to fish-derived nutrients, which may be altering the baseline at which nutrients are supplied and in turn changing the diversity and growth rates of algae and seagrass species. Overfishing and nutrient enrichment will be simulated independently and simultaneously on experimental patch-reef ecosystems in the Bahamas. The implications for changes in diversity, growth and nutrient limitation of algae and seagrass species will be determined . The experimental reef system will be used as a field trip site and experimental results will be used in outreach efforts to local high school students. <br/>Subtropical and tropical marine ecosystems have evolved to function under extremely low nutrient conditions, making them particularly susceptible to even minor alterations in nutrient dynamics. The enormous services provided by these ecosystems appear to critically hinge on the amount and relative supply of N and P, yet understanding of the effects of simultaneous overfishing and eutrophication for these services is lacking, particularly in the Caribbean. Increased understanding of nutrient effects is critical to the management and conservation of marine ecosystems globally.

Stark	06/30/2014	$330,997.00		teleman@math.berkeley.edu	Sponsored Projects Office	BERKELEY	CA	947045940	5106428109	MPS	1267		$0.00	Abstract<br/><br/>Award: DMS-1007255<br/>Principal Investigator: Constantin Teleman<br/><br/>The proposed research comprises several, thematically related<br/>projects at the interface of topology, 2-dimensional quantum<br/>field theory and category theory. The first project, gauged<br/>mirror symmetry, combines group actions on projective manifolds,<br/>equivariant K-theory and ideas from category theory (open-closed<br/>TQFTs and a conjectural Brauer group of equivariant K-theory).<br/>One application would be the determination of Gromov-Witten<br/>theory of GIT quotients from the gauged Fukaya category of a<br/>symplectic manifold. A concrete description of gauged topological<br/>quantum field theories in two dimensions is proposed, based on<br/>recent progress by Kontsevich, Costello, Hopkins and Lurie on<br/>'extended' topological field theories. The PI has a concrete<br/>proposal for coupling a 2-dimensional TQFT to a compact symmetry<br/>group and quantizing the gauged theory. This combines ideas from<br/>physics (Landau-Ginzburg super-potentials) with earlier work by<br/>the PI and collaborators on equivariant (twisted) K-theory and<br/>the general index formula on moduli of principal bundles over<br/>Riemann surfaces. The second project explores the 'higher<br/>algebras' introduced by the PI and collaborators as simplified<br/>models of higher categories, and the a toy example of a<br/>homotopical TQFT for finite homotopy types. This is hoped to be a<br/>good working ground for the interaction of exotic homology<br/>theories with ideas from QFT. A third, closely related project is<br/>the construction of Chern-Simons gauge theory as a 0-1-2-3 theory<br/>by topological methods, along the lines already accomplished by<br/>the PI and collaborators for torus groups.<br/><br/>To explain the context of this research, one must recall that the<br/>fundamental interactions governing energy and matter in the<br/>universe are believed to be governed by quantum field theory, a<br/>sophisticated mathematical framework that has evolved from the<br/>beginnings of quantum mechanics over the last century. Quantum<br/>field theory has never been reconciled with general relativity --<br/>another well-supported physical theory -- and much mathematical<br/>research over the last six decades has centered around<br/>reconciling the two. Topological quantum field theory is a toy<br/>attempt to come to grips with the problem while avoiding the<br/>analytical difficulties: the notions of distance and magnitude<br/>(for instance, mass) are abandoned, and the geometry of<br/>space-time is directly related to the algebraic structure of the<br/>quantum field theory. Substantial progress in understanding the<br/>algebraic structure has been made over the last decade thanks to<br/>work by Kontsevich, Hopkins and Lurie. The PI's projects revolve<br/>around integrating these recent developments with the idea of<br/>symmetry -- in the form of gauge theory -- which is known to be<br/>indispensable in realistic physical theories. (One should recall<br/>that the so-called 'standard model' of particle physics,<br/>comprising the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions, is<br/>a gauge theory.)
1014288	SBIR Phase I: OER Glue	IIP	SMALL BUSINESS PHASE I	07/01/2010	11/24/2010	Joel Duffin	UT	Tatemai, LLC	Standard Grant	Glenn H. Larsen	06/30/2011	$179,961.00		joelduffin@gmail.com	PO Box 529	Millville	UT	843260529	4357702165	ENG	5371	1658, 5371, 9216, HPCC	$0.00	This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the scientific, technical, and commercial merit, and feasibility of building an innovative set of tools and web-based services called Open Educational Resources Glue (OER Glue). The National Science Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, Wikipedia, and other organizations and individuals have developed a plethora of high quality open educational resources (OERs). In order to use OERs to teach a course, teachers need to find them, adapt them, combine them with other resources, create course structures such as syllabi and quizzes, and integrate them with a learning management system (LMS). Currently this is very difficult. OER Glue will help teachers and learners use OERs and Web 2.0 tools in a cohesive manner. Using OER Glue, teachers will be able to efficiently find, create, adapt, use, and share content and learning structures that utilize OER content and take advantage of existing and forthcoming tools. OER Glue will integrate with tools that teachers and learners choose to provide essential course functionality such as content delivery, course scheduling, assignments, testing, discussions, and grading. Examples of tools that can be used include Google Documents, Blogs, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, Del.icio.us, and mobile devices. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Because most LMSs, such as Blackboard and Moodle, require content to be brought into their system and provide their own fixed set of functionality, it is difficult to utilize OER content and integrate external tools with them. In contrast, OER Glue will be designed to let OER content be used where it resides and to provide most functionality by integrating with tools of the user's choice, including Web 2.0 tools that people use outside of school settings. OER Glue is cutting- edge, high risk, high quality research that has a high potential economic payoff. OER Glue will be capable of being transformed into high-value products for teachers and learners. OER Glue will be used to teach online courses, enrich face-to-face classes, and to support life-long learning. OER Glue will provide widgets and programming interfaces that schools and content providers could use to easily integrate OER Glue into their websites. Potential customers include secondary schools, virtual high schools, colleges, and universities. The commercialization model for OER Glue will be similar to the one used by the popular WordPress blogging software; OER Glue will be open source, and packaged for easy install, as well as offered via a low-cost hosted subscription.

Under native conditions, protein molecules are in thermodynamic equilibrium with transiently unfolded conformations. Understanding the nature of this transient unfolding event is one of the central questions in protein biophysics. Structures of partially-unfolded conformations transiently populated under native conditions provide important clues in elucidating protein folding mechanisms. Information on transient partial unfolding is also critical in understanding the mechanisms of protein aggregation, misfolding, and degradation. The intellectual merit of this project is to investigate the rare but critical events of transient partial unfolding proteins undergo in native conditions to further the understanding of how conformation energy landscapes control function and regulation. The specific research objectives are (1) to test the cooperativity of alpha-helix unfolding in the context of a folded protein under native conditions, (2) to test if transient partial unfolding in bacterial periplasmic proteins is a consequence of the conformational energy landscapes optimized for vectorial folding during translocation, and (3) to engineer robust proteins by utilizing information on transient partial unfolding. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this project is education and training of graduate and undergraduate students on the principles of molecular biophysics and their application to real-world problems. First, through participation in this project, graduate and undergraduate students will have a valuable opportunity to learn the basic principles of protein biophysics and biochemistry. Students will be trained in protein engineering, protein expression and purification, and biophysical characterization of proteins through hands-on experience. Second, the results and ideas generated by this project will be directly applied to the development of a new course on biotechnological applications of proteins and peptides. The conformational equilibrium of protein structures, including protein folding, is an excellent topic to expose students to the basic principles of thermodynamics and kinetics and their applications to practical problems. Moreover, findings from this project will provide students with vivid examples of the relevance of protein conformations to practical challenges in the development and application of protein products.

Epitaxial architectures that arrange Ag islands in proximity to Ge/Si(100) quantum dots (QDs) will be investigated to assess plasmonic enhancements to luminescence efficiency. The localized surface plasmon (LSP) mode of the Ag island is predicted to improve both the absorption and emission of photons by the Ge QD. Increased absorption results from the dramatic field concentration near the Ag nanoparticle. The Purcell effect increases the spontaneous emission rate. Recent theoretical work suggests that plasmonic enhancements will be greatest for optimally arranged Ge dots and Ag islands if the LSP resonance frequency is close to that of the QD exciton. The near UV LSP resonance of the Ag islands will be tuned to match the near IR exciton energy of the Ge/Si(100) QDs using a combination of shape resonance effects and by varying their dielectric environment. In the ideal case, theory predicts the luminescence enhancement can approach two orders of magnitude.<br/>One focus will be to determine whether the inhomogeneously strained planar surface of the Si layer that caps the buried Ge dots can affect the thermodynamics or kinetics of Ag island nucleation. The second focus will be on the nm-scale pits found immediately above the Ge dots just prior to completion of the Si cap layer. <br/>Non-technical: this project will positively affect the education and future career of the student(s) involved in the research. They will be trained in the synthesis as well as the structural and optical characterization of materials and architectures in the rapidly growing field of plasmonics. Additionally, links to the highly successful Science is Fun program offered by the Leroy Eyring Center for Solid State Science at ASU will be established.<br/>This program impacts on average 12,000 high and middle school students annually. The PI will work closely with Science is Fun staff and interns to develop hands-on, age-appropriate activities that demonstrate interaction of light with photonic structures using naturally occurring butterfly wings, bird feathers and seashells as ?attention grabbers?.

Active arc-volcanism occurred until about 10 Ma before the present. The age of cessation of volcanism is determined from calc-alkaline intrusives, the exposed roots of eroded volcanoes. These intrusives outcrop along the axis of the range, at elevations as high as 4000 m, so substantial uplift and erosion has occurred. The tectonic causes for the cessation of volcanism and subsequent uplift are not understood and are controversial. The Talamanca range is also interesting because this region has many of the geophysical and geochemical characteristics of continental crust, yet it formed on an entirely oceanic basement, most likely on an oceanic large igneous province. Because of the continental character of the rocks and the rapid uplift, the Talamanca mountains may be able to help geologists understand the process that forms continental crust, a long-standing open problem in geology.<br/><br/>In this EAGER project, the PIs will sample Talamanca intrusives and apply thermochronology to infer the timing and rate of unroofing and uplift. The sampling effort is a pilot study to establish the feasibility of applying thermochronology to the intrusive rocks that comprise the backbone of the Talamanca range. Obviously, a pilot study is not aggressive enough to solve the problem of where, when and how much uplift, but it should allow the setting of limits, the definition of the major local pitfalls and guide a complete study. The acquisition of apatite (U-Th)/He data will provide access to the crucial lower temperature history necessary to more fully decipher the evolution of unroofing and uplift in the region.

Building on the accomplishments of the research community, industry is attempting to create new hardware structures that can help improve security. Particularly noteworthy of these is the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip developed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), a large industry consortium that involves over 100 members. Now, many delivered processors contain TPM chips, with the goal being to provide a place to store keys, protect storage, provide code isolation attestation about the code running on a system -- all functions that can improve security. <br/><br/>Although the hardware provides extremely useful and powerful security properties, researchers have been slow at adopting these techniques towards the design of secure systems. One reason is that users are not familiar with this new technology. <br/><br/>To remedy this situation, the PI is running annual workshops in which the developers of the TPM technology and users who have made effective use of it provided tutorial material and hands-on experiences for the workshop?s participants which included students, faculty, and potential industry users. <br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the workshops is to define a research program for the next decade focused around hardware support for security. This is the second workshop in the series.<br/><br/>The funds requested would be used to reimburse the expenses of graduate and undergraduate students participating in the workshop, which will take place June 7-11, 2009 in Pittsburgh.

The PI (Davis) and Co-PI (Januszkiewicz) plan to compute various types of cohomology for these groups and spaces. They also will study the problem of determining whether branched covers of complex manifolds are nonpositively curved. This is related to a possible attack on the K(pi, 1) Conjecture for Artin groups. Together with Boris Okun the PI plans to compute the cohomology with group ring coefficients as well as the L2 cohomology of Artin groups, Bestvina-Brady groups and graph products of infinite groups. The Co-PI, together with his collaborators in Poland, plans to work on the problem of generalizing his notion of simplicial nonpositive curvature.<br/><br/>Nonpositive curvature relates to areas outside pure mathematics ranging from robotics (via configuration spaces) to statistical mechanics. Coxeter groups are central in many areas of pure mathematics ranging from geometry and topology to dynamical systems to number theory and the theory of Lie groups. The study of Artin groups are a generalization of Artin's braid groups. The braid groups also have been in different areas of mathematics, for example, knot theory and algebraic geometry. The proposed research will have an impact in the area of nonpositive curvature, in the areas of Coxeter groups and Artin groups and other related areas.

One of the central tools is Heegaard Floer homology that was developed by Peter Ozsvath and the Principal Investigator. The PI studies new applications of these techniques for various surgery problems for three dimensional manifolds, slice knots, and exotic structures on smooth 4-manifolds.The proposal also deals with topological and computational aspects of Heegaard Floer homology. This involves the study of special multiply pointed Heegaard diagrams to build up a topological version of the theory. In a different direction new advances in Heegaard Floer homology are used to study three-manifolds with simple Floer homologies.<br/><br/><br/>The project studies three and four dimensional spaces and central problems in Knot Theory and Low Dimensional Topology. Heegaard Floer homology provides various new tools, such as topological invariants and surgery formulas, for low-dimensional mathematical objects. This theory is closely related to gauge theoretical invariants that originated from interactions between Mathematics and Mathematical Physics. It is expected that advances in Heegaard Floer homology will lead to a better understanding of these gauge theoretical invariants as well.

As a result much attention has been paid to the strategies employed by candidates (Lau & Pomper 2004; Brader 2006) and the effects of those tactics on the public (Ansolabehere et al. 1994, 1995, 1999). Yet, comparatively little attention has been directed toward explaining the issue content of the campaign. We are offered volumes of anecdotal evidence suggesting that the candidates are in complete control of which issues are addressed with slogans like it's the economy, stupid! (The War Room 1993) or Change we can believe in (Jamieson 2009). But these accounts do not explain what happens beyond their immediate contexts and offer little toward a broader theory of campaign agenda-setting. one is still left with several questions: What do the patterns of issue attention of modern presidential campaigns look like? Is issue attention by candidates marked with incremental changes, implying that they are in complete control of what issues are addressed? Or, does candidate attention exhibit patterns of stability followed by radical changes, indicating that the candidates' attention is sensitive to outside influence? And perhaps most importantly, who, if anyone, is able to affect the candidates' attention to issues? Their opponents? The mass media? Or the voting public who they are courting?<br/><br/>In this project, the investigator addresses the questions stated above using a dynamic framework to track the candidates' attention to issues over time through the 2000, 2004, and 2008 presidential campaigns. Drawing upon previous work by agenda-setting scholars, the investigator suggests that the candidates? attention to issues will follow Baumgartner and Jones' (1993, 2005) theory of punctuated equilibria (that attention will be marked with radical changes) and that issue attention is susceptible to outside influence. These claims are evaluated using descriptive distributional analysis of the patterns of change in the candidates issue attention over the course of three campaigns. The investigator then examines which issues receive attention by the candidates, the mainstream media, and the public to evaluate the degree to which attention by one actor can affect attention by the others.<br/><br/>This research is important for several reasons. First, it will provide theoretical and empirical contributions to our understanding of the dynamics of presidential campaigns, agenda-setting, and inter-actor relations in the government. Second, evidence indicating that candidates' respective agendas follow patterns of stability and punctuation similar to those found in other studies of agenda-setting will further our understanding of how issues reach the forefront of the campaign. Third and finally, this examination of the outside influences on the candidates' respective agendas will help explain whether the candidates are in complete control of the issue content of the campaign or if they are responsive to the demands of the mass media and the public.<br/><br/>This study also has several broader impacts that are embodied in the new datasets the investigator will make publicly available for future scholarly research. These data will offer insight into the dynamics of presidential campaigns and agendas, but also provide the foundation for empirical examinations of the linkages between campaigns and public policy. Further, these data will assist in furthering scholarship on government responsiveness and connections between public policy and public opinion. Lastly, this project also offers the potential for several undergraduate political scientists to receive training and experiences in advanced research practices, data collection, automated coding, and empirical analysis.

Substantial parts of the research aim to sharpen, recast and unify diverse results in the theory of arithmetic groups into one novel setting, through a concrete general conjecture, with particular emphasis on the 30-year old Margulis-Zimmer conjecture (concerning the structure of commensurated subgroups), as a special case. A key notion in the proposed work is that of harmonicity, which emerges as central ingredient in relation to this<br/>conjecture, as well as in a different suggested direction of rigidity pertaining to Lipschitz harmonic functions on groups (motivated by their use in recent joint work of the PI with Terry Tao).<br/><br/>The theory of so-called arithmetic groups is one of the deepest, most beautiful, fruitful, and long studied ones in modern mathematics. It involves most fields of pure mathematics, from the algebraic side of representation, number, and K-theory, through geometry in its various forms, to the analytic side of ergodic theory and dynamics. The proposed work aims to address some fundamental issues and suggest a recast of parts of the theory, thereby shedding new light and enhancing new developments in the field. Of particular emphasis is a 30-year old conjecture due to Gregory Margulis and Robert Zimmer. Its resolution is expected to involve new dynamical ideas, which are strongly related to harmonicity (roughly speaking, a state which is stable under averaging). Novel investigations and applications of harmonicity are expected to bring progress in other directions of the proposed work.

Preliminary data collected in the beginning of May at the site of the accident show very high concentrations of marine snow in the water, especially in close proximity to the oil/ dispersants. The goal of this project is to evaluate the role these large marine snow-like particles play in the ecosystem during the following weeks to months. Neither the formation mechanisms nor the aggregate composition are known. These investigators will monitor the distribution of marine snow, characterize these particles and measure sedimentation rates to try to understand the role of snow formation and sedimentation in the ecosystem response.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>The characteristics and the potential fate of these marine snow like aggregates, which may potentially sink or float, be grazed, degraded or remain suspended in the water for a long period of time, is unknown. This accident is an opportunity to evaluate and expand our knowledge on reactions of marine ecosystems to such large disturbances in general and more specifically to study the role of aggregation and sedimentation in the process. Marine snow formation and its sedimentation are an essential component of elemental cycling. It has been postulated that sedimentation of material cleans the water column from particles. Marine snow is also thought to be hotspots of microbial activity. Potentially this oily marine snow could not only represent hotspots of activity for oil degrading organisms, but may also function to isolate oil into small volumes. However, rapid sedimentation of such oil aggregates may lead to anoxia at depths. Scientifically we do not understand the possible interactions between marine snow, marine particles, oil and dispersant.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The need to understand the impact of this largest oil spill to date on ecosystems and biochemical cycling is self evident. The consequences of the disaster and accompanying clean up measures (e.g. the distribution of dispersants) need to be evaluated to guide further mediating measures and to develop and improve responses to similar disasters in the future. Would it be advantageous if such oil aggregates sink, or should it rather remain suspended? Possibly measures can be developed to enhance sinking or suspension (e.g. addition of ballast minerals) once we understand their current formation and fate. Understanding the particle dynamics following the input of large amounts of oil and dispersants into the water is a prerequisite to develop response strategies for now and in the future.

The project will measure distributed power generation, peak shaving, renewable back-up, CHP, and propulsion.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact and the novelty of the approach of the project will be that the unusual geometry of the turbine, which would allow the blades to be held in compression and all cooling of the assembly accomplished with a low-pressure fan rather than the compressor, thereby further increasing system efficiency. In addition, the ceramic turbine blades have the potential to increase gas turbine efficiency thus conserving fuel usage and providing a reduction in exhaust emissions.

As stated in the proposal the objective of the workshop is to clearly assess and define synergistic relationships between Western science an Indigenous Knowledge paradigms... and to implement the project plan through identification of community-driven science questions, data collection and engagement between scientists and community members to facilitate the development of adaptive strategies for communities within the Yukon River Basin.<br/><br/>The three-day workshop will be held in Colorado in September 2010. The purpose of the workshop is to design a science research project built to assess the sustainability of Yukon River Basin communities under the conditions of climate change, current and anticipated, while fully incorporating the Indigenous communities of the Yukon watershed. The potential proposal includes scientific training for participants in qualitative and quantitative data collection; mixed methodologies, including focus groups, target surveys, and interviews; geospatial database construction, and quantitative methods for gathering data on the river system - including snow, ice, water quality, ecosystem assessments, etc. The participant list includes the YRITWC Members, National Weather Service, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, RMRS, USGS, CSU, U.S. Forest Service, and special guest include Henry Huntington (Pew Charitable Trust Foundation) and Shari Gearheard (National Snow & Ice Data Center). The wide experience, locally and internationally, make for a dynamic team with rich history in the field.
1011284	DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Carbon Cycle Changes in a Changing Climate: Using 13C and 14C to Partition Ecosystem Respiration in Tundra Undergoing Permafrost Thaw	DEB	ECOSYSTEM STUDIES	07/01/2010	06/28/2010	Edward Schuur	FL	University of Florida	Standard Grant	Richard S. Inouye	06/30/2011	$14,941.00	Caitlin Hicks	ted.schuur@nau.edu	1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA	GAINESVILLE	FL	326112002	3523923516	BIO	1181	9169, EGCH	$0.00	Permafrost soils, which are soils frozen for two or more consecutive years, store vast quantities of carbon (C). These soils are reservoirs of C because thousands of years of cold temperatures have prevented the microbial decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC), and thus the subsequent release of carbon dioxide (CO2) from soils to the atmosphere. However, permafrost soils are very vulnerable to warming; as the climate warms, permafrost soils begin to thaw, which allows microbes to access and decompose stored SOC , thereby releasing CO2. Permafrost thaw, therefore, has the potential to become a positive feedback to climate change: CO2 in the atmosphere can increase warming, and warming of permafrost soils can result in more CO2 release to the atmosphere via increased rates of decomposition and ecosystem respiration. However, permafrost thaw can also increase plant growth, which takes CO2 out of the atmosphere via photosynthesis, and may, in the short term, result in a negative feedback to climate change. Thus the relative responses of both soil microbes and plants to permafrost thaw determine whether, on balance, permafrost ecosystems add CO2 to the atmosphere (microbial response and positive feedback) or whether the ecosystem takes CO2 from the atmosphere (plant response and negative feedback.) The main objective of this research is to quantify the response of four components of ecosystem respiration, all of which result in release of CO2 to the atmosphere (aboveground plant structures, belowground plant structures, surface soil microbes, and deep soil microbes) to permafrost thaw in order to determine whether plant or microbial responses are dominating the Alaska tundra's changing carbon cycle. <br/><br/>Natural abundances of two carbon isotopes, 13C and 14C, will be used to identify the sources of respired CO2. By measuring the isotopic values of CO2 sources as well as ecosystem respiration, the relative contribution of soil microbes and plants to carbon fluxes can be calculated. This ecosystem respiration partitioning will be performed seasonally in a natural gradient of permafrost thaw, in a tundra warming experiment, and in an area with two different amounts of vegetation and two different soil climates to explore the effects of permafrost thaw on the carbon balance of tundra ecosystems.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of this research, undergraduate students will be trained, 8th grade students will be educated, and a layperson's guide to C cycling in permafrost will be created. Finally, the results of this study will be important to climate models; these models do not currently consider biological responses to the physics of climate warming.

With Scratch, young people (ages 8 and up) can program their own interactive stories, games, animations, and simulations, then share their creations with others online. Young people around the world have already shared more than 1 million projects on the Scratch community website (http://scratch.mit.edu). The new generation, called Scratch 2.0, will be fully integrated into the Internet, so that young people can more seamlessly share and collaborate on projects, access online data, and program interactions with social media.<br/>The research is divided into two strands:<br/><br/>-Technological infrastructure for creative collaboration. With Scratch 2.0, people will be able to design and program new types of web-based interactions and services. For example, they will be able to program interactions with social-media websites (such as Facebook), create visualizations with online data, and program their own collaborative applications.<br/><br/>-Design experiments for creative collaboration. As the team develops Scratch 2.0, they will run online experiments to study how their design decisions influence the ways in which people collaborate on creative projects, as well as their attitudes towards collaboration.<br/><br/>This work builds on a previous NSF grant (ITR-0325828) that supported the development of Scratch. Since its public launch in 2007, Scratch has become a vibrant online community, in which young people program and share interactive stories, games, animations, and simulations - and, in the process, learn important computational concepts and strategies for designing, problem solving, and collaborating. Each day, members of the Scratch community upload nearly 1500 new Scratch projects to the website - on average, a new project almost every minute.<br/><br/>In developing Scratch 2.0, the team will focus on two questions from the NSF Program Solicitation:<br/>-Will the research lead to the development of new technologies to support human creativity?<br/>-Will the research lead to innovative educational approaches in computer science, science, or engineering that reward creativity?<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The intellectual merit of the project is based on its study of how new technologies can foster creativity and collaboration. The investigators will conduct design experiments to examine how new features of Scratch 2.0 engage young people in new forms of creative expression, collaboration, learning, and metadesign. Young people are already interacting with many cloud-based services (such as YouTube and Facebook). But Scratch 2.0 is fundamentally different in that it aims to engage people in programming their own projects and activities in the cloud. With Scratch 2.0, young people won?t just interact with the cloud, they will create in the cloud. The goal is to democratize the development of cloud-based activities, so that everyone can become an active contributor to the cloud, not just a consumer of cloud-based services. This development and study of Scratch 2.0 will lead to new insights into strategies for engaging young people in activities that cultivate collaboration and creativity. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The broader impact of the project is based on its ability to broaden participation in programming and computer science. The current version of Scratch has already helped attract a broader diversity of students to computer science compared to other programming platforms. The investigators expect that the collaboration and social-media features of Scratch 2.0 will resonate with the interests of today's youth and further broaden participation. Integration of Scratch into the introductory computer science course at Harvard led to a sharp reduction in the number of students dropping the course, and an increase in the retention of female students. There have been similar results in pre-college courses. The National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) calls Scratch a ?promising practice? for increasing gender diversity in IT.

The technology overcomes the stability and lifetime issues faced by conventional bio-fuel cells where rare metals serve as the catalyst. Development of the bioanode for the fuel cell power supply is based on Akermin?s proprietary enzyme stabilization technology. Such a fuel cell can be used for many lower power devices, including microelectrical mechanical devices, unattended ground sensors, and small mobile power devices. This technology has advantages over similar competing technologies (i.e., batteries and conventional fuel cells) when addressing the needs of small remote sensors and electronics.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be: 1. that it will be environment friendly because a successful enzyme-based fuel cell holds the promise of replacing batteries currently used in many applications including remote sensing and human implants; 2. it will provide improved power supplies for both remote sensors and drug delivery devices that would be a significant benefit to society; and 3. the proposed product has reasonable commercial potential and potential customers have been identified.

This is a great opportunity for these junior mathematicians to familiarize themselves with the frontiers of research in this very active subject and in the future contribute to it. In addition, many of the participants (e.g. two of the main speakers) are anticipated to be women. Based on initial inquiries, it is also likely that several of US based mathematicians that will be supported on this grant, if funded, will be women.<br/><br/>Geometric group theory is a relatively new area of mathematics whose object is study groups by first constructing a geometric object whose symmetries form the given group and then to analyze the geometry of this object. An important example of this is the group of symmetries of a free group, realized geometrically as the so called Outer space, constructed by Culler and Vogtmann.

Specifically, the unique catalytic properties of Au nanoparticles or their clusters are strongly affected by their size, shape (platelets, rods, etc.) and the metal oxide host material. While supported nanoparticles have been shown to be unstable and generally form spheres at elevated temperatures, embedded nanoparticles have been shown to retain their unique shapes at elevated temperatures. Thus they show great promise for enabling unique catalytic reactions at elevated temperatures. In this project, they will systematically study catalytic reactions at the interface of the metal/metal oxide nanocomposite to determine how the size and shape of the metal nanoparticle as well as the ceramic?s chemistry affect the reaction. The project will provide educational opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students through an outreach program which will enable both research and education focused outcomes. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: They will develop an all-optical localized surface plasmon resonance/micro surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (LSPR/uSERS) analytical method for the study of gold nanoparticle (AuNP)- metal oxide nanocomposite films with precise grain size and shape control. The unique catalytic properties of Au nanoparticles or their clusters are strongly affected by their size, shape (platelets, rods, etc.) and metal oxide host material. However, supported particles are thermally unstable at elevated temperatures and tend to grow and or become spherical and thus their unique catalytic properties are not amenable for a broad range of thermal environments. Embedded particles have been shown to be more stable and will be deposited using electron beam lithography and aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition and these will be studied for their thermal stability as well as for their unique optical and catalytic activity. As catalytic reactions typically involve a number of charge transfer events, plasmonic studies will be used to determine the total charge on the catalytically active nanoparticle in parallel with uSERS for probing both the surface chemistry as well as the metal oxide host. This project will enable the development and study of novel catalytically active materials, new plasmonic sensing array paradigms as well as an educational outreach program for graduate, undergraduate and high school students.

Goldschmidt 2010 meeting. The purpose of the meeting is to gather input from the Geobiology and Low-Temperature Geochemistry research community with the larger aim of identifying emerging research opportunities and broad science priorities for the coming decade. The 2010 V.M. Goldschmidt Conference provides a unique opportunity to reach a strong representation of the community because it brings together the many realms within geobiology and geochemistry. It is a primary aim of the Town Hall meeting to enable the Geobiology and Low-Temperature Geochemistry community to identify research priorities and define the big, fundamental questions that will drive the field over the coming decade. Input from both meetings will provide grist for a Workshop to be held in the fall of 2010 that will bring together community representatives to synthesize Town Hall meeting input and identify research priorities. Input from the Town Hall meetings and research opportunities and priorities identified at the subsequent Workshop are intended to inform members of the committee on New Research Opportunities in the Earth Sciences (NROES) recently commissioned by the National Research Council. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>The aims of this small proposal are to foster community input and dialog regarding the scientific opportunities and priorities in Geobiology and Low-Temperature Geochemistry. The requested funds will be used to create a welcoming environment and an opportunity to engage individuals across the demographic spectrum in this process.

Despite broad interest in the issue, little consensus has emerged from this intense research scrutiny. Recent advances in our understanding of the relationships between the groups of animals closely related to chordates, and the technological advances from molecular genetics, make this key issue much more experimentally tractable. This work investigates the developmental biology of a phylum called hemichordates, which is one of the most closely related groups to chordates. <br/>Approach: This project examines how the mesoderm and endoderm are set up in this phylum. The mesoderm is a tissue layer that gives rise to many of the key innovations of our own phylum such as skeleton and the associated complex musculature. The endoderm gives rise to our complex gut and associated glands. Expected results: Investigating the role of genes with conserved roles in inducing and patterning chordate endoderm and mesoderm will help reconstruct the early evolution of these tissue layers and how they were modified and diversified to produce the critical morphological structures that define our phylum. A comparative study of the gene networks involved in endoderm and mesoderm development will give additional insights into how they function in vertebrates. <br/>Broader impacts: This project will involve the training and participation of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Chicago. The PI and graduate students will present the results at a broad range of institutions and internally conferences.

The use of magnetic technologies has the potential to improve the energy efficiency of removing algae from growth media. The use of a magnetic separation technology introduces an energy efficient means by which algae can be dewatered and converted into bio-fuels in an integrated bio-refinery. Using algal strains modified to overproduce ferritin (a magnetically susceptible bio-particle) enables the removal of algae from contaminating biomass as well.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impact of the project will be magnetic harvesting and dewatering of algal product which could lead to higher efficiencies of oil production. This will enable the use of low cost open pond culturing systems for the production of biofuels using microalgae. The development of technologies using magnetically responsive algae (either<br/>direct, or through association with magnetically responsive particles) to either separate them from growth media and contaminants or to induce cell lysis and aide in oil extraction. The project targets the two highest cost factors in algal oil production, namely dewatering and extraction.

Currently, effective fertilizer management is often limited by the lack of accurate soil nutrient data, which in turn is limited by the time and cost of soil sampling and analysis. In particular, nitrogen is one of the most critical nutrients for a large number of crops, but the difficulty in accurately and quickly measuring local soil nitrate-nitrogen has hampered the efficient management of nitrogen based fertilizers. A robust, economical, and fast soil nitrate measurement system thus has the potential to significantly increase agricultural nitrogen use efficiency. The objective of this proposal is the development of a rapid nitrate soil sensor utilizing the optical detection of nitrate-nitrogen in soil. The feasibility of directly measuring soil nitrate-nitrogen (without reagents) in soil-extractant mixtures will be determined, and appropriate methods for removing interferences from the soil background will be developed. This feasibility study will form the initial step in developing a field-deployable soil nitrate analysis system.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in allowing growers to rapidly and economically measure soil nitrate-nitrogen levels, thus enabling them to improve their fertilizer management decisions. For example, split application of nitrogen (through sidedressing) is known to greatly improve nitrogen use efficiency. However, sidedressing is very time sensitive, and management decisions of how much nitrogen to apply are often limited by the cost and slow turnaround of current soil testing procedures. Additionally, it is anticipated that the development of a rapid soil nitrate measurement tool will facilitate the improvement of current fertilizer prescriptions by providing researchers with a valuable tool for field studies. The development of a rapid soil nitrate measurement tool thus offers the opportunity to greatly increase fertilizer use efficiency. Fertilizer is a significant agricultural cost (over $18 B was spent in the U.S. on fertilizer in 2007) and the inefficient use of fertilizer has large additional societal and environmental costs: nitrous oxide arising from nitrogen-based fertilizer use causes between 4%-9% of the driving force for global warming, and nitrogen runoff from agriculture causes serious water quality issues, both locally and nationally. Thus improving fertilizer management will have large economic and environmental benefits.

These short contacts are of interest for two reasons: <br/>-Short bonds are essential for enhanced overlap and conductivity between molecular species; new properties might emerge if materials can be designed with molecules that pack significantly more closely than the van der Waals separation. <br/>-The chemical bond is a central concept in the physical sciences: are these extremely short contacts bonds? What affects them, and can they be made even shorter than observed until now? <br/> To study these systems, Kertesz and coworkers apply and evaluate a a variety of density functional (DFT)-based methods. They are extending a novel van der Waals density functional (vdW-DFT) developed by Langreth and coworkers to a spin-unrestricted formalism. They also employ hybrid meta GGA functionals, empirically supplemented DFT and wave function methods. <br/><br/>Materials with short intermolecular van der Waals bonds are very different from classical organic compounds. They exhibit anomalous electrical, magnetic and optical properties that may be exploited technologically.

Regions within the Amazon have quickly emerged as significant producers of grains and oilseeds, and they now provide consumers across the world with vegetable oils and animal feeds vital to distant economies. Despite the fact that beef production remains the primary driver of Amazonian deforestation, questions have emerged about the potential environmental impact associated with the expansion of large-scale agriculture in the region. This doctoral dissertation research project will address this issue and considers the impact of soybean production on regional forest cover. The doctoral student will focus the project on two principal questions: (1) By what mechanism does intensification at the intensive margin (with soybean production) influence the expansion of less intensive production strategies, such as ranching? (2) To what extent is pasture-led forest loss linked to encroachment by more intensive agricultural production on existing pastures? By answering these questions, the student will seek to ascertain how much Amazonian deforestation is caused by soybean farming, both from direct encroachments into forest and by virtue of compensatory pasture expansion following displacement by soybeans. He will employ a conceptual framework based on an adaptation of Thunian rent theory and considers the cascading spatial effects that emerge as land uses expand on one another, specifically the pushing of soybean farming against existing pastures. He will use a spatial-temporal regression model to test the relationship between regional expansion of soybean production and increases in cattle populations at distant locations. His statistical work will be complemented by interviews with producers' organizations in order to ascertain the destination of displaced ranchers, to understand production shifts associated with changes in ownership, and to gain greater behavioral insight into land-use dynamics. The project intends to fully comprehend the linkage between the expansion of soybean production and forest loss attributable to clearings for new pastures.<br/><br/>This project will provide a better understand of the factors affecting Amazonian forest loss. It will consider the role of soybeans as an underlying factor of pasture-led deforestation, and it will provide new information and insights regarding the mechanisms through which this occurs. In so doing, the project will bring to light linkages between soybean and cattle that have until now gone largely unseen, hidden by the regional land-use system. Project results will be useful for policy makers, managers, and members of the public who are attempting to strike a balance between regional economic demands and the preservation of the forest cover. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career. This project will be supported based on the joint recommendation of the NSF Geography and Spatial Sciences Program and the Americas Program in the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.

In the commercial longline fishing industry, it is not uncommon to capture more sharks than target fish. Unintended shark catch, or bycatch, results because a baited hook is equally attractive to both fish and sharks. If unwanted sharks can be selectively repelled, the target fish catch can be maximized, allowing the industry to remain sustainable, profitable, and eligible for incentives from fishery regulators. To address this selective fishing requirement, the proposed technology combines two known shark repellent technologies directly into a fishing hook: Magnetism and electropositivity. These repellents affect the shark's unique electrical sense and are not detectable by tuna and swordfish, which lack the electrical sense. The proposed technology is transparent to fishermen because it will not require external power and will not change the shape, function, or handling of a standard hook. <br/><br/>The broader/commercial impacts of this research are the training of new scientists and increased understanding of shark behavior and shark repellent materials. By identifying compounds with selective shark repellent activity, marine biologists will have an enhanced understanding of the behavioral differences between sharks and fishes. Technological understanding will be advanced identifying surface treatment techniques for metals used in marine environments. These techniques will provide direction for future shark-repellent coatings for marine aquaculture and marine infrastructure.

The classical approach to dealing with multiplicity is to require decision rules that control the familywise error rate, the probability of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis. But when the number of tests is large, control of the familywise error rate is so stringent that alternative hypotheses have little chance of being detected. In response, the false discovery rate and other measures of error control have gained wide use. For each measure of error control, it is desired to construct procedures that exhibit error control under the weakest possible assumptions. Resampling methods offer viable approaches to obtaining valid distributional approximations while assuming very little about the stochastic mechanism generating the data. While many new methods have been developed, many more questions remain and are studied. Some of the technical challenges include: asymptotics that grow with both sample size and number of tests; orders of error in approximation; uniformity in approximation; optimality theory; direction errors. Related problems are also studied, such as the statistical evaluation of bioequivalence across multiple measures, testing for stochastic dominance, and inference for partially identified econometric models.<br/><br/>Virtually any scientific experiment sets out to answer questions about the process under investigation, which often can be translated formally into a set of hypotheses. It is the exception that a single hypothesis is considered. For example, in clinical trials, even a single treatment may be evaluated using multiple outcome measures, multiple time points, multiple doses, and multiple subgroups. Moreover, due to effects of ``data snooping'' (or ``data mining''), additional hypotheses arise as well. The statistician is then faced with the challenge of accounting for all possible errors resulting from a complex data analysis, so that any resulting inferences or interesting conclusions can reliably be viewed as real structure rather than artifacts of random data. In general, the philosophical approach is the development of practical methods that may be applied in increasingly complex situations as the scope of modern data analysis continues to grow. The broader impact of this work is potentially quite large because the resulting inferential tools can be applied to such diverse fields as genetics, bioengineering, image processing and neuroimaging, clinical trials, education, astronomy, finance and econometrics. For example, current methods in biotechnology and genomics generate DNA microarray experiments, where expression levels in cells for thousands of genes must be analyzed simultaneously. The many burgeoning fields of applications demand new statistical methods, creating challenging and exciting opportunities for young scholars under the direction of the PI.

The PIs also intend to further establish an internationally recognized research center that can help shape public policy, as related to timber management, reforestation, and the reduction of fossil fuel usage by using the advanced products.

One of the mathematical manifrestation of the duality is the conjecural Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas duality due to Maulik, Nekrasov, Okounkov and Pandharipande. The conjecture relates the generating function for the integrals over the module space of stable curves in the threefolds to the generating function for the integrals over Hilbert scheme of curves in the threefold. At the moment we are able to prove the conjecture for the toric threefolds. To prove the conjecture for the general threefold the relative version of the duality need to be addressed. This is the focus of our research. We also hope to explore the connections between Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas theory and the quantum cohomology of the Hilbert scheme of points on the surface. At the moment these relations are fully understood only for the surfaces which are resolutions of the simple singularities. <br/><br/> It is a classical problem in geometry to compute the number of curves satisfying some natural geometric conditions. For example, one can ask how many lines in three-dimensional space intersect four given lines. In this case the answer is either infinity, two or one (depending on the position of the four lines). The first advances this type of problems are due to 19 century<br/>italian algebraic geometers. Recent advances are motivated by the new insights coming from physics. In particular String theory and Gauge theory give two ways of looking at the curves in three-dimensional space. The first theory treats the curves as the traces of the flying closed strings, for the second theory the curve is defined by simultaneous vanishing of two equations.<br/>Interplay between this two approaches is in the center of our research.

Generally, the researchers will improve existing analytical methods and develop new statistical methods for the reconstruction of past climates from heterogeneous geological proxies (tree rings, ice cores, speleothems, corals, sediments), with particular emphasis on regional variability over the past two millennia. <br/><br/>Specifically, the research team will use the regularized expectation-maximization algorithm (RegEM) algorithm to exploit linear covariation in space among different climate variables or proxies to impute missing values and estimate climate statistics. The goal is to directly address uncertainties in data, especially surrounding missing data within a series. This is important for paleoclimate data sets since the spatial or temporal series may not be continuous.<br/><br/>The broader impacts involve the training of students across disciplinary boundaries in a timely integration of statistics and climatology.

Such organizations have an interest in accelerating the creation of technology-driven entrepreneurial enterprises, and have a history of establishing programs to train technologists for entrepreneurship. To be successful, these teams must learn to operate cohesively, establish a thoughtful and implementable business strategy, obtain needed resources, and execute on the strategy. This research project aims to provide an instructional framework to maximize these goals by enhancing the existing assessment tools, building a simulation test-bed of entrepreneur 'games' and testing these simulations and the educational program with sample groups. The end product will be a tested program including assessments, feedback, and a single simulation which will be piloted several times using grant funding for data collection and refinement. <br/><br/>The project outcomes will impact small early-stage companies from pre-funding through to venture capital funding. Such organizations are typically cash-strapped, and will be unable to pay out of their own pocket to attend workshops and purchase software that are not directly focused on each of their core technologies. However, companies are willing to attend workshops to improve entrepreneurial skills when those are sponsored by other organizations. Such types of organizations have both a vested interest in creating more viable high growth companies, both from an economic development and licensing revenue perspective, and they both have funding that they have been willing to put to work delivering programming to prospective entrepreneurs

Virginia Polytechnic (VT) and Oregon State University (OSU) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with VT as the lead institution. <br/><br/>The proposed Center will advance the materials science of wood and wood-based composites, by improving the understanding of how wood interacts with adhesives, sealants, and composite manufacturing variables. The Center will promote research in building systems, mechanical and adhesive fastening between wood and non-wood materials, as well as novel material testing and modeling. The PIs also intend to further establish an internationally recognized research center that can help shape public policy, as related to timber management, reforestation, and the reduction of fossil fuel usage by using the advanced products. The two institutions involved in the proposed center have experience in working with industrial partners and conducting research projects. <br/><br/>The development of more advanced wood-based composites to be used in applications that currently depend primarily on steel, aluminum or concrete would have a positive impact on the environment and help combat climate change. The proposed Center plans to attract graduate and undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines, and to provide them with an opportunity to interact with industry leaders, thus giving them an understanding of how to apply and transfer fundamental research and impact the industry and the economy.

Currently, the invasive procedures of amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling are used to physically remove fetal cells from amniotic fluid or placenta for prenatal genetic analysis. These invasive procedures carry significant risk to both mother and fetus. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop technology to isolate and expand fetal trophoblast cells from maternal peripheral blood for non-invasive prenatal diagnostics. Fetal trophoblast cells are present in insufficient numbers in maternal peripheral blood for direct use in existing commercial prenatal diagnostic tests. The technical challenge that will be addressed in this proposal is to exploit the natural characteristics of fetal trophoblast cells to selectively expand them in culture by modifying culture conditions to obtain a sufficiently high concentration of fetal trophoblasts for prenatal diagnostic testing. The proposed Phase I project will deliver groundbreaking advances in isolation and expansion of fetal trophoblast cells necessary for innovative development of a device and technology for microfluidic isolation and expansion of fetal trophoblasts from maternal peripheral blood for non-invasive prenatal diagnostics.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that our innovative technology will replace the current invasive methods of fetal cell collection for prenatal diagnosis of genetic disease. With our technology, fetal cell collection can be performed non-invasively in the first trimester, thus permitting earlier diagnosis of genetic disease which, in turn, will provide for better care of the mother and unborn infant. Our technology provides the simplest, most direct, and most cost-effective approach available for obtaining fetal cells. Approximately 300,000 women have an invasive amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling procedure performed to collect fetal cells for screening for chromosomal abnormalities. After initial introduction of our technology, later market penetration will permit this technology to replace current pre-screening blood tests, a current available market of approximately 2.5 million patients per year in the US alone. Potential market size for our technology is approximately $1.4 billion per year. Several clinical diagnostics companies have expressed interest in purchasing a microfluidic separation device that can capture fetal cells of sufficient number and purity from maternal peripheral blood. Clinical diagnostics labs would use the captured fetal cells in their downstream genetic analyses.

The motivating examples include the group GL(n,Z) acting on the deformation space of flat n-tori and the group Out(Fn) acting on the deformation space of compact metric graphs with fundamental group Fn. The project has four main components, which take off from these basic examples in various directions. The first component, joint with Martin Bridson, studies rigidity properties of  Out(Fn) which limit the possibilities for maps between Out(Fn) and Out(Fm) and constrain the possible actions of Out(Fn) on spheres, contractible manifolds and CAT(0) spaces. The second component, joint with Ruth Charney, targets automorphism groups of  right-angled Artin groups. In recent work Charney and the PI have shown that many properties shared by Out(Fn) and GL(n,Z) are in fact shared by the outer automorphism groups of all right-angled Artin groups. The tools used have been largely algebraic, but this project will develop new geometric tools using CAT(0) geometry.   The third component, joint with John Smillie, considers deformation spaces of flat surfaces of arbitrary genus. The proposal is to define a bordification of the space of marked translation surfaces with a fixed number of singular points which descends to a compactification of the moduli space of such translation surfaces. This is motivated by analogous bordifications of spaces for SL(n, Z) and Out(Fn) and combines ideas from both, and should be useful in studying cohomological properties of these groups.  The fourth part of the project, joint with Jim Conant and Martin Kassabov,   returns to Out(Fn) and investigates the rational cohomology of Out(Fn) via the connection found by Kontsevich between this cohomology and the cohomology of a certain Lie algebra associated to the Lie operad.<br/><br/>A powerful tool in mathematics is to encode the structure of a geometric object in an algebraic form.  One can then use algebraic ideas to study the geometric object, or geometric ideas to study the algebraic object.   This proposal uses a bootstrap of this idea to the next level:  one can relate the group of {\it transformations}, or {\it automorphisms} of an algebraic object to the space of {\it deformations} of an associated geometric object.   The underlying algebraic objects are quite simple:  they are free groups, free abelian groups and right-angled Artin groups, but their automorphism groups are remarkably complex and still poorly understood.  Similarly, the associated algebraic objects (trees, Euclidean spaces and CAT(0) spaces) are uncomplicated but their deformation spaces exhibit complex  behavior, which has implications in many areas of pure and applied mathematics.   The project will employ   topological and geometric tools to understand these deformation spaces and translate the information obtained into new information about automorphism groups.

The platform, referred to as Memory Based Multimedia Signal Processing (MBMSP), leverages on the fact that both nanoscale silicon as well as regular and periodic structures of many emerging nanoscale devices are amenable to dense, high-performance memory design. In MBMSP, algorithmic tasks are functionally decomposed into multi-input, multi-output functions, which are then mapped as lookup tables in a memory array and evaluated in a time-multiplexed, topological fashion using a small controller. This fundamentally different approach to information processing can be effective in developing a scalable platform with high-performance, reconfigurability, energy-efficiency and reliability for diverse and complex signal processing systems. The research seeks to develop circuit-µ-architecture-software co-design approach for MBMSP including software architecture to improve performance and scalability; circuit-µ-architecture techniques for memory cell and array to achieve low-power and robustness; software-hardware co-design approach for energy and reliability; and a Spin-Torque-Transfer Random Access Memory (STTRAM) based platform for scaling MBMSP to deep nanometer nodes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The MBMSP platform can potentially transform the traditional approach to design multimedia signal processing system. The research will integrate education through course module development and undergraduate research projects. The teaching modules will be adapted for the local high-school students, including about 40% minority/under-represented students, who join the pre-college program at Case Western Reserve University every summer. The modules will focus on hands-on learning approaches for multimedia/digital signal processing systems and new ways to design them. PIs will continue their involvement with Facilitating Academic Careers in Engineering and Science for African-American (FACES) and Summer Undergraduate Research Experience for minorities (SURE). PIs will mentor one SURE student every summer and involve them in the proposed research.

The scientists will focus on investigating changes to the abundance and virulence of Vibrio bacteria in response to stress associated with exposure to the oil and/or indirect effects associated with biological interactions within biological communities impacted by the oil. <br/><br/>The research team will evaluate whether there will be an increase in the abundance of Vibrio and prevalence of Type III Secretion System 2 (TTSS2) in the location of the oil spill. TTSS2 on Vibrio is carried on a pathogenic island (PAI) that includes numerous genes. Since some of these genes are necessary for environmental adaptation, and this PAI is mobile and transferable among Vibrio, the team hypothesizes there will be an increase in the abundance of Vibrio carrying genes associated with type III secretion systems. Bulk bacterial communities and plankton composition will also be evaluated in size-fractionated water column samples across salinity and oil gradients to understand how these communities will be affected by the oil spill and how these changes will affect Vibrio abundance. The team will quantify if there is an increase in concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons in oysters and whether this increase will affect Vibrio abundance in oysters. Additionally, the team will study excretions from phytoplankton species that may be able to inhibit growth of Vibrio.<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts of this proposal include participation of one postdoctoral researcher and one PhD student. The results from this study will be useful for understanding the environmental consequences of future similar disasters.

The nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) and its vector generalization are universal asymptotic models for quasi-monochromatic waves in nonlinear media. Both NLS and vector NLS are completely integrable and can therefore be solved by the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) method. However, this method for vector NLS in the normal dispersion regime (defocusing regime) is not yet fully developed. Hence, the complete development of this method and description of the soliton interactions is a principal part of the project. The coupled Maxwell-Bloch system, which arises as a model in atomic physics, laser physics and optics, will also be investigated by a suitable adaptation of the IST method. Further, the IST method will be extended to the recently derived short-pulse equation, which provides a more appropriate model than the quasi-monochromatic approximation. Theoretical development of the IST for these systems and elucidation of the soliton dynamics will be guided by numerical simulation and direct methods for constructing special solutions.<br/><br/>Because of their physical applicability in such diverse fields as water waves, magnetic spin waves, optical fibers, waveguides and Bose-Einstein condensates, NLS and other systems investigated in this project are of wide scientific relevance. Dynamics of their solitary wave (soliton) solutions is also of keen interest from the point of view of applications, as interaction of vector solitons sets forth the experimental foundations for designing controlled logic gates and all-optical computers, of the phenomenon of self-induced transparency, as well as a mechanism for polarization switching of light in multi-level media. The equations investigated in this project are not only models for phenomena at the frontier of physical science, but also have intrinsic mathematical value. The development of a modern IST for these equations will advance the fundamental understanding of complex physical phenomena in a unified mathematical framework and provide concrete information about the behavior of such systems. The collaborative nature of the research program, both between the principal investigators and with colleagues at nearby institutions, will serve to accelerate the development of an interconnected research community accessible to students at Montclair State and at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (both undergraduate institutions). Significantly, the student population at both institutions includes a substantial number of members of underrepresented groups and the collaboration leverages existing programs directed to these students

To determine the feasibility of iCare, the project will examine its usability using Neilsen's Usability Model to guide the testing with faculty and health care students through focus groups, following eXtreme Programming development process. <br/><br/>With EHRs penetrating the health care sector, new graduates must be proficient in using EHRs prior to entering the workforce. Currently, there are over 3,000 nursing schools in the U.S., with approximately 400,000 students enrolled annually and only 1% of these schools with access to academic EHRs. This Phrase I project will seamlessly integrate research and education through the commercialization of iCare and the findings and insights with focus group studies aiming to close the competency gaps between preparing health care students and accessing state-of-the-art EHRs to train health care professionals.

The PIs are building on a large database of pre-spill baseline microbiology and biogeochemistry at a microbial observatory (Mississippi Canyon 118) near the Deepwater Horizon site they have occupied since 2005. They are applying molecular, gene-based analyses of the microbial community structure and function in surface water and underlying sediments; in situ water column dissolved oxygen and light hydrocarbon measurements using advanced sensor technologies (Seaguard system) for deep water plume tracking; and a biogeochemical survey of the sediments and water in the immediate vicinity of and at increasing distance from the oil spill, and on different time scales during follow-up cruises. 16S rRNA and functional gene sequencing of total microbial DNA and RNA from contaminated and clean water and sediments will monitor how the oil-affected microbial community changes in composition and activity. High-throughput pyrosequencing of PCR-amplified rRNA fragments will increase the coverage by approx. three orders of magnitude, and allow for the detection of minority microbial populations that go unnoticed in conventional clone libraries. Special attention will be paid to the enrichment of oil-degrading bacteria in natural samples and in time-series experiments conducted in the lab, to monitor their growth with group-specific PCR, to monitor geochemical changes concomitant with the establishment and enrichment of a hydrocarbon-degrading microbial community, and to identify potential carbon incorporation pathways with stable isotope probing of nucleic acids. Summarizing, this RAPID project focuses on molecular and microbiological assessments of hydrocarbon impact, across the spatial and time scales of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill as determined by diagnostic water column oxygen and light hydrocarbon measurements. The water column microbiological and dissolved gas data will be linked to potential impacts on the bacterial activity in bottom sediments through measurements of geochemical indicators of sedimentary anaerobic microbial activity, and porewater analyses of DIC, CH4 and low-molecular weight organic acids, the principal products of hydrocarbon degradation. The PIs are coordinating their research with Mandy Joye at the University of Georgia.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The results of this RAPID project will identify which bacterial and archaeal populations, and in which sequence, respond to oil spill events in marine sediments and the water column, and the attendant - often beneficial - biogeochemical consequences of this massive restructuring of the microbial community and their activities. Most importantly, this project provides comprehensive microbial and geochemical coverage of different marine habitats (deep and shallow marine sediments, water column, surface) on the geographical and time scale of the oil spill as it is unfolding. This independent analysis will contribute to an observation-based and results-oriented reference database that, at present, the various interested players in the Deepwater Horizon saga cannot provide. The PIs are working on national publicity for our cruises and on-site work, by taking a National Geographic writer (Joel Bourne) on the current RV Walton Smith cruise, and interviews with Scientific American and National Geographic. The PIs have developed an extensive student-oriented outreach component that entrains - with a combination of teaching, lab internships, conference visits and virtual as well as real cruise exposure - undergraduates from different backgrounds into grant-driven research and gives them an early start on substantial, publishable research projects. The Martens lab has been active since 2005 in partnering NSF-funded research projects with science education and outreach programs that can influence and attract the next generation of oceanographers.

In particular, the problem of polarity reversal remains elusive. Observation of field behavior (variations in direction and intensity) during reversals comes from laboratory analysis of the magnetic information fossilized in rocks at the time of their formation. The bulk of our knowledge about the structure of reversing fields has come from drilled core samples at locations in the Northern Hemisphere. Hence, a complete understanding of transitional field behavior on a global scale, and the dynamo process responsible, requires considerably more input from the Southern Hemisphere. Such is the focus of our study of an extensive sequence of Tertiary lavas from the Liverpool Volcano in eastern Australia, which is known to contain the record of an ancient field reversal at about 40 million years ago. Our goal is to obtain the most complete paleomagnetic documentation of polarity reversal recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, both with regard to the progression of directional swings, as well as the changes in field strength. In addition, we are using isotopic dating techniques to date the lavas in order to determine the precise age and duration of the reversal. Results from the project will be used to develop improved global models of dynamo reversal and to supply needed constraints for sophisticated computer simulation.<br/><br/>Studies of the geomagnetic field are important because it shields the Earth from harmful cosmic rays and provides the means for human and animal navigation. The field is decaying in strength at a rate that, if it were to continue, would vanish in less than 2000 years. If this occurred, it could signal the onset of an attempt by the dynamo to reverse polarity. Through our study of the Liverpool Australia Reversal we hope to better understand the nature of transitional magnetic field behavior, which has important implications for our understanding of the processes in the deep Earth's interior that give rise to the geomagnetic field. In addition to the scientific goals of the project, the research is supporting the training of undergraduate students at California State Polytechnic University, and is contributing to research infrastructure at the University of Wisconsin.

DREAM is a highly multifunctional protein that interacts with presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, acts as a transcriptional repressor for a number of genes including c-fos gene and prodynorphin gene in Ca2+ dependent manner, and interacts and modulates the activity of A-type of K+ channels. Understanding how calcium-induced conformational changes within EF-hand motifs of DREAM control the protein association to DNA target sequence and modulate the K+ channel activity requires determination of kinetics and energetics of conformational changes that are associated with the transition between apo- and calcium-loaded forms of DREAM as well characterization the impact of the Ca2+ binding on the DREAM equilibrium dynamics. The emphasis of this project is to probe conformational heterogeneity and dynamic motion of DREAM in apo- and Ca2+ bound state using time-resolved fluorescence and anisotropy techniques and to construct time-resolved thermodynamic profiles in terms of volume and enthalpy changes for Ca2+/Mg2+ binding to DREAM using sensitive photothermal beam deflection method in combination with caged calcium compounds that enable rapid increase in Ca2+ concentration. This study will thus determine the role of the individual EF-hands in the Ca2+ signal transductions, the mechanism of signal transduction between the C- and N-terminal domains as well as the role of N- and C-terminal helices in interaction between DREAM and effector proteins.<br/><br/>This project will provide multi-disciplinary educational opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, who will receive broad training in modern experimental biophysics and biochemical methods including protein chemistry. Students' work will be disseminated at national and regional meetings and students will co-author publications. The emphases will be on giving students hands on exposure to advanced topics in an effort to stimulate their interest in chemistry and biophysics. The effort to recruit and train female and minority students will continue with the goal to increase participation and retention of students that are underrepresented in sciences.
1002258	Towards a General Automatic Reasoning Framework for Networked Systems	ECCS	COMMS, CIRCUITS & SENS SYS	07/01/2010	06/23/2010	Huaiyu Dai	NC	North Carolina State University	Standard Grant	Chengshan Xiao	06/30/2015	$249,049.00		huaiyu_dai@ncsu.edu	CAMPUS BOX 7514	RALEIGH	NC	276957514	9195152444	ENG	7564		$0.00	ECCS-1002258<br/>Huaiyu Dai<br/>North Carolina State University<br/>Towards a General Automatic Reasoning Framework for Networked Systems <br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The objective of this research is to develop a general and flexible framework for automatic inference in networked systems that can admit wide applications and provide desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, while allowing simple and distributed implementation. Given that exact interference is generally intractable whereas the widely-adopted mean field approach is limited in inference quality, the approach of this research is to explore the structured variational methods to bridge the gap and allow flexible tradeoff among various potentially conflicting goals, which can be tuned according to the needs and available resources of applications. Various models, dependency structures, and inference algorithms will be considered in this variational inference framework, together with efficient distributed implementation. An associated research line is to design automatic clustering schemes that ideally can match the needs of inference tasks while being easy to implement in a distributed manner. The interaction between the clustering and inference layer will be explored to achieve better performance and adaptivity. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project contributes fundamental concepts, designs, analytical tools and software towards building a general and systematic framework for automatic reasoning in large-scale networked systems, such as sensor networks and cyber-physical systems. The expected outcome can be applied in diverse areas including security, transportation, medicine, energy, manufacturing and many others. Through suitable modification, the proposed distributed clustering algorithms also admit wide applications in various areas of network science and engineering. The multi-disciplinary nature of the proposed research also lends itself to cross-disciplinary education and well-rounded training of a future IT workforce. Special efforts are taken to encourage the participation of students from underrepresented groups. Various channels are pursued to disseminate research findings, developed software, and educational materials to industry and the broader public.

Olsen at Loyola University of Chicago for three summers, commencing in 2010. The site will support nine students per summer in a ten week program. The research projects focus on research in a wide number of areas in the chemical sciences. Sample projects include: (1) the synthesis and characterization of an improved hemoglobin polymer; (2) the study of the regulation of starch synthesis in bacteria and plants; (3) the synthesis of supramolecular structures for host-guest investigations; (4) the computational study of electronic structure and nuclear dynamics in electrocyclic reactions; (5) the study of DNA adducts formed with the water disinfection byproduct dibromonitromethane; (6) the study of charge injection in nanostructures; (7) the study of electron transfer processes in clays; (8) the computational study of complexes containing divalent metal cations; (9) a study of quorum quenching hydrolases in bacteria; and (10) a study of the ways in which lake breezes off of Lake Michigan process and transport atmospheric pollutants. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in site visits (e.g. the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory), and a variety of professional development activities. Students in the City Colleges of Chicago will be recruited, as well as other colleges in the region. Many of the schools in the area have large numbers of students from underrepresented groups. Students will be selected on the basis of their enthusiasm for research, intellectual curiosity and motivation.<br/><br/>Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide practical, hands-on research training to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity. The possible projects span a wide range of topics of current chemical research, giving the students working at Loyola University's REU site excellent examples of the kinds of research problems that chemical scientists investigate. Students participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce. The pool of student participants will diverse, and many will come from groups traditionally underrepresented in the chemical sciences.

This technology has its roots in on-board sensors in vehicles, global position systems (GPS) receivers, and algorithms/protocols for ad hoc networks, which enable vehicle-to-vehicle communications without infrastructure equipment (e.g., base stations in cellular systems). A fundamental yet open issue is addressed: how rapidly and efficiently can information be disseminated in a vehicular ad hoc network? To address the unique challenges presented by mobility-induced time dynamics, a complimentary approach of networking analysis and physical channel exploitation is employed.<br/><br/>The project focuses on three issues: (1) Development and analysis of new measures of connection times among vehicles in percolated VANETs, in contrast to traditional measures of network connectivity. (2) Exploration of the impact of fading-induced channel variation on network performance and development of new fading prediction-aided routing mechanisms that integrate adaptive transmission techniques, e.g. rate and relay selection. (3) Identification of the theoretical time limits of information dissemination and capacity-delay trade-offs when nodes move at high speeds and in highly dynamic vehicular networks. <br/><br/>As vehicular communications advance large-scale and social networks, this project addresses an acute and timely demand for exploring fundamental principles of mobility-induced channels and network dynamics, which have not been studied systematically, but have tremendous impact on routing protocol designs, optimization techniques for performance analysis and estimation, and modeling of network architecture and topology.
1042794	RAPID:Collaborative Research: Excavation of an Underwater Cavern Containing Primates, Other Extinct Vertebrates and Archaeological Remains in Hispaniola-- A Site Under Threat	BCS	Biological Anthropology	07/01/2010	06/18/2010	Richard Kay	NC	Duke University	Standard Grant	Carolyn Ehardt	06/30/2012	$14,648.00	Paul Baker	rfkay@duke.edu	2200 W. Main St, Suite 710	Durham	NC	277054010	9196843030	SBE	1392	7914, 1392	$0.00	A multidisciplinary survey of the Padre Nuestro cavern, southeastern Dominican Republic is the goal of this research. The cavern is underwater, but its floor was dry at the time of emplacement of extinct vertebrates and archaeological materials. Primates, rodents and sloths originated in South America and had arrived in the Antilles by the early Miocene, but absence of other typical Miocene South American taxa like carnivorous marsupials, armadillos, and notoungulates suggests that a connection between the continent and the islands were intermittent and subject to biotic or cross-water filters. Padre Nuestro contains thousands of loose bones on its floor that so far include many species of native cavioid rodents and several kinds of ground sloths. A skull of an Antillean primate has already been recovered and conserved. A particular emphasis will be the reassessment of the phylogenetic patterns of the primates and sloths using the new material because this contributes important information to the debate over the biogeographic origins of the Antillean fauna: did vertebrates arrive by a filter or via long-distance over-water sweepstakes dispersal and were there a single or multiple dispersal events? In addition, the cavern contains archaeological material that will improve knowledge of the timing and causes of extinction of sloths and primates in Hispaniola, in particular whether extinction was caused by climate change or was induced by the arrival of humans. If the archaeological remains can be shown to be autochthonous and undisturbed since the time of cave flooding, they represent an unusual insight about the culture of some of the earliest immigrants to the Antilles. <br/><br/>The improved phylogenetic analyses made possible by the recovery of more complete remains of primates and sloths will allow tests of hypotheses regarding how and when these mammals entered the Greater Antilles. Geochemical analyses will provide the first direct evidence about the local environmental conditions under which these vertebrates lived. The research also contributes significantly to the Museo del Hombre Dominican and assists in training of staff in the conservation of bone preserved under these circumstances. The research is part of the effort to strengthen the fragile status of archaeological and paleontological remains and provide further support for stronger protection measures of this and similar sites.

These have been particularly well-studied in insects, where seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) have been demonstrated to be key regulators of the reproductive success of both males and females. This project will identify SFPs in the red flour beetle, Tribiolium castaneum, which is a worldwide, economically important pest of many different stored grains. Using a powerful combination of chemical and genetic techniques, the investigators will determine the specific effect these seminal proteins have on Tribolium reproductive success. One approach will be to use RNA interference (or RNAi), in which Tribolium will be injected with double stranded RNA that matches the genes responsible for producing those proteins. Using this technique, the investigators will be able to effectively halt the translation of the mRNA that contain the instructions to build each seminal protein. By then evaluating the reproductive performance of these knockdown males, the role these proteins play in determining the reproductive success of this species will be revealed. This project has both theoretical and practical applications. By understanding how seminal fluid proteins affect the interplay between males and females for control over the fertilization of a female's eggs, a greater understanding will be gained of the evolutionary forces at work in male and female co-evolution. Additionally, this research may reveal novel approaches to help control the reproductive output of this economically important agricultural pest. This project will likely provide training opportunities for several undergraduate students.

The fossil record is a key source of information about how species responded to environmental change in the past. Fossil material from carnivorous mammals in southern California, dating to the Eocene and Oligocene epochs (56 - 23 million years ago), will be examined to learn more about the ecology of those species and how they may have been impacted by a changing environment. This material also will be compared to records from central Oregon to examine patterns of change in regional mammalian diversity at a time when there was a dramatic loss in flowering plant diversity. Together, these analyses will provide insights into the timing and magnitude of changes in mammalian diversity, and how the extent and timing of this loss of diversity compared for carnivorous and non-carnivorous mammals. <br/>To encourage more dialogues between paleontologists and conservation biologists, and to promote the irreplaceable value of paleontological collections in biodiversity research, the findings of this study will be disseminated through professional scientific meetings, undergraduate-level college courses, and museum tours and lectures for schoolchildren and the general public.

The basic technology is zeolites that contain nitric oxide, an agent that has proven effective in treating chronic wounds. However, since NO is a gas, NO delivery to the desired area is difficult. New products designed to maintain optimal levels of NO during the various phases of wound healing would be important solutions for enhanced healing of chronic wound. This project has two aims: a) prove efficacy of zeolites containing NO in improving healing in chronic wounds. This will be accomplished in animal models of impaired wound healing using non-invasive optics to monitor wound healing and b) develop a hydrogel that achieves controlled release of NO to the tissue.<br/><br/>The broader/commercial impacts of this research are significant: if successful, the product developed could reduce the estimated US healthcare costs of more than $10 billion annually associated with treating diabetic foot ulcers and related amputations. Furthermore, approximately 3.2 million Americans who are affected by leg ulcers would be provided with effective treatment. Recurrence rate of these ulcers is as high as 70% and the annual cost is estimated to be $3.5billion. Developing a commercial product that is cost effective and can be administered at any nursing care or wound care facility as a dressing will have a life altering impact on the quality of life for the patients and in reducing healthcare costs.

The intellectual objective of the RRM is to provide an inexpensive, high caliber, interdisciplinary meeting for RNA researchers in the Midwest. The field of RNA structure, function, and processing is growing at a rapid pace and RNA has been shown to be intimately involved in many important biological phenomena such as carcinogenesis and development beyond its obvious prominent role in transcription and translation. At the same time the methods used to study RNA are becoming more and more diverse ranging from synthetic and physical chemistry over biochemistry, genetics, and biophysical approaches all the way to computational methods. Consequently, research groups need a forum where they can hear and discuss new results and techniques in all areas of RNA research that can result in furthering an individual lab?s aims. The size and organization of the meeting has proven to be an excellent environment for active discussions between research groups, including those between principal investigators, principal investigators and trainees, as well as between trainees themselves. Such interactions are more difficult at larger national meetings. Due to the success and popularity of the RRM, this meeting includes research groups from Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and other adjoining states.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the RRM is in trainee and junior faculty development. The RRM strongly emphasizes trainee participation. The RRM features graduate and undergraduate student participation, from institutions ranging from large research-intensive universities to small, primarily undergraduate colleges. In addition to offering opportunities for interactions with Principal Investigators and other trainees, the RRM provides invaluable experience presenting research in an educational and supportive atmosphere. Importantly, trainees account for the vast majority (~ 90%) of both poster and oral presentations. Such presentations instill confidence in the trainees and inspire trainees in the audience to present their results orally in the future. To encourage the speakers further, prizes are awarded for outstanding trainee presentations. The smaller size of the RRM also benefits trainee poster presenters because of the greater attention paid to them by principal investigators. Finally, the RRM is an excellent forum for junior investigators to showcase their emerging research programs.

For example, the island of Taiwan emerged from the sea approximately five million years ago and, through colonization from various places, now contains thousands of unique plants and animals. This study will apply new analytical techniques to molecular genetic data to reconstruct the colonization histories of 24 bird species that are unique to Taiwan. The project will reveal how and when the bird fauna of an isolated island was assembled over evolutionary time and improve understanding of the historical development of the bird diversity seen today.<br/><br/>This project will advance understanding of the evolution of an isolated biota. It also will form the basis for an informal education program aimed at communicating the science of evolutionary biology to the bird-watching general public. The project also fosters new scientific and educational opportunities between students and researchers in Taiwan, Mainland China, and the USA.

At a time when academics in political science have been advocating multi-method research approaches that are strongly rooted in theory, this workshop brings together a variety of political science and social science approaches to social conflict and political conflict to examine the ongoing conflict system of the Middle East.<br/><br/>The workshop melds together academic approaches, methods and findings with policy oriented needs. It brings together conflict scholars, primarily from political science, applying a range of advanced, rigorous analytic and data gathering techniques, to address the single empirical domain of the contemporary Middle East conflict system. This multidisciplinary workshop demonstrates the complementarity between formal approaches and various empirical mtehods, and also notes the relevance of scholarly research to policy questions.<br/><br/>With regards to broader impacts, the results of the workshop will be of interest to policy makers dealing with conflict situations. In addition, a number of graduate students are invited to the workshop. They will have an opportunity to interact with the other participants as well as observe the development and use of multidisciplinary and multi-method approaches. It is hoped that these experiences will influence their later work.

Recent advances in organic photonic materials and their inclusion into novel device architectures suggests that these materials will play an important role in the next generation of EO switching devices for telecommunications and other applications. Although the promise of organics to provide enhanced EO activity, faster switching speeds, and at a lower cost relative to current materials has been recognized for some time, there are two issues that limit the wide-spread use of these materials: chromophore alignment and photostability. The studies are designed to provide insight into the molecular details underlying these issues, and with this insight strategies for enhanced material performance can be identified and pursued.<br/>Alignment in organic EO materials is studied by investigating the rotational dynamics of single-molecules as a function of external perturbation (in particular, electric field and temperature). EO activity arises at the ˜(2) level of material susceptibility which requires that the material non-centrosymmetric. Acentric order in these materials is introduced by poling, a process in which an external electric field interacts with the permanent dipole moment of the chromophore to (theoretically) restrict chromophore reorientation thus providing for material alignment. The molecular-level details of poling are poorly understood, and our recent studies have established that only modest alignment is achieved in this process. Furthermore, poling is generally performed 5 to 10∞ C below the glass transition temperature of the polymer host, but what do chromophore reorientational dynamics look like at these temperatures? What is the interplay between temperature, polymer relaxation, and poling-induced order? The single molecule studies will provide molecular-level insight into the poling process, and subsequently refinement of this process. Optical poling in binary chromophore organic glasses is also studied. Optical poling provides for a two-fold enhancement in EO activity relative to electric-field poling alone. Theory suggests that this enhancement arises from the optical field reducing the spatial dimensionality of the host. The team will measure the rotational dynamics of single molecule in the presence and absence of the optical poling field to directly test this hypothesis. The photostability of organic EO materials is investigated by measuring the time-dependent emission (blinking), spectral diffusion, and excited-state lifetimes of single molecules. Time-tagged, time-correlated single photon counting techniques are used to directly correlate blinking behavior to the underlying photophysics that result in population and depopulation of the non-emissive or dark state. The experiments are combined with Monte-Carlo simulations to identify these states which serve as a gateway to material photodecomposition. A unique aspect of this work is that the team will employ single molecule crystal isolation techniques to test vexing questions concerning molecular photophysics in complex environments, with the crystal providing a host where solvation is well-defined and controlled.<br/><br/>The advancement of fundamental knowledge will have impact on the fields of quantum information and of photonics. The graduate students directly involved in these studies will receive a multidisciplinary education in basic physics, materials science, and nanofabrication. The research, while fundamental in nature, is readily accessible to undergraduates and will benefit from the involvement of undergraduate students in the program. The fundamentals of optical absorption and emission provide unique opportunities for illustrating nanoscience to pre-Kindergarten through high school students. For example, the emission from visible quantum dots provides excellent visual demonstrations that will be used in the outreach activities of the PIs in high needs Buffalo Public Schools. This outreach will be enhanced significantly by the incorporation of a middle school science teacher in the PIs research activities during the summer. Simultaneously, this summer program will also enable the PIs to benefit from the experience of the teacher in the development of educational tools for use at the middle and high school levels. Finally, the PIs will organize a summer workshop for high school students to provide an introduction to the exciting research in nanoscience.

The conference will bring together researchers from North America, Europe, and Asia to present and discuss the latest multidisciplinary work on multimodal interfaces, systems, and applications. Now in its second year, the combined ICMI-MLMI is the foremost international event representing the growing interest in next-generation perceptive, adaptive and multimodal user interfaces. Such interfaces represent an emerging interdisciplinary research direction, involving spoken and natural language understanding, image processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, experimental psychology, etc. They aim to promote efficient and natural interaction and communication between computers and human users, and represent a radical departure from previous computing that should ultimately enable users to interact with computers using everyday skills. The main goals of ICMI-MLMI 20010 are to further scientific research within the broad field of multimodal interaction and systems, to focus on major trends and challenges, and to help identify a roadmap for future research and commercial success. Topics of interest this year include: multimodal and multimedia processing; multimodal input and output interfaces; multimodal applications; human interaction analysis and modeling; and multimodal data, evaluation, and standards. The three days of invited talks, panels, and single-track oral and poster presentations will facilitate interaction and discussion among researchers; the conference promises to be an international venue for brainstorming and coming up with creative directions for future research in multimodal interfaces. Participants in the Doctoral Consortium will get to showcase their ongoing thesis work, either orally or in a special doctoral spotlight poster session during which they will receive feedback from an invited committee composed of senior personnel, and including the Advisory Committee chair and the General and Program chairs. As a further incentive for high-quality student participation, ICMI-MLMI will be awarding outstanding paper awards, with a special category just for student papers. More information about ICMI-MLMI is available online at http://www.acm.org/icmi/2010.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Doctoral Consortium will give student participants exposure to their new research community, both by presenting their own work and by observing and interacting with established professionals in the field. It will encourage students at this critical time in their careers to begin building a social support network of peers and mentors. With the goal of increasing the breadth of participation at ICMIMLMI, selection of grantees will be done by the PI with oversight from the Advisory Committee Chair and the Conference General Chair; the organizers will make special efforts to encourage participation by a significant number of student researchers from less-well funded institutions, as well as by minority students, female students, and students from geographically under-represented states. Students funded under this award will all be enrolled at U.S. institutions of higher education.

The system will thereby detect emergent patterns and draw inferences about each consumer's behavior, preferences, and lifestyle for market research. The proposed data mining system would utilize state-of-the-art pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to dynamically process and interpret GPS data. The objectives of this proposal are, first, to develop and deploy a scalable, extensible database of collected and processed location data from opted-in mobile consumer devices, second, to develop a machine learning system to classify consumer behaviors, third, to develop a real-time visit detection engine that triggers an action based in part on an individual's dwell time within a geofenced zone, and fourth, to evaluate and refine this system by conducting a one-month pilot study with GPS data. If successful, this research will prove the feasibility of a system that can draw inferences about consumer behavior by analyzing semi-continuous GPS data.<br/><br/>Analysis of consumer behavior using electronically-derived location data can both supplement and contextualize existing market research methods, thereby providing quantitative actionable inferences to retailers and brands. If this research effort is successful, the proposed system would allow businesses to more efficiently and accurately conduct consumer-focused market research. Such a system would address a broad range of market research opportunities, from shopper loyalty research to store siting to marketing effectiveness measurements. Recent changes in the marketplace indicate that market and technology conditions are now favorable for the development of the proposed data mining system. Specifically, the accelerating penetration of GPS-equipped mobile phones is accompanied by a growing need for brands and retailers to more robustly justify marketing spend and business decisions by using verifiable analytics that go beyond self-reported survey data. Additional future impacts of the proposed effort include the ability to combine GPS-derived mobile consumer analytics with Geographic Information Systems for improved public safety, municipal planning and transit systems design.

The workshop will provide a vehicle for exploration and discussion of long-term barriers to sustainable buildings and the innovations required to overcome them. The workshop will focus on two broad areas of sustainability in buildings: (1) the materials used in the construction and operation of buildings and their systems and (2) the role of building materials on the energy required to maintain a comfortable, healthy, and productive indoor environment. In each area, the workshop will include emphases on the development of materials and systems as well as the models, theories, and data required to effectively analyze the long-term impact of sustainable buildings through life cycle assessment (LCA). The expected outcome of the two-day workshop will be a report that identifies needs and opportunities for innovation and describes research pathways to deliver on the promise of sustainable buildings. <br/><br/>The workshops will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by promoting collaborations among US academic institutions and international partnerships between institutions in Israel and the US. The workshop will engage researchers and educators from multiple disciplines in engineering and architecture, including researchers who have not traditionally worked in the field of sustainable buildings, and will disseminate its results to the diverse community through the conference website. Since building impose such a significant impact on the global environment, the research program for sustainable buildings developed by the workshop can have far-reaching benefits to society in the US, in Israel, and worldwide.

Furthermore, the racial, ethnic, and geographic diversity of students served by 2YCs make these institutions key entry points to STEM fields for students who have been historically underrepresented.  While 2YCs serve large numbers of STEM students, the number of NSF Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) proposals from and awards to these institutions remains disproportionately low.<br/><br/>This project is developing and implementing a grant writing workshop and mentoring program for STEM faculty from 2YCs.  Project components are designed to address the barriers to participation in CCLI faced by 2YC faculty and, as such, to address the disproportionately small number of CCLI awards made to these institutions.  The overall goals of the project are to broaden awareness of the CCLI program as a resource for 2YCs and to increase the number of CCLI awards to these institutions.  A specific focus of the project is on faculty from rural 2YCs that have not had previous NSF funding.   By enhancing participation of target faculty in the CCLI program, the project is directly impacting 2YC faculty and students through improved curricula, pedagogy, and instrumentation.  Furthermore, by broadening the CCLI community to include institutions not previously represented, the project is seeking to further facilitate collaboration between 2YCs and the broader undergraduate STEM community.

Although GM crops are cultivated widely, the environmental effects of this technology have not been thoroughly evaluated. Researchers at Portland State University are using genetically modified Bt corn to investigate how advances in plant biotechnology affect the important interactions between plants and symbiotic organisms in the soil environment. Transgenic Bt corn produces an insecticidal toxin that binds to soil particles and accumulates in the environment over time. Because soil microorganisms are critical for decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients, and forming symbiotic relationships with plants, it is important to determine the effects of transgenic crop production in the soil. Healthy plant-microbe interactions are known to stimulate plant growth, enhance water and nutrient availability, and help plants survive drought, disease, and nutrient stress. Any disruption in this symbiotic relationship is likely to have negative effects on overall soil and plant health, requiring additional chemical inputs to maintain productivity in these systems. This dissertation research will examine whether symbiotic plant-fungal relationships are reduced in transgenic Bt corn under field conditions and assess the effects of Bt crop production on the abundance and diversity of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soil ecosystem. <br/><br/>Although there are many benefits of using biotechnology in agriculture, such as reduced broad-spectrum pesticide use, little research has been done on the effects of transgenic crop production on symbiotic microorganisms in the soil. Examining non-target effects of GM crops on the soil community becomes even more important as transgenic crop acreage continues to increase globally. This research evaluates both the benefits and potential impacts of agricultural biotechnology on the soil environment with the goal of finding an acceptable balance between the use of genetically engineered crops and the preservation of a healthy soil ecosystem.

Specific themes include the organization of liquid crystalline materials using novel molecular shapes such as rigid triptycene units to enhance liquid crystal alignment. Similar organizational forces can be applied at surfaces and investigations focusing on large skeletal rearrangements caused by specific photochemical reactions will be used to create specific surface alignments. In the area of molecular semiconductors, investigations of the role of long-range and short-range order on the electronic transport properties will be performed. Different global alignments in devices seek to determine if combined Pt dz2 and p-orbital interactions can lead to high mobility in oriented soft crystal phases. Other investigations will focus on open-shell organic materials in liquid crystals. Polyradicals that are strongly electronically coupled intramolecularly will be interrogated to examine if magnetic ordering can play a role in electron transport (i.e. magnetoresistance). Complex polycyclic carbon network materials will be synthesized using Diels Alder reactions in an effort to create higher acene structures containing phenylene units and the synthesis of carbon nanotubes.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Molecular based electronic materials and associated technology is rapidly becoming part of everyday life. Presently, the impact of these technologies is limited by the intrinsic performance of the materials. This research will push forward new design paradigms that seek to produce materials with enhanced electronic transport. It will further develop materials having new types of electronic interactions that can lead to new physical phenomena that can be the basis of future technologies. The students trained in this effort will be prepared to contribute to this emerging industry. In addition, the PI will continue his efforts to create higher diversity in the workforce by continuing to promote and organize workshops that seek to empower the scientific careers of disadvantaged Americans.

Currently, the loss of force control limits the use of such nano-steppers in precision trajectory tracking applications. The research will solve the following controls-related challenges: (i) manage the applied force in each nanostepper without inducing unwanted vibrations due to actuator dynamics; and (ii) design the actuator recruitment (i.e., the number of active nanosteppers at different time instants) based on the required force level. Analysis methods will be developed to investigate the effect of the recruitment procedures on the stability and performance of closed-loop systems with the distributed nanostepper. Additionally, the proposed work will design and build a proof-of-concept distributed nanostepper, and the theoretical developments will be verified experimentally. <br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will improve the performance of nanopositioners used in research and development of nanosciences and nanotechnologies. Example applications include: probe positioning in scanning probe microscopy (SPM) and alignment of optical components in the opto-electronics industry. The proposed work will provide research-training and education to undergraduate and graduate students in nanotechnology. The proposed research will be introduced into undergraduate curriculum through mechatronics design projects in a senior-level capstone design class. Moreover, the resulting undergraduate projects will be used in outreach/recruitment activities in annual open houses for high-school students. Additionally, the research efforts will be disseminated through seminars, publications, and conferences. Thus, the proposed work will build the research and human resource infrastructure needed to remain competitive in high-tech and emerging-nanotechnology industries.

This QGP can be created by heating matter above a temperature of 170 millon electron volts. Experimentally, this is done by colliding two large nuclei (typically Gold or Lead) at very high energy. The resulting hot and dense fireball is expected to expand under its own pressure, and cool down. Properties of the QGP such as its temperature, pressure, chemical potential, viscosity, diffusion coefficient, speed of sound, etc. can be deduced from thousands of particles emitted from the fireball and detected with large scale particle detectors surrounding the interaction region. Such studies are being carried out in the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-ion Collider (RHIC) and planned for the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), respectively. This project is focused on a set of exclusive measurements that can establish the properties of the high-density matter created at RHIC via the PHENIX detector, as well as applying some of these measurement techniques at LHC using the ATLAS detector. Specifically, we will probe the properties of this matter via measurements of high-energy single jets and back-to-back jet pairs (di-jets). The research will improve our present understanding of the fundamental nature of the matter under extreme conditions, and therefore has a broad impact on other fields of endeavor such as astrophysics and super-string theories. <br/><br/>Participation by graduate students and undergraduate students is expected throughout the program. The PHENIX experiment provide a diverse array of research topics at all levels of education, as well as an excellent working environment involving interactions between hundreds of scientists in the field, and unique opportunities for career development in programming, hardware, leadership and academics.

The senior proposers will supervise this student in his study of coherent radio bursts as a diagnostic of magnetic energy release in solar flares. Under their guidance, the student will utilize state-of-the-art radio instrumentation to make fundamentally new observations of coherent bursts from flares, in the form of dynamic broadband imaging spectroscopy at decimeter wavelengths. These observations will allow the locations of flare magnetic energy release to be pinpointed, and the temporal and spatial evolution of these locations to be tracked. Depending on the particular type of radio burst, such observations can place constraints on the magnetic field and plasma density in and around the energy release sites of solar flares. <br/><br/>The new technique of broadband imaging spectroscopy at radio wavelengths promises to be transformative in solar physics. The proposers will exploit the newly upgraded instrumentation at the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA, a facility of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, or NRAO), as well as the Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR) Subsystem test bed array and the Owens Valley Solar Array, two university instruments operated by the New Jersey Institute of Technology at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory in California. <br/><br/>This project will directly support the education and training of a promising PhD student and will contribute to the successful commissioning of the EVLA radiotelescope. EVLA is an extraordinary and powerful new instrument that will dramatically enhance existing research infrastructure and transform our capabilities for radio observations of the Sun. EVLA will also support a broad user community and make possible scientific studies that will have direct impact on our understanding of space weather phenomena.

Based on the theoretical analysis, a new class of statistical inference tools will be proposed for robust estimation, dimension reduction, clustering and data summarization. Computationally effective algorithms will be designed and their software implementations will be disseminated. Besides theoretical development in statistical methodology, the proposed inference tools will be applied to climate change studies using satellite data and climate model outputs. <br/><br/>The proposed research is motivated by real world scientific problems that require statistical inference from massive datasets. The proposed method is designed to extract useful information and knowledge from those massive datasets with complicated structures. The novel algorithms to be developed in this project have the potential to not only help geoscientists and climate modelers in analyzing climate records and calibrating climate models, but also provide statistical tools for scientific investigations for researchers in a wide spectrum of disciplines.

The object of the project is to characterize the interface prior to and during device operation to gain insight into the relationships between interfacial molecular structure and function. It aims to advance the level of understanding not only in the fields of materials science and engineering where the devices are developed and tested, but also at the level of molecular design and synthesis by prescribing the features that need to be built into next generation molecules for efficient materials performance. The in-situ nature of experiments performed during organic field-effect transistor activation will provide a new perspective on the materials response from inside the functioning device, with the potential to describe not only what changes, but also what the timescales of change are and how these properties relate back to the macroscopic electrical response.<br/>Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The interdisciplinary nature of this project creates a training environment for undergraduate and graduate students, who are skilled in not only materials processing, but also electrical and spectroscopic techniques. The PI and his research team are actively involved in outreach activities. The PI, for example, is an active presenter on concepts of climate change for the FIRST LEGO League. These outreach activities not only seek to instill excitement about science in general, but to also make connections between the materials properties observed by the participants and the real-world technologies they are familiar with, such as plastic containers and cell phones.

A strongly polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming would be a breakthrough in complexity theory over the real field. It may lead to improved algorithms for harder types of<br/>convex programming (e.g., semidefinite) which (albeit in polynomial time) are currently prohibitively slow. Better algorithms for matrix preconditioning have the potentially to significantly improve linear algebra software packages.
