0508398	NER:  Signal Amplification in Biomolecular Detectors Using Activated Receptor Molecules	ECCS	NANOSCALE:  EXPLORATORY RSRCH	07/15/2005	07/11/2005	Cagri Savran	IN	Purdue University	Standard Grant	Rajinder P. Khosla	06/30/2006	$100,000.00	Rashid Bashir, Andrew Ellington	savran@purdue.edu	Young Hall	West Lafayette	IN	479072114	7654941055	ENG	1676	0000, 1676, OTHR	$0.00	The objective of this research is to increase the sensitivity of label-free biomolecular detectors to levels achieved by  label-based detectors (e.g. fluorescence) that are sensitive but time-consuming and costly. A method that improves sensitivity without modification of sensor structure or operation principle is highly desirable. The approach is to incorporate activated receptor molecules into biosensors. Single-stranded DNA or RNA-based molecules, namely aptazymes that perform enzyme activity upon binding to small targets will be used as receptor molecules. Accordingly, biosensors will detect the activity of relatively large aptazymes as opposed to directly detecting the binding of small target molecules. Since the activity will be triggered by small target molecules, they will be indirectly detected with greatly amplified sensitivity. The efficacy of the technique will be demonstrated on the surfaces of a few model label-free detection systems (both commercial and nanomechanical sensors built in-house) whereby small molecules whose direct binding would reveal signals too small to detect will be indirectly detected via aptazyme activity. All experimental work will be undertaken by Purdue. The aptazyme synthesis will be performed at the University of Texas at Austin. <br/><br/>This research project intends to make a broad impact on high-throughput detection of biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins and small molecules whose sensitive detection is of top importance for early diagnosis of many cancers that take 500,000 American lives every year. The findings of this project will be a significant step towards the development of fast, low-cost and high-resolution biomolecular detectors and towards the understanding of biomolecular interactions on solid surfaces. This project will also have significant educational contributions by setting an interdisciplinary stage where engineering students and chemists can interact and learn from each other. A part of the project will also be linked to a graduate level laboratory course.<br/>

Syntheses of the natural products arteanuinn B and arteanuin M will be used to explore the generality of the synthetic strategy employed in the construction of alliacol A, a synthesis of artemisolide will be used to probe the synthetic utility of Curtin-Hammett controlled cyclizations, a synthesis of ineleganolide will be used to study the utility of enediol initiating groups for the cyclizations, and a synthesis of dankasterone will be used to determine the compatibility of anodic cyclizations with electron-withdrawing groups on the initiating olefin. Efforts to expand the scope of the cyclization reactions will be pursued, tuning the reactivity of the radical cations so that they favor carbon - carbon bond formation in an effort to overcome the twin barriers of six-membered ring and quaternary carbon formation. Both electron-rich ketene acetals and enamines will be oxidized and the resulting radical cations trapped with allylsilane nucleophiles. Product analysis of the ensuing reactions will be used along with cyclic voltammetry to probe both the nature of radical cation intermediates and how their subsequent reactions can be manipulated.<br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kevin D. Moeller of the Department of Chemistry at Washington University.  Professor Moeller and his students will explore the use of electrical energy to induce selective reactions of organic molecules. Electrochemically mediated reaction sequences will be developed which allow the efficient synthesis of chosen organic molecules. Such organic electrochemical reactions offer promise as simple yet highly versatile tools for the construction of the complex target structures forming the basis of modern pharmaceutical research. Electrochemical methods also offer promise as potentially green (environmentally benign) approaches for organic synthesis.

The Continuum consists of a core curriculum of inquiry-based science and education courses for elementary education majors, with a bridge to lesson study communities of middle school science teachers in local schools.  The Continuum is intended to help teachers move from views of learning as the transmission of knowledge to views of learning as knowledge creation.  The PCxK framework extends research on pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) by linking intellectual transformations that inquiry-based approaches demand to transformed self-understandings that, if resisted, can block the change process.  The research team of university science and education faculty and veteran teachers is using quantitative and qualitative methods to examine different facets of teacher knowledge development through a study of several longitudinal cohorts of preservice, new, and experienced teachers as aggregate populations and through case studies.  This allows for comparisons among groups and individuals with different levels of participation in the Continuum and at different stages in their professional development.  The project seeks to understand how teachers' knowledge develops across inquiry learning experiences and how undergraduate learning experiences and the contexts of classroom practice shape new teachers' understandings and practice.  The study is expected to inform models of STEM teacher education that account for the interwoven intellectual and personal dimensions of the challenging transition to inquiry-based teaching.<br/><br/>

The aim of the program is to critically test aspects of recent theories on solvation that emphasize the importance of solvent expulsion around non-polar molecules (dewetting).  The results of these studies should help to explain a broad variety of important processes: from the formation of biological membranes to self-assembly, molecular recognition, chemical separation and environmental remediation.<br/><br/>Besides the broad impact of the research on several areas of science, Prof. Ben-Amotz will continue to provide his research students with excellent training in experimental as well as theoretical methods.<br/>
0506701	NIRT: Nanoscale Directed Self-Assembly in Electrical and Optical Fields	CBET	PARTICULATE &MULTIPHASE PROCES, NANOSCALE: INTRDISCPL RESRCH T	08/01/2005	04/06/2009	Norman Wagner	DE	University of Delaware	Standard Grant	 Ashok S.

In particular, solution-phase self-assembly, which is the biological route to creating functional nanostructures, promises scientifically and economically viable ways to develop industrial nanotechnology. Engineering micro-to-nanoscale devices and nanostructured materials requires control and understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of self-assembly of nanoscale building blocks in solution. This process is hierarchical in nature, so that molecular-level physics and chemistry lead to interaction potentials between nanoparticles and solvent molecules, which under the right conditions can assemble into higher-order structures on the nano-to-micron scale with emergent functionality. However, to harness self-assembly for man-made applications a high level of direction and control are required. We propose an integrated scientific and educational program to develop novel routes using directed selfassembly to manufacture nanoscale devices and advance the state of knowledge in the field of nanoscale manufacturing, including both rapid dissemination of our results and broader nanotechnology training.<br/><br/>Directed self-assembly is the application of external fields (i.e., electric, optical, and flow) to bias or modulate thermodynamic and mechanical driving forces in order to assemble large numbers of particles in parallel with high selectivity and precision. To advance this technology, we have created a partnership of five researchers from three universities who have complementary talents and skills that, in combination, can develop new and valuable approaches to understand and control the interactions between colloidal & nanometer scale building blocks, and then to manipulate those objects to form useful structures, devices, and prototypical nanoscale manufacturing schemes. Specifically, we propose a research program primarily designed to address the need to understand and control atomic and molecular interactions in nanoparticles and molecular assemblies to manufacture novel self-assembled microstructures with higher levels of functionality. Experimental techniques capable of controlling molecular-to-micron scale structure and dynamics will be developed, along with complementary theoretical modeling and simulations.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of our proposed research revolves around our integration of experiment, simulation, and theory to further develop and rigorously test fundamental understanding of directed self assembly at the nanoscale. For example, we propose specific experiments whereby patterned arrays of a few, model colloids will be held by optical tweezers while exposed to dielectrophoretic forces (ac electric fields). Parameter-free Stokesian Dynamics simulations will be compared on a particle-by-particle basis to test our understanding of the many-body electrostatic and hydrodynamic forces underlying dielectrophoretic directed assembly, thereby advancing our knowledge about the fundamental properties and processes that enable externally controlled assembly. The use of directing optical tweezers will enable direct measurements of the static and dynamic interactions between particles, providing powerful new particle characterization methods. Simulation, theory and experiment will drive toward the goal of assembling ever finer building blocks such that the methods can be applied to nanoparticles, and perhaps, even to proteins. Results of these investigations should facilitate the rational design, control, and optimization of manufacturing processes based on directed self-assembly, as well as the synthesis of new materials, such as photonic materials, nanoporous membranes, and biosensors. This work offers the potential for high reward because triggering, directing, and controlling the massively parallel, but highly selective assembly of nanoscale particles in solution or on to surfaces can create truly functional materials from colloid, macromolecular and nanoparticle building blocks of engineering significance.<br/><br/>Additional broader impacts of our work include the development of educational tools, workshops, and short courses. Short courses on particle science and nanoscale manufacturing techniques will be offered to students as well as to industrial researchers, along with new web-based teaching modules about directed self-assembly. The collaboration proposed herein also provides unique training for doctoral and undergraduate students to work in the field of nanotechnology, providing them with skills and background for rational, hierarchical design and fabrication. The outcome of the research will be primarily focused on enabling skills and techniques that can be used across a wide array of industries. An industrial partnership is proposed to facilitate the research and its practical applications.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses the themes of Nanoscale Structures, Novel Phenomena, and QuantumControl and Multi-scale, Multi-phenomena Theory, Modeling and Simulation at the Nanoscale.<br/><br/><br/>
0518308	Materials for the Investigation of Quantification in Passamaquoddy	BCS	LINGUISTICS	09/01/2005	09/18/2008	Benjamin Bruening	DE	University of Delaware	Continuing grant	Joan Maling	02/28/2010	$199,311.00		bruening@udel.edu	210 Hullihen Hall	Newark	DE	197162553	3028312136	SBE	1311	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	Expressions in language like everyone and no one and their counterparts in other languages, like tout le monde and ne...rien in French, have particularly interesting properties. Much research in linguistics has explored two questions: First, how young children learn these properties, and second, how much different languages vary from one another in these expressions and how much they have in common.  To answer the first question, researchers have designed clever experiments involving pictures, videos, and stories acted out with puppets; the results show interesting differences in how young children interpret these expressions as compared with adults. This research project aims to extend this methodology to answering the second question. These kinds of expressions are very difficult to investigate.  For instance, Someone likes everyone can mean two different things, but people generally have to think about it and consider different contexts in order to see both meanings (try it).  This fact becomes problematic in investigating an unfamiliar language, where the investigator cannot be sure exactly what language users mean or have in mind. This project will borrow pictures and videos from research on children and adapt them to investigating languages that are completely unlike English, starting with the Native American language Passamaquoddy, spoken by a small community in Maine.  Although this language differs extensively from languages like English and French, preliminary investigations indicate that, in expressions like everyone and no one, they have much in common.  The project will figure out how Passamaquoddy is the same as English and French, and how it differs.<br/><br/>The project has numerous broader implications: First, it will result in a set of materials that can be used by other researchers to investigate similar issues in other languages; second, it includes the participation of a minority group that is underrepresented in scientific research; third, this participation will help to change language attitudes among the Passamaquoddy community and encourage the use and revitalization of the language, which is in danger of dying out; and fourth, it will help to document a little-known language, one of many in the human heritage that are in danger of disappearing forever.<br/>

David<br/>TITLE: Integer Linear Algebra, LinBox Applications and Extensions<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>Linear algebra lies at the core of computation and modeling in science and engineering. Almost all of it done today is numeric linear algebra in which the data are measured values and the results are approximate and subject to varying amounts of error. This research addresses EXACT linear algebra computation in which the data are whole numbers and the results are exact - computed without any error whatsoever. In the past two decades, significant new methods have arisen and are enabling solution of large problem instances where it could not before be dreamed of. We will broaden the range of problem types solvable by the new methods, devise further new and better methods, and, above all, provide high performance implemented programs in a software library, LinBox, readily available to all. <br/>We will study (1) extremely sparse systems, with just a few nonzero entries per matrix row, (2) symmetric matrices: matrix signature and positive definiteness, (3) hybrid algorithms for Smith normal forms. The corresponding application areas are image rendering, study of symmetry (Lie groups), and combinatorics. The intellectual heart of the activity lies in two major areas. First, we probe the performance limits for sparse linear algebra, striving to create algorithms which are optimal, in the sense of computational complexity. This requires both novel algorithms and new insights concerning the absolute limits to speedup. Secondly, we program the library in a way providing for both high performance and genericity with respect to the many variants of matrix representation and underlying arithmetic. Thus the implementation elegantly solves the vexing problem of software reusability. The fact that our programs are not simply academic demonstrations is very important, giving the work much broader impact. Mathematicians and scientists may now use LinBox and for the first time perform exact linear algebra computations on large problems. <br/><br/>

Though there are existing scales that measure images of scientists, or attitudes about women, or ethnic/racial identity, none of these have been developed to address the intersections of gender and ethnicity/race with images and attitudes about STEM fields<br/><br/>Project activities are defined in pace and scope in a progression from local and exploratory tests, to a national validation study, then to public dissemination. In the first year, the team will collect 100+ items generated in local STEM focus groups and gleaned from existing scales, then pilot, tested and revise in large section local STEM courses to identify items that significantly contribute to key constructs. In the second year, the team will consolidate remaining items and distribute a refined survey instrument through a national network of cooperating faculty. The projected sample size is 10,000 student responses. Though a combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, analyses of a national data set (collected via online distribution and response) will identify a core STEM Scale and discipline-specific sub-scales, if and where disciplinary distinctions exist. In the third year, project activities are directed at disseminating information about the STEM scale and its psychometric properties, providing a field test of the scale in a discipline-specific setting, and fostering incorporation of the scale into research about factors influencing persistence, performance, and career commitment. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts.  Because attitudes related to gender and ethnicity/race (about self or others) have been associated with a wide range of inequalities in educational and career outcomes, the STEM Scale has applications as a basic tool in many areas of social research. The study will promote theory and research about the role of stereotypes in academic performance and persistence, and in career development and commitment, exploring the contribution of STEM course content to stereotype maintenance or disruption, and evaluating change over time in cultural images of STEM professions and professionals.

Cluster computing has become a common, cost-effective means of parallel computing. Although adding more CPUs increases the cluster's maximum processing power, real applications often can not efficiently use very large numbers of CPUs, due to lack of scalability. In regular codes the main impediment to achieving scalability is the communication overhead which increases as the number of CPUs increases. Most of these optimization methods proposed target specialized hardware or programming languages, and require specialized knowledge from the domain scientist, or are not enough to provide a comprehensive solution on their own, and do not adequately address the challenges of the layers of communication software between the sender processes and the receiver processes. Improved performance overall for these applications, it remains largely untapped due to (1) the need for the knowledge of the context of the communication operations to exploit the sophisticated network technology fully, and the (2) the low level nature of programming needed within the application program context to achieve that potential. In particular, performance can often be improved through increasing the use of lightweight asynchronous communication. Unfortunately, programming with asynchronous communication is difficult and error prone, even for the most experienced programmers.<br/><br/>The project will pursue a vertically integrated approach, where a set of optimizations in the compiler, network and operating system, can enable legacy parallel applications to scale to a much larger number of CPUs, even if written without any knowledge of our techniques. An experimental prototype and preliminary experiments with real scientific applications, show that significant performance improvements are possible with a vertically integrated approach where knowledge of the context of communication operations is joined with knowledge of the network and cluster details to provide a fine-grained strategy for overlapping communication and computation. Based on these initial promising results, the overall goal of this proposed research is to create a means for scalable cluster computing through enabling integrated knowledge and cooperation between the source optimizer, operating system, and network technology of the cluster, without relying on the programmer to learn about the low level details of the cluster communications system.<br/>

The research is employing both analytical and numerical methods and is focusing on pattern formation in systems where Brownian motion is not an adequate model for transport. Two types of nonstandard transport are being investigated, anomalous diffusion and transport with inertia. Anomalous diffusion, where the mean square displacement of a particle does not grow linearly with time, occurs in a wide variety of media, such as porous or fractal media, turbulent flows, and living cells. Another type of deviation from standard diffusive motion occurs in systems of particles where inertial effects in the transport cannot be neglected, as for example in dilute gases, turbulent flows, and the motion of microorganisms. Such systems can be modelled by reaction-transport equations. The research is determining the conditions for pattern-forming instabilities and elucidating the mechanisms of pattern selection. The research will in particular seek to identify phenomena where the behavior of reaction-transport systems differs qualitatively from that of reaction/diffusion systems. Such phenomena will allow an unambiguous experimental assessment of the importance of inertia or anomalous diffusion in applications.   The work is having a broader impact on other fields of science such as biology and geology where nonstandard diffusion occurs frequently.

Conventional practices, largely restricted to SPMD-based messagepassing programming models in the context of distributed memory, provide limited degree of system-wide application control but often prove inefficient and are difficult to program, debug, and tune performance for large complex problems. These challenges will only increase as clock speeds, memory densities, system scale, memory hierarchy, and problem complexity increase significantly throughout this decade to peta-flops scale before 2010.<br/><br/>This research project addresses the underlying sources of performance degradation (e.g. latency, overhead, and starvation) and the difficulties of programmer productivity (e.g. explicit locality management and scheduling, performance tuning, fragmented memory, and synchronous global barriers) to dramatically enhance the broad effectiveness of parallel processing for high end computing. The project will develop a hierarchical threaded virtual machine (HTVM) that includes a dynamic, multithreaded execution model and programming model, providing an architecture abstraction for HEC system software and tools development. The project will conduct research and development of a continuous compilation and runtime software technology that are critical to enable the dynamic adaptivity of the HEC system.   The research project addresses the underlying sources of performance degradation (e.g. latency, overhead, and starvation) and the difficulties of programmer productivity (e.g. explicit locality management and scheduling, performance scalability, load balancing efficient synchronization, etc.), and and will implement these methods in a novel framework of system software and tools to dramatically enhance the broad effectiveness of parallel processing for high end computing. <br/>

Clouds and precipitation affect our daily lives, personal safety, commercial decisions, and our future sustainability on Earth. Clouds and precipitation are important at all regional scales: local, state, national, and global. For example, clouds influence the daily maximum and minimum temperatures over our homes and they modulate the global temperature by affecting the amount of incoming solar radiation and outgoing longwave radiation. As the inhabitants of earth become increasingly concerned about global warming and climate change on global and regional levels, it is necessary to understand the roles of clouds and precipitation in the Earth System in order to predict the future state of our planet.<br/><br/>However, understanding and predicting atmospheric phenomena are very difficult tasks which require the measurement and modeling of properties on a wide variety of scales (cloud scale, storm scale, mesoscale, globally), fusion of computational model data, measured data, and the simultaneous fusion of hundreds of scalar and vector fields that vary over time. Current tools for atmospheric visualization are not capable of integrating these various data sources, communicating the complex three-dimensional, time-varying information necessary to accurately understand and predict atmospheric events, or for the integration of visual representations into the scientific analysis and discovery process. <br/><br/>This project will provide a fundamental advance in visualization and interaction techniques to solve these multiscale, multifield, data fusion, analysis, time-critical decision making, and interaction problems. These new multiscale, multifield, atmospheric visualization tools will: incorporate novel, effective, photorealistic and illustrative multifield visualization techniques; fuse observational and model data; improve the understanding of cloud dynamics, cloud evolution and precipitation formation; create effective multiscale visual representations; be rapidly deployed for research, training, and education; and produce an environment for actionable, comprehensive and efficient visual analysis. <br/><br/>Both computer science and atmospheric science research challenges addressed in this project will benefit other fields by: <br/><br/>1.

0417830	The Surface Structure and Reactivity of Mn-Oxides and Their Impact on As Transformation in the Environment: A Multi-Scale Approach	EAR	GEOBIOLOGY & LOW TEMP GEOCHEM	08/01/2005	07/26/2005	Donald Sparks	DE	University of Delaware	Standard Grant	Enriqueta Barrera	12/31/2006	$50,000.00	Michael Borda, Daniel Strongin	dlsparks@udel.edu	210 Hullihen Hall	Newark	DE	197162553	3028312136	GEO	7295	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	ABSTRACT<br/>Research is proposed that investigates the chemical and physical properties of the environmentally important oxides of manganese that play an important role in soil redox chemistry. It is well accepted in the soil science community that Mn-oxides exist as coatings and as discrete particles in soils, in part with nano-dimensions. Their rich redox chemistry affects the mobility and bioavailability of environmental toxins including many metals and metaloids. Research will be focused primarily on the surface structure and chemical reactivity of both the bulk birnessite (MnO2) phase of Mn-oxide and also a nano-MnOOH phase under a variety of environmentally relevant conditions. In particular, a selection of advanced surface spectroscopic techniques, including attenuated total reflection infrared and synchrotron-based photoelectron spectroscopy, will be used to develop a picture of the reacting Mn-oxide surface, such as determining the relative surface concentration of different oxidation states, over a range of established soil pH values. These Mn-oxide surfaces will then be probed via reaction with aqueous arsenic oxyanions to establish the control that differences in Mn-oxide structure and reactivity exert on the transformation of As3+ to As5+, one of the central As detoxification pathways in the environment.<br/>While birnessite, found in a wide range of soil environments, is a primary target of the proposed research, nanosized Mn-oxides also exist in the environment and are of interest in the current research. Toward developing an understanding of the role that nano-Mn-oxides might play in soil chemistry, research will investigate the reactivity and electronic structure of MnOOH nanoparticles as a function of size. Nano-MnOOH with homogeneous size distributions from 20 to 80  will be prepared and studied in solutions with varying pH and the As oxidation reaction will again be used as a probe for reactivity. This particular phase of the research project will not only develop an understanding of the size-reactivity relationship for Mn-oxide, but will in general contribute to the broader effort in geo- and soil chemical communities to evaluate the importance of nano-chemistry in the environment.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity <br/>The proposed study has a significant educational component. First, NSF funds will be used to support and train a postdoctoral associate at the University of Delaware and a graduate student at Temple University. Second, by virtue of this study being strongly interdisciplinary in nature, the scientific breadth of researchers in this project will benefit from the constant exchange of ideas and concepts between groups having expertise in diverse areas of soil and surface chemistry. This collaboration fits into the broader need for interdisciplinary studies to understand complex environmental chemistry. The studies will advance not only the frontiers of environmental geochemistry, but also provide important predictive information on contaminant transformations that will benefit society at large.<br/><br/>

Both matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization and chemical ionization will be used. At present, there is no suitable method for real-time detection and quantification of these species, making it difficult to study their formation and reactivity in either laboratory reactors or in the atmosphere. The analytical methodology developed in this work will be used to study the factors that control the polymerization reactions of lower molecular weight precursors in secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The chemical composition of SOA, its relative contribution to carbonaceous fine particulate matter, and its ultimate environmental impact will be investigated. Graduate and undergraduate students will be educated in this interdisciplinary research area involving chemistry and atmospheric sciences. <br/>This project will provide answers to critical questions about global climate.  Current atmospheric models do not account for polymerization.  As a consequence, it is likely that current global estimates of SOA are too low, and the effect of SOA on global climate is underestimated. The methodology is also relevant to bioaerosol characterization for homeland security applications.<br/><br/>

Nodulated, nitrogen-fixing legumes produce bioavailable nitrogen, one characteristic that makes legumes second only to the cereals in their importance to human nutrition.  Development of Symbiotic nitrogen fixing root nodule is a complex process requiring coordination of both the plant host and rhizobial symbionts' differentiation pathways.  In previous collaborative work between the Dickstein and Sherrier laboratories, two Medicago truncatula plant mutants, nip (numerous infections with polyphenolics) and sli (sluggish infections) that are defective in the rhizobial infection/invasion process were identified and partially characterized. The current work seeks to define the molecular and cellular defect underpinning these observed nodule mutations. The intellectual merits of tbe project include (1) cell biological analyses of mutants to facilitate the map-based cloning of the nip gene, and (2) characterization of sli with cell biological approaches. The broader impacts of the project include examination of important aspects of the basic biology of nodule development, infection thread growth and symbiosome formation, which have previously been difficult to study.  The results of this research might lead to new strategies to improve the efficiency of nodulation and nitrogen fixation.  Other broader impacts include the training of a postdoctoral fellow, graduate students, and undergraduate students.  Additionally, both Drs. Dickstein and Sherrier's groups are involved in several outreach programs at their respective universities that recruit non-mainstream undergraduate students, underrepresented minority undergraduate students, high school teachers in the summer, and high school students to work in their respective laboratories.  <br/>

His research provides conceptual frameworks for understanding folding in confined volumes, RNA folding, and chaperonin-mediated folding. The research team is focusing their efforts in three areas. (1) In the first area, the use of model systems and peptides and molecular dynamics to decipher the unfolding action of denaturants is being explored. (2) In the second project, the team is assessing the effects of confinement in nanopores and crowding, while carrying out calculations that probe the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding using minimal off-lattice models. (3) Finally, using off-lattice models for the substrate proteins and a coarse-grained description for the GroEL cavity the PI is  addressing the question of how the GroEL nanomachine aids in the folding of a large number of structurally unrelated proteins.

In the conventional sense, frequency regulation in power systems is obtained mainly by use of governor response of synchronous generators. This work develops new methodologies to take advantage of several new technologies in order to prevent cascading outages. These technologies include the use of a novel power electronics interface associated with distributed energy resources (DER), such as, wind power, as well as superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) to optimize DER response. The research will address with coordinating the location and operation of the DER with the SMES unit(s) coupled with controlled separation, if necessary, to maintain frequency balance and stable voltage profile in the system. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Market forces, such as deregulation and competition continue to push the margins of stability and reliability, and, even though enabling technologies, such as power electronics and storage are well understood, their deployment in power networks has not reached the level required to produce an impact. This research will optimize the impact of distributed generation and storage so that new technology concepts as well their integration will move forward in unison. Broader Impacts: This work seeks to improve the reliability of electric energy supply which has a direct benefit to society in terms of minimizing the cost of power outages. The study also lays the foundation of a framework for an updated power engineering curriculum for educating future engineers who understand the value of non-conventional generation and storage. The PI will organize a workshop for the local PES chapter so that practicing engineers can benefit from research outcomes.<br/><br/>

There is a pressing need to better understand these processes, in order to predict and mitigate the effects of anticipated changes in the global climate and environment. This requires an increased observational and experimental capability with respect to atmospheric transport and atmosphere-ocean exchange processes - an imperative has been recognized in the emergence of research initiatives such as the Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS), GEOTRACES, and the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). <br/><br/>Bermuda has been a key sampling and observational location for a number of important studies of the marine atmosphere, by virtue of its location in the western North Atlantic, where the atmosphere is impacted by emissions from North America, Europe, North Africa and the surrounding ocean. Bermuda is now well equipped for such studies, with a 23-m high atmospheric sampling tower and site laboratories that were established at Tudor Hill, on the southwest coast of the island, during the NSF-AEROCE program (1987-1998).<br/><br/>Under this award, researchers at the Bermuda Biological Station for Research will receive funding to maintain and operate this valuable facility for use by the research community beyond August 2005. With this support they will: (1) maintain a state-of-the-art atmospheric sampling facility at Tudor Hill, Bermuda; (2) collect, archive and make freely available meteorological data and selected core atmospheric samples (weekly bulk aerosols and rainwater) for use by other researchers; and (3) provide the opportunity for the collection of additional atmospheric samples and data for other investigators, and for use of the facility by other investigators. They will assess modest facility-user fees for the collection of samples or data in addition to the weekly core sampling, or other uses of the facilities. The anticipated net revenue from these user fees over the project period (ca. $10,000-15,000 per year) will be used to defray the costs of additional technician support, maintenance and equipment replacement for the tower facility. <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, the continued operation of the Tudor Hill tower will facilitate a wide variety of ocean-atmosphere research, which is expected to further our knowledge of the Earth system and to improve our ability to predict and mitigate the effects of future environmental change. Within a regional context, the Bermuda tower will form part of an ocean observatory network in the Sargasso Sea, along with ongoing ocean time-series programs including Hydrostation S, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS), the Bermuda Testbed Mooring Program, and the Oceanic Flux Program. Together, these observational programs promise an unprecedented understanding of oceanic and atmospheric processes. This project is expected to make significant educational contributions at a number of levels. Data and samples collected during our renewal project will be made available for use in graduate research projects, as they have been used during our current award. The Tudor Hill facility will also provide opportunities for undergraduate education, through use in BBSR's NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, and in lecture materials for undergraduate courses that are offered at BBSR. Descriptions of the research carried out at the Tudor Hill facility will continue to be used in BBSR's public outreach activities, such as public lectures, annual open-house day, and on the internet via the BBSR web site.  <br/>

Santa Barbara<br/><br/>This project aims at the development of a hybrid structural health monitoring and management of civil and mechanical structures through Integrated Sensing module for  Monitoring, Decision-Making, Model Management, and Control.<br/><br/>Such modules provide the ability of assessing the health condition of structures at both global and local levels, and offers improved performance over traditional methods focused on either level. One objective is to develop reliable global damage detection and identification methods. The structure will be modeled as integration of several subsystems. By monitoring the change in the dynamic behavior within each subsystem, the region of damage can be located at the subsystem level. Another objective involves the development of local damage detection methods. The novel sensing technique using ultrasonic infrared imaging will be adopted and continuously developed in this study.<br/><br/> The final objective is to propose that these two methods, global and local, interact in a mutually complimentary manner during real time monitoring process to assure optimal monitoring and management results, including the determination of exact location and characterization of damage and accounting for the effects from unknown environmental conditions.<br/>

This will allow investigation of a number of seismogenic zone processes.  One of the most exciting recent discoveries in the solid earth sciences is the occurrence of silent slip or aseismic creep events at subduction zones. The physical processes responsible for these events are not well understood; detection and study of their behavior at several locations is important. Aseismic creep episodes have been observed prior to the occurrence of large earthquakes and therefore may have important implications for earthquake hazard. Creep episodes perturb the surrounding stress field and their occurrence at the down dip edge of the seismogenic zone could bring the megathrust closer to failure. These stress increases are small, however if the fault is close to failure aseismic creep could trigger a large earthquake.<br/><br/>Relative to other subduction zones, Nicoya has a big advantage for this type of project: the peninsula is quite close to the trench.  Instruments deployed here are essentially perched directly over the locked part of the plate boundary, enabling high-resolution study of plate boundary strain and seismic processes.  The correlation between deep episodic creep and low frequency tremor, recently uncovered at the Cascadia subduction zone, could be significant in deciphering the key physical processes. The project is an international collaboration with scientists from Costa Rica. Germany, Japan and the United States.

A striking example is the transformation <br/>from magnetism into superconductivity which will be the focus of this <br/>project.  Experiments are planned to measure a quantity called the magnetic <br/>penetration depth, whose behavior provides a window into the microscopic <br/>behavior of electrons in the superconducting state.   This work will build <br/>upon novel techniques previously developed in this lab to measure the <br/>penetration depth.

The subject becomes increasingly important as the world, as well as national security threats, become more mobile.  This project is investigating the issues related to the design and development of innovative methods for querying, analyzing, and mining of spatiotemporal information to find typical characteristics of the moving objects' trajectories, and uncover suspicious motion in large datasets of moving objects.  The moving objects datasets are in the form of either stored data or transient data streams.  The project is designing and implementing the MotionEye system prototype which consists of four subsystems: MotionQuest(DB) and MotionQuest(Stream) for querying and hypothesis validation in moving objects databases and data streams respectively, and MotionMine(DB) and MotionMine(Stream) for data mining in moving objects databases and data streams respectively. The project is investigating efficient and effective approaches to the implementation of these subsystems.  The project is also striving to ensure that the developed technology will not sacrifice individual privacy.  The project will enable the development of more advanced information systems in homeland security, law enforcement, traffic control, and other domains that deal with moving objects.

The two main debates concerning gait in early fossil humans are over (1) the nature of their bipedal, upright walking gait (whether it was modern human-like or a gait with bent hips and knees), and (2) whether or not climbing and moving in trees remained an important part of the ecological behavior of these early species.  Over the last decade, many researchers have acknowledged that these debates have reached an impasse, and that a resolution will require new kinds of data regarding fossil evidence of functional activity during life.  Advances in imaging and analysis now permit researchers to capture and quantify the three dimensional (3D) structure of trabecular bone - the bone tissue most sensitive to loading history - in fossils and provide the kinds of evidence of joint loading during life needed to move beyond this impasse.<br/> The primary goals of this research are to examine the relationships between 3D trabecular structure and metacarpal (hand) and femoral (hip and knee) joint functions in higher primates.  More specifically, this research aims to (1) establish the relationships between trabecular bone architecture and habitual joint posture in modern higher primates that differ in their manner of gait (e.g., involving more flexed or extended joints), (2) examine the relationships between trabecular bone characteristics of the joint and cross-sectional strength of the bone shaft.  Establishing the nature of the relationship between habitual joint function and the structure of trabecular bone within the joint will then allow researchers to more accurately reconstruct gait in fossil species.  This project will apply its findings to one hypothesis about functional behavior in fossils, namely whether Neanderthals used their hands in ways that differed from those of modern humans.  This research entails the most comprehensive analysis to date of higher primate trabecular bone structure.<br/> This research also has several important broader impacts.  The scans obtained in this research will be made publicly available to foster additional research.  At least one doctoral student will gain training from this project.  It will help to develop a new approach to behavioral reconstruction that will be of interest to paleontologists outside of anthropology.  Finally, this proposal will foster interdisciplinary research between a geologist and two physical anthropologists, and international collaboration between researchers in the U.S. and Japan.<br/>
0457291	Painleve Equations	DMS	ANALYSIS PROGRAM	07/01/2005	07/06/2005	Aimo Hinkkanen	IL	University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign	Standard Grant	Joe W.

These equations are second order nonlinear differential <br/>equations whose solutions  do not have so-called movable singularities and cannot be expressed in terms of  elementary or special functions. Their importance arises from the  connections of the Painleve property to integrability theory,  as well as from the numerous applications of the solutions,  the Painleve transcendents.  In this project, the principal investigator will study the following aspects of  Painleve-related analysis: order of growth of single-valued meromorphic solutions; value distribution and branching of solutions to Painleve equations; and<br/>Painleve-type equations which admit movable branch points but only those whose multiplicity is bounded by a preassigned constant. Work performed under this proposal will lead to a greater understanding of and concrete results for this class of differential equations.<br/><br/>Painleve equations are of great importance in pure and applied mathematics  as well as in<br/>the applications of mathematics to other sciences and to engineering.  Within mathematics,<br/>Painleve equations are being applied in differential geometry,  random matrix models, and integrability. The following are examples of areas of current activity outside mathematics in which Painleve equations have been found useful and have arisen in a natural way: <br/>the Ising model in physics,  statistical mechanics in elasticity, correlation functions in an <br/>antiferromagnet model,  quantum field theory and  topological field theory,<br/>general relativity and cosmology, supersymmetry gauge theories in physics,<br/>resonant oscillations in shallow water, Hele-Shaw problems in viscous fluids,<br/>plasma physics, superconductivity, nonlinear optics and fiber optics,<br/>polymers, polyelectrolytes, and colloids. This list alone provides a clear indication of the empowering impact of  mathematics in science and engineering, and of the value that theoretical <br/>understanding and precise problem solving in mathematics can contribute <br/>to modeling and theory building in other sciences.  This project will provide additional knowledge and methods  to this area of wide applicability.<br/>

A promising new approach for addressing some of these problems is provided by library generators. Although all library generators have much in common, there is currently little code reuse in their implementation. This project will develop an infrastructure, called Proteus to generate highly optimized libraries for four important problem domains: dense linear algebra, sorting, data mining, and network packet processing. The platforms of interst for these environments include sequential processors with deep memory hierarchies, multi-core systems that provide small-scale shared-memory parallelism, and custom network processors.<br/><br/>Research advances on several fronts are required to make Proteus a reality: a simple domain language for linear algebra in the proposal and appropriate DSL's for data mining and network packet processing. Once domain-specific optimizations are done, the programs will be translated into a lower-level language called the X language, to be developed under the project,  that will represent in a compact way the search space as well as the strategy for adapting the code to the hardware. Proteus will contain tools for gathering information about the target machine, for guiding the selection process either statically or dynamically, for implementing domain-independent optimizations of the X code, and for generating C code as the final output.<br/><br/>The Proteus infrastructure will enable rapid prototyping of library generators for different domains. The libraries that will beproduced in the four different domains will be useful and interesting in their own right. In addition,  tools will be developed for gathering information about the target machines and the computing environment, can be used by themselves in other projects.<br/>

Integrated nanotransport systems are miniaturized chips containing large-scale integrated network of channels. Integrated nanotransport systems have the potential to not only revolutionize chemical and biological processing but also impact other application areas such as memory and storage, sensing, nanomanufacturing, and biomimetics. In the area of chemical and biological processing, integrated nanotransport systems, compared to conventional systems, are attractive as they require reduced consumption of samples and reagents and can provide much shorter analysis times, greater sensitivity, and portability that allows in situ and real-time analysis and disposability. Currently, integrated nanotransport systems are designed using a trial-and-error experimental approach. The design process and a proper understanding of the fundamental issues in nanotransport systems can be greatly improved with insight from theory and computational modeling.<br/>The objective of this research is to establish the computational foundations and to develop computational design tools to accelerate the design of integrated nanotransport systems. Specifically, the aims of this research are to (i) develop computational tools employing hierarchical physical models (e.g. quantum-mechanical, atomistic and classical models) to understand fundamental issues governing fluid and ion transport through a single nanochannel; (ii) develop bio-inspired channel designs using the computational tools developed as part of this research; (iii) extract compact, circuit or reduced-order models from detailed single channel analysis as well as from appropriate simplifications of the theoretical models describing nanotransport; (iv) use the circuit models to develop system level simulation tools for analysis of large arrays of channels and integrated systems. The system level design tools will be used to design integrated nanotransport systems for chemical and biological analysis and other interesting applications. <br/>The proposed research is at the cross-roads of several engineering and science disciplines. As a result, the development of computational design tools for integrated nanotransport systems will impact several disciplines and application areas. The main efforts of this project will result in the education of graduate students in the highly interdisciplinary area of nanotransport systems. Other educational activities planned as part of this project include the training of undergraduate students and incorporation of research results from this project into summer schools offered at UIUC.<br/>

One subject of ongoing research (partly joint with M. Christ) is the mapping properties of Generalized Radon Transforms -- a vast class of averaging operators over lower dimensional submanifolds. Satisfactory results in some cases have been obtained by the PI, via the application of techniques developed by Bourgain, Wolff, and others for the Kakeya problem. Generalized Radon transforms are still poorly understood, except in special cases, and Kakeya-related methods have a great deal more to offer. Understanding generalized Radon transforms is an important ingredient in the analysis of summability of multi-dimensional Fourier nseries and integrals, of more general oscillatory integrals, and of linear and nonlinear wave equations.  Other related problems, including the Fourier restriction phenomenon and issues in Geometric Measure Theory such as the packing of submanifolds into Euclidean space, will also be investigated.<br/><br/>Fourier analysis has always found wide applications in natural sciences and engineering.<br/>It underlies a powerful and diverse array of tools currently widely used in applications, and offers the promise of further applications in the future.  The proposed research deals with foundational issues which may ultimately help to underpin such future applications.  Summability theory of multi-dimensional Fourier series and related oscillatory integral problems are irreplaceable tools in the study of a wide class of PDEs, in which the current state of knowledge is incomplete. The proposed research will contribute to the general understanding of these problems.  The planned research is related to certain discrete problems of interest in Combinatorics and Number Theory, which in most cases remain wide open.

This project will carry out a one hundred square degree multi-band optical survey of the southern sky, in conjunction with even deeper images of smaller fields, coordinated with a millimeter-wave survey that will map the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to detect galaxy clusters out to moderate redshifts.  These coordinated surveys will enable the most precise cosmological study to date with galaxy clusters, and will enable complementary studies of the dark energy using supernova distances, cosmic shear, and the galaxy power spectrum.  This research will use the NSF-supported Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, and the privately supported Magellan telescope, both operational in Chile, and the CMB data will come from the NSF-funded South Pole Telescope, currently under construction.<br/><br/>The key science question of the dark energy has already engaged significant public interest.  This research will leverage the scientific productivity of multiple NSF-funded facilities, break new ground in real-time image analysis and observing optimization, directly benefit future large surveys currently in the planning stages, and continue a tradition of graduate and undergraduate student participation.

A common feature of many of these new developments is the miniaturization of hardware.  To continue the trend of miniaturization in many emerging technologies, the behavior of materials at an increasingly smaller length scale needs to be harnessed. This research project is to address the fundamental scientific and technical issues associated with deformation and failure of thin-layered materials, in particular the dislocation activities in confined, thin metal films.  In this study, experimental techniques that enable loading of small-scale specimens will be developed. TEM combined with FIB specimen fabrication will be used to determine the dislocation configurations and their evolution in confined metal thin layers.  The effects of dislocations on interface adhesion and interfacial crack propagation are evaluated by measuring interfacial fracture toughness. Discrete dislocation dynamics simulations are conducted to identify critical conditions, including critical dislocation patterns and interface properties, for interfacial failure. NON-TECHNICAL: This study will significantly enhance the fundamental knowledge on dislocation nucleation and patterning in thin-layered material systems, enhance the understanding of the effects of dislocation activities on interfacial adhesion and crack propagation, and help identify the dominant mechanisms of failure in thin-layered materials. Such fundamental understanding will have significant impact on product design and development in microelectronics and MEMS industry.  The project also contains a comprehensive scholar exchange and educational plan. The scholar exchange plan includes regular research meetings by phone and via the Internet, and annual mutual visits between the PI and the German collaborator at the Max Planck Institute in Stuttgart, Germany. Furthermore, the PI and the German researcher will co-advise U.S. and German graduate students working on the project so that the students are exposed to research activities at both U.S. and German institutions. Such international exchange activities serve the broader objective of training and producing a new generation of engineering students with not only solid knowledge in materials science and engineering, but also extensive international experiences.

How  efficiently to represent, classify, and analyze a large quantity of  high-dimensional data that have complex geometric or statistical  structures becomes one of the most fundamental and challenging  problems in our modern information-technology era. One of the main  difficulties with modeling complex data is that a given data set may  consist of many different components (subsets), each of which may  have different topological, geometric or statistical structures. In  different contexts, such data are called mixed, or multi-modal  <br/>or piecewise, or heterogeneous,or hybrid.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed project is to investigate a novel approach  that models hybrid data as algebraic sets instead. This readily  relates the hybrid-model estimation problem with the study of  algebraic sets in algebraic geometry. It offers rather refreshing  technical tools, different from the conventional statistical learning  methods, which can help resolve the apparent chicken-and-egg  problem in the estimation of hybrid models as well as lead to  efficient and robust algorithms for estimating and decomposing hybrid  <br/>models.<br/><br/>In the past few years, hybrid model estimation has become a  fundamental problem in many important applications, ranging from  image/video/motion segmentation in computer vision, sparse image  <br/>representation and approximation in image processing, to hybrid  system identification in systems theory. The proposed  interdisciplinary research project provides ample opportunities for  students from both mathematics and engineering to interact with each  other. Engineering students are traditionally weaker in training in  abstract algebra than in analysis, geometry, and statistics. This  project will significantly improve the visibility of algebraic  geometry to engineering students and researchers. It will help to  <br/>develop new cross-discipline research programs between mathematics  and engineering. Furthermore, visual examples and demonstrations  developed from this project will also enhance the teaching of  abstract algebraic concepts to undergraduate mathematical students or  even to the general public.<br/>

Indeed, while message-passing (iterative) processing is very successful in practice, understanding its limitations and its sources of non-optimal behavior has been elusive. Despite the enormous impact that message-passing  algorithms have, in particular in a communication scenario, practical systems currently rely almost exclusively on a simulation-based evaluation. In this situation, understanding the behavior and geometry of message-passing will not only reduce the necessity of simulations but provide powerful tools for system optimization.<br/><br/>This proposal draws on recent exciting developments that connect message-passing algorithms to the well established theory of convex optimization. As it turns out, message-passing algorithms are intimately related to a linear programming formulation of the inference task at hand. In fact, belief propagation algorithms may be interpreted as an efficient duality-based method to closely approximate the solution to a linear program. Once such connections are established the investigators will strive to understand message-passing algorithms from an entirely new and fruitful point of view. Also, the investigators have already shown that the connection to convex optimization is rooted in the basic property of message-passing algorithms, namely that they operate only locally in a given graphical model. Thus the findings resulting from the approach investigated here will apply to any reasonable locally-operating algorithm.<br/>

Unfortunately, this gas is mostly molecular hydrogen, which does not radiate easily, and so observations must rely on tracer molecules that are more easily detected, the commonest of which is carbon monoxide (CO).  However, in the most energetic regions, changes in cloud chemistry mean that other molecules may be better tracers.  Single-dish spectra of nearby starburst galaxies show that global chemical differences among galaxies can be significant, which calls into question the use of CO, or, indeed, any other single molecule as a tracer of molecular clouds and gas mass.  This project will focus on the chemical properties of the centers of the closest spiral galaxies, where giant molecular clouds can be resolved in line images, studying at least seven molecules and looking for correlations, trying to find simple characterizations of the cloud chemistry.<br/><br/>This work on the chemical imaging of galaxies is the first of its kind.  In addition to revealing the astrophysical environments in these galaxies, this research may place constraints on individual chemical reactions, identifying gas-phase and gas-grain chemistry, and working towards the study of many, much more distant, galaxies with future millimeter array instruments.

A first INTERDROUGHT meeting held a decade ago brought together a range of expertise to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying drought sensitiity and tolerance, explore practical avenues for improving crop performance in drought-prone environments, and to address issues related to the socio-economic environment interfacing with such practices.  Considering the particularly steep increase in knowledge at the molecular level over the last decade, an International conference focussing on all aspects of drought is overdue.  INTERDROUGHT II has now been organized to foster interdisciplinary work and harness the understanding coming from plant genomics work for a more holistic view on how to integrate such knowledge in existing breeding programs. <br/>Great advances have been made in recent years in understanding the molecular basis of plant response and tolerance to drought stress. Scores of drought-responsive genes have been identified and the function of some has been resolved.  The availability of whole genome sequences for Arabidopsis and rice, and increasingly more information about the genomes of other plant species, together with massive sequencing of drought-induced genes and the analysis of the expression profile of entire genomes has provided further opportunities to identify candidate genes whose manipulation either through engineering and/or marker-assisted selection will likely be instrumental for hastening future improvements in drought tolerance. <br/>The objectives of INTERDROUGHT-II are (1) to serve as a platform for presenting and debating key issues and strategies relevant for increasing the yield and stability of crops under drought conditions by genetic and management approaches; (2) to assess ways to fill the knowledge gap between the molecular level and the field level; (3) devise strategies to more effectivley deploy scientific knowledge to release more water-use efficient and drought-resilient cultivars and to more efficiently manage water resources. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit and Impact. <br/>There is now an increasing demand in both public and private sectors for interchange between disciplines involved with molecular science and those involved with crop management in the field. INTERDROUGHT-II offers a unique and timely platform for this exchange. Although the major emphasis of INTERDROUGHT-II lies in the scientific forefront of molecular genetics, plant breeding and management practices, socio-economic issues have been addressed in the program. <br/>INTERDROUGHT-II will be especially concerned with the poorer, less-developed countries that confront an escalating problem of increasing food production with less water and on marginal, drought-prone land. The conference will strive to address such problems with appropriate participation of experts and students from developing countries.  We expect  >400 people from all continents to attend, many of them young and upcoming scientists, and stakeholders (e.g., NGOs, NARI, CGIAR, etc.) will be present, providing a platform for enhanced outreach. <br/>The support from NSF will be used to partially cover travel costs and/or  accomodations for young US scientists, advertized through plant/crop science society webpages. Special emphasis will be placed on supporting young reseachers interested in and working on drought-related topics at Colleges that transmit research results to farming and indigenous communities. Drought is a planet-wide problem, solutions are global, research networking is essential - it is equally essential to provide, as our funding allocation will do, minorities the opportunity to attend ID-II.  <br/><br/>

However, most studies have concentrated on regeneration strategies related to sexual reproduction, neglecting the contribution of vegetative propagation Even though it has been recognized that a variety of tropical plant species have the potential to reproduce vegetatively, the actual frequency of different modes of reproduction in natural populations remains unknown. Vegetative reproduction can be a particularly important regeneration pathway for small-seeded understory species that have low recruitment success from seeds. The primary goal of this proposal is to determine the relative role that vegetative reproduction plays in the regeneration of species of tropical understory shrubs, and to evaluate the consequences of this mode of reproduction in terms of genetic diversity and mating opportunities. Plants will be mapped and similarities among their genetic fingerprints will be used to distinguish the clones from the genetically distinct individuals in the field. Combining the genetic and the spatial data I will be able to determine dispersion of clones and the frequency of establishment by sexual and vegetative reproduction in the population. This study will improve our understanding of tropical ecology in areas such as colonization, recruitment, gene flow, and population demography and genetics.   The support of this grant will provide training in molecular techniques for a Panamanian woman scientist. Furthermore, the database of genetic information, with the geographic locations of individual plants will be made available to the research community to address a myriad of ecological and evolutionary questions, where knowledge of the genotypes and genetic relationships among plants is essential.

Its adverse effects include noise, poor surface finish, reduced dimensional accuracy, and shortened machine tool life.  The onset of chatter limits material-removal rates and productivity.  The purpose of this project is to clarify the mechanism of suppression of chatter through continuous modulation of spindle speed.  The project addresses this issue using a combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental efforts, bridging the gap from the one-degree-of-freedom turning model to realistic models for high-speed milling processes.  The unifying theme in the work is a study of the nonlinear delay differential equations that govern the tool motion.<br/><br/>It is planned to transfer to industry innovative theory and simulations developed in the project, allowing improved design and greater performance of various material removal processes.  The project will develop web-based simulators to be used in senior undergraduate and graduate courses and to provide industrial designers with a predictive tool to avoid unwanted machine behavior.  These graphical tools will enhance understanding of the effect of noise and fluctuating time delay on real engineering problems.  The project provides an excellent environment for student education through research at the interface of applied mathematics and engineering.<br/>

This has contributed to it becoming the most popular National Park in the United States with nearly 10 million visitors each year.  The GSMNP comprises more than half a million acres and is one of the richest biological areas in the northern-hemisphere temperate zone, serving as a refuge for a diversity of life forms.  An intensive effort by numerous scientists to document the Park's exceptional biodiversity, known as the All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory (ATBI), is currently underway.  Fungi represent one of the Park's largest and most important components of biodiversity and must be surveyed to accomplish an accurate and thorough ATBI.  Pyrenomycetes, which often occur as small, inconspicuous parasites or saprobes on plants and plant products, comprise a large group within the Fungi.  This study will focus on the wood-inhabiting pyrenomycetes, which form an integral part of all ecosystems since they are intimately involved with such basic processes as nutrient cycling and decomposition of organic matter.  Information on the species diversity, systematics, and biogeography of pyrenomycetes is fragmentary, and surveys in most areas of the world are critically needed.  An intensive inventory of the wood-inhabiting pyrenomycetes at sites throughout all five major forest types within the GSMNP is proposed to document their diversity, distribution, abundance, seasonality, and host specificity, thereby furthering our understanding of their biology.<br/> This study will generate numerous products available to a broad range of users as both hardcopy and web-based.  The publication of resulting specimen databases, online species pages, and an interactive identification system will greatly assist future studies of temperate pyrenomycetes.  In addition, identification guides depicting the various taxa found throughout GSMNP will be produced to supplement web-based resources.  This project will train a post-doctoral research assistant, a doctoral graduate student, several undergraduate students, and various amateur mycologists and volunteers in the taxonomy and ecology of a wide range of pyrenomycetes.  Finally, every unique pyrenomycete taxon will be sequenced for the entire nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, which is commonly used in the identification of fungal species.  These sequences will be made available to the scientific community through public databases where they will play an essential role in future ecological, systematic, biogeographical, pathological, and biological control studies.  This will be the first attempt intensively to survey the diversity of pyrenomycetes in North America and should serve as a model for future studies in the Park as well as other temperate areas of the world.  Documenting what species occur within GSMNP is a critical first step to understanding the functions of the Park's ecosystems and translating this information into management decisions.<br/><br/>

The problems of light propagation through such devices are closely related to the design of delay lines, optical buffering devices. Due to small scales of those devices and wave nature of the light signals, the accuracy of the numerical methods, especially the phase accuracy of the numerical methods, is critical in obtaining the speed and phase information of light signals through photonic devices.  <br/>The development of algorithms for modeling of microphotonics such as resonant waveguides will result in advanced capabilities in solving linear and nonlinear Maxwell equations in inhomogeneous media for a wide range of engineering problems. The potential technology applications of this research will provide integration of optical elements on a single chip, to control velocity of light, to provide routing and switching functionality on a micro-scale by incorporating nonlinear optical material into the microspheres/microcylinders. These are the fundamental questions being addressed in the research communities of modern photonics. The major challenge will be the development of highly accurate and efficient numerical algorithms for the solution of linear and nonlinear Maxwell equations in layered and inhomogeneous media. The following topics will be studied: (a) Discontinuous spectral element methods for time dependent nonlinear Maxwell equations, (b) Upwinding Embedded Boundary Methods, (c) Modeling with the developed algorithms for coupled resonator optical waveguide devices.<br/>As a main goal of this proposal, we plan to find solutions to the current bottleneck problems in the designing of coupled resonator waveguides with significant impact on the development of next generation optical technologies. This includes optimization of the nanometric separation between microspheres or microcylinders to achieve a trade-off between reduced group velocity of light (desirable property for optoelectronic applications) and reduced efficiency of optical transport. This also includes understanding of the role of the size disorder existing in the presently available ensembles of microspheres and microcylinders. The results of this proposal will be directly implemented into the manufacturing of photonic devices of coupled microspheres or microcylinders in our laboratory. In addition, publicly available codes will be created for calculating of all types of optical spectra (transmission, reflection and scattering) and photonic band structures of coupled resonator waveguides.     <br/>One graduate student will conduct research toward a Ph.D. degree in either optics or/and applied mathematics, and his/her participation will contribute to the educational components of the newly established Center of Optoelectronics and Optical Communications at the UNC Charlotte.  Research results from this proposal, in the area of new physics and mathematical modeling tools, will be incorporated into the optics curriculum now under development at the Center, potential technology transfer of the results to the area optics industrial will be explored through the existing partnership between the Center and area optics companies. The PIs will also actively participate in the Center's technology training programs with the area high schools. <br/>

The goal is to create an integrated new facility at the University of Miami that will combine the latest technology for the rapid and automated measurement of sediment/rock geochemical, optical, and petrophysical properties. The suite of new instruments, when combined with existing wet chemical analytical facilities, will allow for comprehensive, in-house, one-stop study of sediment and rock cores from marine, lake and wetland sites. The instruments we proposed include: (1) an Avaatech X-Ray Fluorescence Core Scanner to be used for the rapid and non-invasive elemental analysis of split sediment cores; (2) a GEOTEK Multi-Sensor Core Logger equipped with color line-scan camera system to be used for the digital imaging and direct physical property measurement of both whole and split rock and sediment cores; and (3) a replacement X-Ray Diffractometer that is needed for the quantitative determination of mineralogy. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>The proposed equipment acquisition would contribute significantly to an active sedimentary research group at the University of Miami, and to other universities in the South Florida area.  On a national scale, the instruments would contribute to a significant improvement over existing US capabilities in paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental research. The equipment will be used for graduate and undergraduate student training.  <br/>

This will allow investigation of a number of seismogenic zone processes.  One of the most exciting recent discoveries in the solid earth sciences is the occurrence of silent slip or aseismic creep events at subduction zones. The physical processes responsible for these events are not well understood; detection and study of their behavior at several locations is important. Aseismic creep episodes have been observed prior to the occurrence of large earthquakes and therefore may have important implications for earthquake hazard. Creep episodes perturb the surrounding stress field and their occurrence at the down dip edge of the seismogenic zone could bring the megathrust closer to failure. These stress increases are small, however if the fault is close to failure aseismic creep could trigger a large earthquake.<br/><br/>Relative to other subduction zones, Nicoya has a big advantage for this type of project: the peninsula is quite close to the trench.  Instruments deployed here are essentially perched directly over the locked part of the plate boundary, enabling high-resolution study of plate boundary strain and seismic processes.  The correlation between deep episodic creep and low frequency tremor, recently uncovered at the Cascadia subduction zone, could be significant in deciphering the key physical processes. The project is an international collaboration with scientists from Costa Rica. Germany, Japan and the United States.

Geckos have an amazing ability to climb up and down vertical dry walls effortlessly. Recent investigations revealed the secret of uniquely structured Seta hairs on gecko's palms. The keratinous seta fibers are composed of hundreds of finer nano-structured spatulas. This unique structure allows a gecko to use efficient van der Waals forces to make its dry hands sticky. In this proposed program fundamental understandings and manufacturing technologies to fabricate synthetic Gecko skin structures will be researched. The approach is through systematic analysis of the artificial gecko foot hairs in terms of material properties and structural parameters of the nano-patterned polymer surface. Nanoimprinting and Synthetic chemistry are the tools to achieve the nanopatterned polymer surfaces with designed engineering properties, which enables strong but reversible adhesive surfaces. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/><br/>The main components of the proposed research project cover several disciplines of science and engineering including molecular design, synthesis, and nano-fabrication. The results may lead to new biomimetic nanostructures with economic significance. The research will be integrated into a strong educational effort including graduate student training, curriculum development, and undergraduate student research opportunity. This interdisciplinary project will involve students from both material science and electrical engineering departments. The results obtained will be incorporated to graduate level courses on nanotechnology and biomaterials. In addition, synthetic gecko tapes for in-class demonstration will be developed as effective educational tools for the K-12 teachers and students to experience the emerging nano-bio science. <br/><br/>

The Indigenous Earth Sciences Project has the dual goals of increasing on-reservation expertise in the Earth and environmental sciences and developing a better understanding of how to most productively and appropriately integrate culturally-held, indigenous, scientific Earth science knowledge into the teaching of the Earth sciences in American Indian communities.  Partners in this collaboration include San Diego State University, regional Native American reservation communities and the high schools and educational programs that serve these communities.  This project has formally united cooperating programs in adult education, a well established middle- and high-school to college bridge program operated by and for local tribal communities, high-school science departments, and an early outreach program in outdoor science for younger children.  Together these programs have combined into a complete and culturally responsive recruitment and retention pipeline.  Many local Native American children participate in our Explorers Clubs outdoor science programs, learning to understand and enjoy the connections between their environment, culture and science.  We have seen many of these children grow up and move on into the Young Native Scholars high school to college bridge program.  With cooperatively designed high school curricula based in local issues and the local geological setting, students become well prepared for college science and aware of career options in the Earth sciences.  All efforts are augmented by project-supported work experience for participating students in tribal environmental management offices on their home reservations.  Students continue to San Diego State University Geological Sciences for B.S. and M.S. degrees, and join the growing ranks of local Native Americans educated by the department who return to work and live in their home communities, helping complete the cycle and grow the next generation of Native American geoscientists.  This project has produced and continues to produce insights into best practices in Native American geoscience education, adding unique information to the growing body of research into the best approaches to the inclusion of all under-represented groups in the earth science enterprise.<br/>

In this context, understanding the failure behavior of particulate composites at both micro- and macro-scales is central to the design and reliability of mechanical members made of these materials.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: An investigation into the fracture behavior of polymeric heterogeneous materials with micron size fillers under static and dynamic loading conditions is proposed. Present literature on the topic is generally limited to quasi-static studies and the proposed work will address much needed understanding of potential loading rate effects on fracture behavior of this class of materials.  The research will focus on the interplay between filler particle size and volume fraction on the effective fracture toughness of materials under low- and high-strain rates of loading.  The work will be limited to micron size fillers and will include aspects of material processing, macro- (optical and/or strain gage measurements) and micro- (SEM, surface profilers) measurements and phenomenological modeling of the fracture process.  <br/><br/> Educational Aspects: On the educational front, the proposed research will be used to partially support a graduate student in an integrated learning program involving materials processing, mechanical and optical characterization of materials and modeling.  Original research from the program will be disseminated through archival journal publications, presentations at focussed symposia and world-wide-web.  <br/>

Reflecting these expectations, the Accreditation Board for Engineering Education (ABET) has defined a set of accreditation criteria (3a-k) which identify 11 outcomes expected of engineering graduates.  The Laboratory for Innovative Technology and Engineering Education (LITEE) team at Auburn University obtained funding from the NSF and, working with industrial partners, has developed multimedia case studies to address these expectations.  These case studies make it possible for students to visualize the problem posed in the case study and work in teams as they play the roles of concerned engineers and managers.  In class presentations, students present solutions to the problem and defend them.  Evaluation data shows that implementing LITEE case studies in classrooms improves the higher-level cognitive skills of students, stimulates teamwork, and satisfies the majority of the ABET 3a-k criteria.  Experience gained from disseminating the case studies through the earlier NSF CCLI grants, as well as reports from others, shows that there are many significant challenges in introducing multimedia case studies into engineering classrooms.  Some of the challenges are: changes in the role of the instructor, apprehension about using innovative materials, difficulties in evaluating and testing students, and training students to engage in effective team work.  The goals of this project will be to provide faculty members with hands-on experience of working in teams, explain case study teaching strategies, connect STEM theories to the real-world problems discussed in the case studies, and demonstrate how the LITEE case studies can help meet the ABET accreditation criteria.  <br/> <br/>A partnership with a group of 17 engineering/technology faculty members and 1 high school teacher, 2 experts in engineering education, and a few industry engineers/managers has been formed.  These partners will play a key role in validating the concept and value of disseminating LITEE case studies to students and training other faculty members.  In this project, the partners will work with LITEE through a national conference and two regional workshops.  One outcome of the project is that about 25 of the faculty members will adapt and implement LITEE case studies in their classrooms.  The second outcome of the project will be to bring real-world problems to classrooms and thus stimulate interest to pursue engineering education for over 750 students. This project will improve the way students learn important STEM principles by integrating soft and hard skills, provide students with real-life, comprehensive experiences in engineering, make the curriculum more interesting, and enable engineering educators to successfully meet many of the ABET accreditation criteria.  <br/><br/>

In particular, the investigator will explore (1) wave front dynamics in diffusive random and inhomogeneous media arising in phase transitions, nerve pulse propagation, population genetics, and cellular neural networks; (2) spectra and Lyapunov exponents for nonautonomous and random linear parabolic equations, with applications to uniform persistence and coexistence in competitive systems; and (3) global dynamics in stochastically forced oscillators, including Josephson junctions in superconducting circuits.  The project involves extension of classical notions in differential equations and dynamical systems as well as the development and implementation of new tools and techniques for the study of the problems in the project.  The results of the project will enhance the understanding of the dynamics of the systems under investigation, will provide theoretical and methodological foundations for the further study of these systems and related ones, and will bring closer together three separate, but related, branches of mathematics: differential equations, topological dynamical systems, and metric dynamical systems, enriching each of them.<br/><br/>Realistic physical and biological systems are influenced by variations in the external environment, and are often situated in anisotropic or inhomogeneous media.  For this reason, the study of such systems via models involving nonautonomous or random or stochastic differential equations has been gaining more and more attention.  Due to a lack of general methodology and difficulties in generalizing classical concepts and notions, there is still little understanding of many of these equations.  The investigator will extend relevant classical concepts and notions and develop new tools and techniques to study the dynamics of these equations.  The results of the project will provide deep insight into the effects of random external influences and inhomogeneity of media on the dynamics in models of physical and biological problems including phase transitions, nerve pulse propagation, population dynamics, cellular neural networks, pattern formation, and superconducting circuits.  The project will provide graduate students training in the area and will create opportunities for students to interact with scientists from other disciplines.<br/>

Novel applications are under development that employ microscale sensors and devices that enhance and enable more efficient and effective health care, environmental monitoring, telecommunications, in-flight aircraft condition monitoring, munitions guidance, etc. These include biosensors for monitoring public health threats and medical diagnostics, massively parallel reactor arrays for DNA expression, highly efficient and large Q-factor mechanical switches for tunable capacitors, photonic networks, digitally controlled radio, and wireless communication. A major issue hindering these technologies from rapid deployment to the marketplace is the evaluation of their robustness and reliability. These issues have been recently highlighted by several trade magazines and other periodicals, which generally state that the commercialization of microscale sensors and devices is hindered by a lack of fundamental understanding of material failure mechanisms of their microsized components.<br/><br/> In this project the investigator will focus on understanding how the microstructure of a thin film material and its evolution control the performance and reliability of engineering components that employ them. Tensile specimens with dimensions on the order of typical microscale components will be fabricated using standard semiconductor micromachining techniques. Specimens will be made of materials commonly used in microscale devices; namely, gold, nickel, copper, aluminum, platinum and silver. A new technique, called the membrane deflection experiment, will be employed to subject the specimens to uniform tensile stress. This will be combined with characterization by state-of-the-art high-resolution field emission electron microscopy, including electron backscattered diffraction that enables the individual crystal orientations of grains as small as 50 nm in diameter to be obtained. Finally, this data will be integrated with numerical simulations to facilitate the development of computational tools that enables engineers to predict the deformation and failure behavior of thin film materials.<br/><br/>By this method a fundamental model will be generated that examines the contribution of various mechanisms responsible for deformation and failure of thin film metallic materials. The model will enable engineers to realistically predict how thin films behave as well as promote the design of devices that take advantage of this knowledge for enhanced reliability and/or functionality.<br/><br/>

The investigators develop a new framework for an appearance-based analysis of imaged objects in terms of their shapes and textures using methods and tools derived from differential geometry and statistics.  A statistical formulation is of the essence due to the large variability of shapes and textures frequently encountered in imagery of interest.  The use of differential geometric methods in image processing is still incipient, but very promising, as solid evidence exists that such methodology is particularly well suited for the study of multidimensional, nonlinear features such as shapes and textures.<br/><br/>In recent years, the investigators have developed a statistical shape analysis program; shapes are viewed as elements of a shape space whose geometry is exploited for shape analysis.  The investigators treat textures in a similar manner by creating a Riemannian manifold of textures and integrate both representations into a single shape-texture model for the algorithmic analysis of image content.  Images are decomposed into their spectral components and local spectral histograms are treated as elements of an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold equipped with a geometric structure induced by non-parametric Fisher information.  Differential geometric constructs are utilized to develop algorithms for: (i) statistical inferences and learning of shape-texture features; (ii) Bayesian detection and recognition of objects using shape-texture priors; (iii) dimensionality reduction techniques for efficient processing.<br/>

Three new reactions, using allylic halides, alkyl halides and epoxides as alternative electrophilic partners, will be studied in detail to evaluate their scope and limitations. Tandem processes linked to the MBH reaction, and the use of vinyl carbene complexes in the MBH reaction will combine to enhance the synthetic utility of the proposed research.<br/><br/>With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Marie E. Krafft of the Department of Chemistry at Florida State University. Professor Krafft and her students are developing novel methods for the construction of organic molecules through the use of reactions that unite three reactants to form a single more complex product. These multicomponent reactions are mediated by organic catalysts, obviating the need for use of metal-containing catalysts, and offer promise in the design of new synthetic strategies towards targets of synthetic and medicinal value.

A systematic study of three dimensional chemical waves in a variant of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction is being carried out to test theoretical predictions of interesting scroll waves rotating around circular filaments and other complex wave dynamics. These new experiments are significantly expanding the number of experimental studies of this important reaction thought to be a model for excitable media in biological systems, such as cardiac and neural tissue. Steinbock's research group is devising new experiemental strategies that will allow the controlled fabrication of heterogeneous three dimensional systems that may mimic the heterogeneities found in biological tissue. Cardiac tissue, in particular, is suggested to have the same type of dynamical properties as the BZ medium, so broader impacts are expected in the understanding of sudden cardiac death, shown in prior theoretical studies to be related to the filament dynamics to be studied here.

Many biological disciplines rely for their data primarily on observations of appropriately prepared specimens. A few examples include comparative anatomy, histology, morphological phylogenetics, and taxonomic research. The need for access to suitable specimens constitutes a significant hurdle to rapid progress in these disciplines. However, in many cases data of comparable quality can be generated from photographs of the specimens instead of from the specimens themselves. The development of fast Internet connections and the availability of low-cost high-quality digital imaging techniques is currently revolutionizing research and teaching in these disciplines, and recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of 2D- and 3D-image databases of biological specimens on the web. MorphBank (www.morphbank.net), not to be confused with MorphoBank, is a searchable web repository of images for comparative morphology and biodiversity research, originally conceived by a consortium of Swedish, Spanish and American systematic entomologists. It currently contains about 6,000 images documenting morphological phylogenetics analyses, newly described taxa, and voucher specimens tied to GenBank sequences. MorphBank has been open to the user community for uploading of images since early 2003 and works well as a searchable image archive. The next steps in the development of specimen image databases focus on three projects, each exemplifying one important use case for such databases: (1) large phylogenetics projects; (2) remote annotation of natural history collections; and (3) comparative histology projects. The interdisciplinary research team, which includes biologists, computer scientists, a mathematician, and information retrieval specialists, will develop general technology that can easily be adapted to address the specific needs of each of these use cases, facilitating the incorporation of additional use cases in the future. In particular, the team will develop community annotation technology, making it possible for researchers to link their observations to specific images, without compromising the original image, and enabling their colleagues to search, process and comment on these annotations. The team will also develop the MorphBank user interface including a new image-handling client, develop networking technology to support database functionality, substantially revise and refine the table structure, and implement more sophisticated data filtering and backup technologies. Finally, the team aims to build an international network of institutions supporting MorphBank or MorphBank-compatible image databases and to spur the development of international standards for biological image databases. The MorphBank project provides ample opportunities for supporting educational and outreach activities through its open access to biological images and associated information.

RNA is a copy of DNA, but unlike the typical DNA double helix, the RNA copy of each gene forms a unique three-dimensional shape that strongly influences its behavior, including how it interacts with proteins. This project uses x-ray crystallography and other biochemical tools to learn the three-dimensional structure of complexes comprised of bulge-helix-bulge RNA and protein. The bulge-helix-bulge RNA structure specifically binds to a protein enzyme called the splicing endonuclease, leading to breakage of chemical bonds at two specific locations of the RNA. This cellular process is an obligatory step required to maturate RNA molecules, much like the way movie films are edited. The goal is to delineate the chemical principles involved in the association of RNA with multiple forms of the splicing endonuclease and the subsequent endonuclease-catalyzed RNA cleavage reaction. Results obtained from this research will broaden the knowledge base of essential cellular processes and enhance classroom teaching of both biochemistry and molecular biology. This project will also provide ample research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students.

The family's fossil history extends to 90 million years ago, prior to most fragmentation events in Gondwana, and the subfamily's far-flung distribution in the Southern Hemisphere (on all major Gondwanan fragments) is generally explained by rafting of ancestors on those fragments. The subfamily is particularly diverse in Australia.  It contains 3 of that continent's 10 largest flowering plant genera; Grevillea is third largest (behind Eucalyptus and Acacia), and Banksia has that continent's most extensive fossil record.  The subfamily is also a major component of the diverse flora occupying Australia's open, fire-swept vegetation - a vegetation type that expanded substantially after Australia's post-Gondwana isolation.  However, despite the significance, we are still without a well-resolved phylogeny (family tree) for the subfamily. The proposed research by Dr Austin Mast at Florida State University, with colleagues Peter Weston and Greg Jordan in Australia and David Cantrill in Sweden, will (1) construct a backbone phylogeny for subfamily Grevilleoideae, relying upon nuclear and chloroplast gene sequence data for 200 or so species; (2) construct fine-scale phylogenies for 8 focal groups of biogeographical, ecological, and paleobotanical significance; (3) improve subfamily classification and circumscriptions of genera, subtribes, and tribes; (4) test the effects of the break-up of Gondwana on the subfamily using the many replicate disjunctions (at least 6 between Australasia and South America) within the context of known fossils; (5) test the effects of widespread aridification on ecological diversification in the Australian members; and (6) test the chronology of at least 6 replicate disjunctions between Australia's diverse Southwest Botanic Province and eastern coastal areas, separated by Australia's central deserts.  <br/>The project will provide a robust phylogenetic framework for a significant portion of the Proteaceae, and thereby contribute to studies of the origin of Gondwanan and of amphitropical (Northern and Southern hemisphere) disjunctions.  The PI maintains an online relational database for the family that stores information about researchers and growers, currently recognized scientific names, images, news items, and links.  This project will expand the database to include a literature table with out-of-print texts, a taxonomic synonyms table, a geographic distribution table, a fossil taxa table, and graphics to communicate phylogenetic results and changes in taxonomic delimitations. The results of the research will be summarized in both scientific and layperson's terms. The site is broadly useful to researchers, commercial and hobby growers, educators, and students.  The project will train one graduate and two undergraduate students in modern systematic techniques and strengthen scientific collaborations with scientists in Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Fiji, and Vanuatu.<br/><br/>

These part defects include incomplete filling by the infiltrant and localized infiltrant over-extrusion onto the surface of the part at surface irregularities.  The approach is threefold.  First, wetting theory will be extended to this problem and will establish a basis for defect origin.  Second, guided by this scientific advance, a process will be created to remove and/or mitigate defects observed previously in silicon infiltrated silicon carbide parts.  Last, the results of this scientific assessment will be verified by applying them to different part geometries that promote defect formation and to different materials systems including cobalt infiltrated tungsten carbide and epoxy infiltrated graphite.<br/><br/>If successful, these research results will enable development and maturing of a new manufacturing route for creating low-cost non-metallic parts with complex geometry and excellent surface finish.  Included are commercially important hard-to-process materials such as cobalt-tungsten carbide, silicon-silicon carbide and graphite-graphite.  This will strengthen the domestic manufacturing infrastructure and enable domestic manufacturing to compete more effectively in the world market.

One of these newly-recognized hazards is fire. The formal investigation of the collapse of the World Trade Center (FEMA 2002) identified a number of critical concerns within the engineering community because insufficient information was available to predict the response of structures during a fire. Engineers need to conduct more research to understand how structural components and systems behave at elevated temperatures. The equipment requested in this proposal will be an important resource for meeting the basic research needs.<br/><br/>The proposed facility includes four primary components: (1) three closed-loop test frames, (2) two high temperature furnaces, (3) a digital control system, and (4) a hydraulic power supply. The facility was designed to test a variety of specimens ranging from small-scale material coupons to full-scale structural connections, a variety of loading histories ranging from static to impulsive, and a variety of thermal profiles from isothermal to temperature gradients and simulated fire histories. Basic material tests can be performed in the small load frame to evaluate the behavior and suitability of existing and new materials for use in buildings exposed to fires. New materials such as FRP and thermo-mechanically processed steel can be evaluated. The two larger load frames and large furnace provide the ability to test structural assemblages and connections. The proposed facility is unique within the US and provides unparalleled capabilities for high-temperature testing. The facility is not restricted to conducting standard code-based<br/>fire tests. The proposed facility will provide the basis for the development of rational design<br/>specifications and introduction of new building materials to reduce the hazards in a fire.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed facility extend far beyond the acquisition of equipment. The<br/>proposed facility will greatly enhance the educational capabilities within the Departments of Civil and Mechanical Engineering and will complement on-going efforts within the College of Engineering to develop a multidisciplinary research thrust in the area of fire-structure interaction. Research results will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate courses in Architectural, Civil, and Mechanical Engineering. Undergraduate students in the structural design courses will be introduced to large-scale testing and research opportunities through laboratory demonstrations that compare the behavior of structural components at room and elevated temperatures. Faculty members associated with the proposed facility currently serve on specification committees for steel, concrete, masonry, wood, and fire protection which provide an avenue for the dissemination of the research results to the engineering community and ultimately into the design specifications and model building codes used in throughout the US.<br/><br/>

This project is investigating algorithmic and implementation issues in monitoring and controlling multithreaded distributed computations. The techniques in this project are useful for testing distributed Java programs and for fault-tolerance during their execution. The project is investigating techniques in four areas: slicing, dependency tracking, global predicate detection and controlling a computation. Computation slicing is useful in reducing the size of the computation that needs to be analyzed. The project is developing online and distributed algorithms for slicing. Dependency tracking is required for online monitoring of global predicates and is currently done using vector clocks of dimension equal to the number of processes and threads in the system. The project is investigating a technique calledchain clocks that can track dependency in a scalable way even for a large-scale system. Global predicate detection is required to detect bugs during testing or runtime.  The project is investigating detection of temporal logic predicates interpreted over the lattice of global states of a computation. Controlling a computation is useful during the testing phase to steer the computation toward software bugs and during the operation phase to steer it away from any existing software bugs.<br/><br/>The project is implementing a framework in Java and it will result in theoretical and practical advances in monitoring and testing of concurrent programs. The project is expected to significantly improve the quality and fault-tolerance of distributed software.<br/>

The project is unifying, assessing, and disseminating these materials for direct and efficient implementation by educators. Active learning methodologies and procedures are based on the Kolbe Cycle of learning that includes (1) active experimentation, (2) concrete experience, (3) reflective observation and (4) abstract hypothesis and conceptualization. Assessment of student learning is based on their development of critical thinking skills. <br/><br/>The project is building upon prior, award-winning work that was developed collaboratively by the PI and CoPI at their home institutions, the University of Texas and the United States Air Force Academy. Faculty members from Austin Community College are determining how the material can be adapted and transferred to a community college environment.  <br/><br/>Broader impacts from the project include direct collaboration with the University of Missouri-Rolla, which is developing CD interactive curriculum for the same course. Materials from each project are being created so that they can be integrated into a coherent package. The approach is providing a model for developing teaching aids in Mechanics of Materials as well as other engineering subject matter. National dissemination of the materials is through commercial publishing, commercial web sites, and links to MSC finite element software. Workshops to train faculty to use these techniques are being developed and are being implemented as the project matures.  <br/><br/>

The objectives of the conference are to bring together linguists who work on any aspect of the linguistics of Latin American indigenous languages to exchange the most recent results of their research.  Roughly three groups of scholars form the core of this conference:  Latin American nationals who work on the indigenous languages of their countries and other countries in Latin America, linguists who are native speakers of indigenous languages, and other scholars who work on Latin American indigenous languages.<br/><br/>This conference provides a forum for researchers from many different countries and with similar interests to meet. It facilitates an examination of common factors that have resulted from similar sociolinguistic situations of Latin American languages and of areal features among language families that are distributed across more than one country or that have arisen through significant diffusion across language families.  The conference also contributes to the continuing education of speakers of indigenous languages who are engaged in linguistic research, and to the integration of linguists from different countries and different language backgrounds in common research efforts.<br/>

Most economic and social settings are characterized by repeated interaction between  agents. Learning models have long sought to model how agents learn in such repeated interactions. The learning process most commonly assumed is one that maps actions to payoffs and updates this mapping with each new set of evidence. While such behavioral learning is useful in a broad set of situations, humans also tend to display cognitive learning-- learning how to reason about a game and to anticipate other players' actions and other developments. One major difference between the behavioral and cognitive approaches is that in the former, learning between games is not possible unless the actions are labeled the same, whereas in the latter, learning between games is possible<br/>and can be characterized and understood with the appropriate framework. The rule learning framework of Stahl (1996) is ideal in this regard. The rule-learning framework<br/>posits individuals who apply rules and form mappings between rules and payoffs rather<br/>than actions and payoffs. Then reinforcement occurs over rules and individuals learn over<br/>time to abandon historically inferior rules in favor of historically successful rules.  The PI team has demonstrated that Rule Learning can accommodate such behavioral dynamics, and they will now conduct experiments to test those predictions. <br/><br/>Understanding consumption, investment or managerial rules and predicting which will rules will survive and which will perish is an important task for economists and one which is requires an understanding of how learning transfers between situations. The present framework is an important step in this direction.<br/><br/>

These advances create many new possibilities for studying structures of materials in chemistry, physics, materials science, engineering, biology and geosciences that can improve our understanding of our planet, new materials, failure of materials, and life itself. Experiments with such intense, compact sources and microcrystals, however, change powder diffraction to a single- or few-crystal studies that may yield much more detail about structures. The principal goals of this developmental project are to make structural analysis by X-ray diffraction with micrometer sources and samples as straightforward and productive as studies with larger samples and to develop software for instrument control and data analysis that will readily transfer to a wide range of these applications and many synchrotrons. The project builds upon work by Dera, Downs, Mao, Prewitt, and Somayazulu to enable single-crystal diffraction studies with samples of micron dimensions in diamond-anvil cells at megabar pressures, work by Denton to develop novel detectors for these applications, and the availability of new micro-focus diffraction beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source and Advanced Light Source. While studying materials at extremely high pressures is the particular focus for these developments, potential applications of the results for diffraction work extend broadly in the sciences and engineering. Among the novel experimental approaches to structural determination with micron samples we plan to develop are: using limited area detector data with a monochromatic source to determine rapidly unit cells and determining peak intensities with a point detector; using high precision rotation stages and fast area detectors to collect a full data set in one oscillation pattern and computing unit cell parameters with efficient algorithms; automating a combined Laue & EDX approach for determining unit cell dimensions and extending it towards structure solution applications; developing a foil-mask X-ray area detector spectrometer based on stacked CMOS detectors separated by energy-selective masks, and resolving energies of Laue peaks by step-scanning monochromatic radiation and using high-readout-speed detectors. <br/><br/><br/>Recent advances in the x-ray sources make possible X-ray studies with micrometer and nanometer beam spots and create new possibilities for understanding structures important to chemistry, physics, materials science, engineering, biology and geosciences. Detailed structural analyses can be done for fine grains within powders, rocks, and metal alloys. Engineering analyses of the strains in materials being deformed by stresses will be extended to much smaller sizes. Structures of natural or important technological materials will be determined under extreme conditions of pressure (more than a million atmospheres) and temperatures (from near absolute zero to more than 8000 degrees Celsius). These studies will help to improve our understanding of our planet, new materials, failure of materials, and life itself. The principal goal of the project is to make structural analysis with X-rays of small samples as simple as those done with automated commercial X-ray instruments. While studying materials at extremely high pressures is the particular focus for these developments, applications of the results for the techniques and software for instrument control and data analysis will readily transfer to a wide range of applications in science and technology. <br/>

The purpose is to determine the distribution and kinematics (deformational style) of late Paleozoic deformation across Nevada.  The conventional understanding of the evolution of western North America recognizes only two orogenic (mountain-building) events during Paleozoic time.  However, this team of investigators has found unequivocal evidence for previously-unrecognized Mississippian, Pennsylvanian and Permian contractional deformation events in the Pinon Range and Adobe Range, Nevada. Their work, along with published mapping by numerous other workers, indicates that these events may be widespread. This broad geographic extent and temporal persistence of contraction between the previously recognized orogenies raises some fundamental questions regarding the tectonic processes acting on western North America in Late Paleozoic time.  This project is extending the investigation north to the Idaho border, and south into eastern California. This study has the potential to revise current thinking about unifying tectonic models for the Paleozoic evolution of western North America.  It will, unequivocally, result in a better understanding of the extent, geometry, kinematics and timing of Late Paleozoic deformation in Nevada.  It may also result in a reinterpretation of when and why contractional deformation occurred in the western part of the continent.<br/><br/>The results of this study will be of use to the mining and energy industries, because of the importance of these rocks and structures to producing and trapping hydrocarbons and to hosting gold deposits in Nevada.  They may also relate to groundwater supplies for the ever-growing population of Nevada, because the structures may disrupt or displace aquifers.  Research results from these workers are already being used to build more accurate hydrologic models locally in southern Nevada.

The membrane materials in this work are rubbery, crosslinked copolymer networks specifically formulated to achieve high solubility selectivity for larger, polar or quadrupolar gas molecules over smaller, non-polar molecules while simultaneously minimizing size sieving. The networks are prepared via copolymerization of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-rich acrylate and diacrylate monomers. Preliminary permeation studies on non-optimized membranes have demonstrated that preferential transport of carbon dioxide over hydrogen can be accomplished with PEG-based networks, with the highest combination of carbon dioxide permeability and selectivity yet reported for non-facilitated transport membranes. These pilot studies also indicate that the gas separation performance is sensitive to the details of the network structure, with variations in crosslink density and backbone pendant groups leading to significant changes in both permeability and overall selectivity.  To fully realize the potential of this new class of membranes, a systematic experimental study is proposed based on the preparation and characterization of networks with controlled variations in structure and crosslink density. The membranes will be strategically designed to optimize their performance both in terms of separation properties and overall mechanical integrity. Keys to understanding the relationship between network structure and gas separation properties are the polymer chain dynamics and local free volume, as related to the diffusivity selectivity of the membranes. The project will lead to enhanced fundamental understanding as to the correlation of chain dynamics and morphology with gas separation performance for rubbery networks, and the emergence of molecular-based design paradigms for this industrially-relevant class of membrane materials. In addition to the fundamental materials and membrane science goals associated with the proposal, broader impacts include the potential application of these new membranes as replacements for industrial gas separation processes based on cumbersome, energy-intensive methods such as absorption.  This work will lead to important educational benefits through graduate student training.  Further, the planned industrial liaison with Air Liquide and interaction with CSIRO (Australia) will provide direct input regarding industrial goals and priorities for gas separation membranes, and expanded resources for the characterization of these materials.  This work could lead to a new class of membranes for industrially important gas separations.<br/>

Research by Dr. Matthew Lachniet and graduate students investigates past rainfall histories in Central America and other areas, using the stable oxygen isotope measurements preserved in cave stalagmites, which grow continuously over time and whose age is determined by radiometric dating. These past rainfall histories will help researchers understand past variations in the El Nino/Southern Oscillation, which produces global climatic anomalies, in order to predict future recurrence intervals of El Nino events in Central American and beyond. The research by Dr. Ganqing Jiang and graduate students has investigated the isotopic evidence for Snowball Earth events approximately 500 to 700 million years ago, when geologic evidence suggests the possibility that the majority of the Earth was glaciated. Acquisition of a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer at UNLV will permit in-house analysis of samples, ensuring high sample throughput. Importantly, the SIL will give undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to learn a state-of-the-art analytical technique at UNLV, which will promote the integration of research and education into their research programs.  <br/><br/><br/>
0517328	The Role of Multimodal Cue Assessment in Sexual Selection	IOS	BEHAVIORAL SYSTEMS CLUSTER, ANIMAL BEHAVIOR	09/01/2005	05/21/2007	Michael Ryan	TX	University of Texas at Austin	Continuing grant	daniel wiegmann	08/31/2009	$358,518.00	Ryan Taylor	mryan@utexas.edu	3925 West Braker Lane, Ste 11072	Austin	TX	787595316	5124716424	BIO	7472, 7659	1096, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	An active body of research has demonstrated that females are likely to influence the evolution of male traits by preferring to mate with the most conspicuous males in a population.  For example, female peafowl prefer to mate with peacocks possessing tails that are highly ornamented with eyespots and female frogs prefer to mate with males that produce longer or more complex vocal calls.  The vast majority of this research, however, has focused on how females choose mates when presented with only a single kind of mating signal.  For example, extensive experimental work has shown that female frogs express preferences for certain properties of male vocal (advertisement) calls.  Under natural conditions, however, animals are likely to use several different sensory modalities (auditory, visual, olfactory etc.) to gather information about potential mates.  Thus, experiments that consider only one kind of information may fail to demonstrate the outcome of female mate choice as it occurs under natural conditions.  The experiments in this proposal are designed to determine how female tungara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, choose mates when they are presented with multiple kinds of information.  The researchers will present female tungara frogs with a combination of auditory signals (male vocal calls) and visual cues (highly realistic robotic male frogs that mimic the movement of live males) to assess the outcome of mate choice.  In doing so, the researchers will be able to gain a better understanding of the processes by which females choose mates and how those mate choices are likely to influence the evolution of both male calls and vocal sac pattern.  In addition, this research seeks to understand how the female tungara frog brain processes multiple kinds of sensory information.  The researchers will investigate neural activity within the frogs' brain to gain a better understanding of how multiple sensory inputs are processed.  These data will yield insights into neural processes by which females integrate multiple information types into their mate choice decisions.  Finally, this research will compare behavioral and neural responses of female frogs between two species, the tungara frog and the (Peter's Frog), Physalaemus petersi.  Although these two species are closely related, their behavior and ecology are very different.  Broader impacts ensue from comparisons of female responses to multiple stimuli across species thus, the researchers will be able to better understand the factors influencing the evolution of multicomponent sexual displays. Additionally the research program of the PI has had broader impacts in four areas: 1) student training; 2) especially of Latin Americans and women; 3) educational outreach, development of free research tools; and 4) a variety of miscellaneous results that heighten public awareness of animal behavior. Contributions in all of these areas of broader impact will be continued in this research program.

Recent events have demonstrated the vulnerability of many structures to both natural phenomena and terrorist acts.  The failure of buildings in earthquakes or by bombing has shown the profession the importance of confinement, continuity, and capacity. The high strength to weight ratio of carbon fiber materials make them ideal candidates for modifying the performance of reinforced concrete members or structures with inadequate shear, flexure, or tension capacity, poor confinement, or poor detailing of reinforcement.    The purpose of this proposal is to demonstrate the efficacy of using CFRP materials to develop alternate load paths to (1) carry forces in the event that critical elements of a structure are severely damaged or removed, or (2) augment the capacity of a structure by providing independent additional load paths.  The development of techniques based on the use of CFRP materials for modifying the performance of existing structures under extreme loadings will provide structural engineers with an option for .hardening. those structures that has heretofore not been available. <br/> <br/>Intellectual Merit   <br/>The project will create knowledge in an area that is new to the profession and essential to understanding the performance of structures vulnerable to progressive collapse. There is very little experimental evidence available to guide the research and design community in evaluating and rehabilitating systems where such vulnerabilities exist.  The manner in which a structure survives the damage that occurs as a result of terrorist attacks or other extreme loading events has not been extensively studied.  Although there is considerable information regarding seismic assessment and rehabilitation of structures,  The damage produced by terrorist attacks or other extreme loading is quite different and is likely to affect only a relatively small portion of the structure but may imperil the entire system if progressive collapse occurs.  <br/> <br/>Broader Impacts   <br/>o By involving practicing engineers in the project, the data will be transferred to practice rapidly. The emphasis will be to transfer information to groups working on homeland security issues and groups developing progressive collapse evaluation and mitigation guidelines and policy.FEMA, NIST, GSA, Structural Engineering Associations in various states. <br/>o In selecting graduate and undergraduate students for the research team, special efforts will be made to secure students from underrepresented groups and from area high-schools.  The graduate and undergraduate student bodies in Civil Engineering at the University of Texas have large fractions of women and Hispanic students available to participate in the project. <br/>o The findings from the research will be utilized in a graduate course on evaluation and rehabilitation of existing reinforced concrete structures under extreme loadings.  It will include consideration of structures for vulnerable to progressive collapse.   <br/>

Carmona and K. Ronnie Sircar, Princeton University<br/>Jean-Pierre Fouque, North Carolina State University<br/>Thaleia Zariphopoulou, University of Texas at Austin<br/><br/>FRG: Collaborative Research on Mathematical Methods for Defaultable Instruments  <br/><br/>This project investigates problems in financial mathematics motivated by credit markets in which a major source of risk is the potential default of debtors on their payment obligations.  Specifically, the problems under consideration are i) utility-indifference valuation of default risk; ii) design of instruments to optimally enhance credit worthiness; iii) asymptotic analysis of stochastic intensity models to study the time-scale content of corporate yield spreads; iv) computational issues related to the analysis of correlation between defaults across firms, modeled as large systems in interaction.  The first part involves stochastic control problems related to random intensity models and infinite dimensional interest rate models. The second also overlaps and involves filtering of partially observed systems.  The third uses singular and regular perturbation techniques for the class of interacting potential partial differential equations arising in this context, and the fourth uses interacting particle systems to compute probabilities which are sensitive to correlation of defaults, as well as Monte Carlo computations designed for the analysis of rare events.  The intellectual merit of this project is in developing applicable scientific tools to address the particular class of optimization, design, calibration and computation issues which are essential for managing default risk.<br/><br/>Defaultable instruments, or credit-linked derivatives, are financial securities that pay their holders amounts that are contingent on the occurrence (or not) of a default event such as the bankruptcy of a firm (or a country or municipality), non-repayment of a loan or missing a mortgage payment.  The market in credit-linked derivative products has grown more than seven-fold in recent years, from $170 billion outstanding notional in 1997, to almost $1400 billion through 2001.  These instruments raise new challenges in modeling, analysis, computation and estimation, some of which we propose to study here by bringing together a Focused Research Group with expertise in applied mathematics, stochastic processes and computational statistics.  The broader impact of the project is in deeper understanding of credit risks, which affect people from large commercial institutions to individuals with pension funds and mortgages, and designing and correctly valuing instruments to control for it.  The project is also strongly geared towards training of five graduate students and one postdoctoral associate, who will benefit enormously from interaction with all parts of the broad-based group through many meetings, and in particular a large international conference on the research area at the end of the three years.  The experience gained by the PI's will be reflected in their teaching of specialist graduate and undergraduate classes, and advising Senior Thesis projects in this field.  As well as the closing conference, the results of the work will be disseminated through academic and industry meetings, classes and articles written for peer-reviewed journals.<br/><br/>

Cosmology has become a data-rich field, especially with current and forthcoming CMB sky maps, which form a snapshot of the Universe at an age of a few hundred thousand years.  Such maps have improved dramatically over the years and are now largely responsible for our detailed understanding of the contents and history of the Universe.  CMB polarization maps may even be able to provide direct evidence for an inflationary epoch during the Universe's earliest moments.  This research will develop methods for analyzing CMB polarization maps, especially the separation of components, and for characterizing common contaminants (such as Galactic dust) and their statistical properties.  Theoretical work will also include how much extra cosmological information can be obtained from observations of the CMB quadrupole in remote galaxy clusters.<br/><br/>This work will be carried out in collaboration with talented undergraduates, many from under-represented groups, who will be introduced to the excitement of research in astrophysics.

Stark	08/31/2008	$108,000.00		danknopf@math.utexas.edu	3925 West Braker Lane, Ste 11072	Austin	TX	787595316	5124716424	MPS	1265	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Abstract<br/><br/>Award:  DMS-0505920<br/>Principal Investigator:  Dan F. Knopf<br/><br/>The project will advance the search for canonical geometries by<br/>means of geometric heat flows. In light of the landmark progress<br/>made recently by Perelman in Hamilton's program to resolve the<br/>Geometrization and Poincare' Conjectures, this research area is<br/>undergoing a rapid and productive expansion. The powerful<br/>innovations and profound insights in Perelman's work contribute<br/>to the extraordinary power of Ricci flow as a tool for<br/>investigating the geometry and topology of Riemannian and complex<br/>manifolds. In virtually all known applications of Ricci flow, it<br/>is critical to have a deep understanding of the mechanisms of<br/>singularity formation. Therefore, the project will investigate<br/>four aspects of singularity formation. These four objectives are<br/>chosen to build upon the prior results and current research<br/>program of the PI and to be highly relevant to promising new<br/>applications of Ricci flow. The objectives are to study (1)<br/>asymptotics of Ricci flow singularity formation, (2) analysis of<br/>Ricci flow singularities in dimension four, (3) analysis of<br/>singularity models for Kaehler-Ricci flow, and (4) the structure<br/>of reduced geometry.<br/><br/>A manifold is an object that - like our universe - looks like<br/>Euclidean space locally, but whose global topology and geometry<br/>may be much different. The broad goals of this project are to<br/>find optimal geometric structures with which to categorize<br/>manifolds. The methods used are certain partial differential<br/>equations called geometric heat flows. The idea is to let a<br/>geometric object evolve in time in such a way that its geometry<br/>improves and simplifies, possibly after a change in topology. A<br/>geometric heat flow called the Ricci flow has just yielded major<br/>breakthroughs in two of the most difficult open problems in<br/>mathematics. These successes provide great incentives to apply it<br/>to other challenging open problems and make it a very active and<br/>competitive field of research. The types of partial differential<br/>equations studied in Ricci flow have much in common with those<br/>used to model the movement of oil in shale and in thin films,<br/>combustion in porous media, heat propagation, avalanches,<br/>population dispersal, the spreading of microscopic droplets, and<br/>certain effects in plasma physics. For this reason, methods<br/>developed in this project may have important applications to<br/>those areas of applied mathematics. The project will focus on the<br/>delicate analysis needed to understand such equations as they<br/>become singular. This analysis should have important broad<br/>applications, among which are the following. (i) The methods<br/>developed, especially asymptotic analysis, should extend to the<br/>practical applications mentioned above. (ii) The project will<br/>promote interdisciplinary interactions with physics, where there<br/>are many applications for geometric classification and flow<br/>techniques. For example, theorists in general relativity want to<br/>classify possible topologies of four-dimensional<br/>space-times. Researchers in string theory and mirror symmetry are<br/>interested in understanding certain six-dimensional<br/>manifolds. The Ricci flow itself is an approximation to the<br/>renormalization flow for an important model in quantum field<br/>theory.  (iii) The project will benefit graduate education,<br/>because the PI will invest time helping students develop<br/>expertise in relevant areas of geometry, analysis, and topology.<br/>

Unfortunately, mobile networks are not equipped to provide the high-speed access that Internet users expect due to fundamental problems associated with wireless communication: scarce bandwidth and poor quality. To overcome these problems, this research develops a family of algorithms that allow the transmitter to respond to changes in the propagation channel. The major innovation in this work is the development of new methods for compressing information about the propagation channel. This information is sent from the receiver back to the transmitter to help the transmitter adjust the transmitted signal. <br/><br/>The approach to this research is to develop a framework for source coding with a new source: the wireless channel. This differs from traditional source coding in that the objective is to improve communication theoretic system performance as opposed to improving the fidelity of the reconstruction. The objectives of the research are to determine what channel state information should be quantized; develop algorithms for quantizing the essential parameters of the channel; derive suitable communication theoretic notions of fidelity of the quantization such as mutual information and bit error rate; characterize the tradeoff between feedback rate and network performance; and confront practical issues introduced by estimation error, errors and delay in the feedback channel, and implementation constraints.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the work are expected in diverse areas including research in the form of new algorithms, theoretical results, and insights; industry through mobile network applications developed by industry partners; and education through better trained engineers, research experiences for minority students, mentoring, and enhanced learning worldwide thanks to publicly available courseware.<br/><br/><br/>

When the observer is replaced by a light source, and<br/>the obstruction to sight (the occluders) constitute non-reflecting obstacles, the problem translates to that<br/>of finding the illuminated regions. The PI proposes to study computational and mathematical aspects of<br/>problems involving visibility optimization. Novel optimal control and game formulations with visibility<br/>objectives will be introduced and investigated. Shock-capturing techniques as well as numerical algorithms<br/>for Hamilton-Jacobi equations will be introduced and a new type of Hamilton-Jacobi equation with<br/>discontinuous coefficients will be rigorously derived, and whose viscosity solution theory will<br/>correspondingly be developed. Variational calculus and higher order PDEs will be investigated and incoporated.<br/><br/>This proposal concerns developing practical mathematical and computational strategies for optimizing surveillance in many different contexts. The potential impacts for the proposed project include surveillance and robotic path planning, which are of immediate national interest, and applications that involve computations of high frequency wave propagation such as radar cross section computations in stealth fighter jet design. As an example of a potential application, consider a robot placed on a terrain such as the surface of Mars. The mission is the explore the terrain using various devices, including a video recording device. How does one compute the visibility of this robot? How should an optimal search path be designed? If more than one robot is placed in the domain, how should the robots coordinate for a jointly optimal search result? In the context of wireless communication, a similar question can be raised as to finding an optimal placement of n wireless base stations for maximal averaged coverage in an urban region, or determining a path with maximal averaged signal coverage given the locations of base stations. In designing UAV's (Unmanned Aviation Vehicles), how should one track a target to keep it in sight for as long time as possible? In general pursuit-evasion problems: What is the best way to make a certain hidden object become visible? Or the reverse: What is the best way to hide from a moving threat? The computational approaches in the proposed project  will be guided by the practicality considerations guided by the listed examples as well as by certain level of rigorous mathematical theory.<br/>

One of the most widely recognized patterns in isotopic ecology is that animals are enriched in the stable isotope of nitrogen (15N) relative to their diets. This pattern is commonly used to assess an animal's trophic level. However, the mechanisms controlling variation in the enrichment of 15N are largely unknown. Laboratory experiments using an herbivorous insect, Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm), are being conducted to test the hypothesis that stoichiometric factors that influence its growth rate (C:N:P ratio of animal and food) also influence the difference in 15N content between its tissues and the food that it ingests. <br/><br/>The Fellow is gaining new experience as an ecologist by investigating organism-level questions using an interdisciplinary approach.<br/>

Current attempts at characterizing this inflow turbulence in design<br/>guidelines are overly conservative and have not been developed following field studies of turbine<br/>performance and simultaneous recording of associated wind conditions (because such tests are expensive).<br/>Also, today's guidelines recommend design loads based on inflow coherence spectral models that have<br/>been shown to be inconsistent with measurements, especially for spatial separations on the order of rotor<br/>diameters and smaller. Moreover, the design guidelines do not employ turbine aerodynamic and structural<br/>dynamic response simulations of sufficiently long durations to match the desired return periods (on the<br/>order of 20 years) typical for ultimate and fatigue limit states. Clearly, there is a need for more field test<br/>programs and efficient modeling procedures to accurately describe the inflow and turbine response so as to<br/>arrive at more accurate design loads.<br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The proposed career development plan addresses each of the issues raised. First, it offers a novel untried<br/>approach to characterizing the inflow turbulence random field by extracting spatially preferred modes<br/>that describe the inflow using empirical orthogonal decomposition of wind velocity statistics and spectra<br/>derived directly from newly available field measurements. Second, it offers an efficient procedure to make<br/>more realistic the possibility of carrying out long-duration aerodynamic simulations for turbine response<br/>while utilizing the decomposition of the inflow structure. Finally, it proposes a framework, based on<br/>structural reliability and response surface concepts, for deriving design loads by combining inflow<br/>characterization with turbine response statistics conditional on inflow.<br/>The proposed plan blends the use of extensive field data with simulation studies in addressing an<br/>important problem that could lead to more economical wind turbine designs and sustain the continued<br/>harvesting of wind as a renewable energy source.<br/>To summarize, at the heart of the proposed research plan are, in order, the following tasks:<br/>(i) development of efficient modeling techniques for characterizing the random spatial structure of<br/>wind inflow using field data - this will yield principal orthogonal preferred spatial modes that<br/>optimally describe the wind field;<br/>(ii) characterizing turbine response for the preferred spatial turbulence modes identified in (i) using<br/>turbine aerodynamic simulations; and<br/>(iii) establishing a probabilistic (structural reliability-based) framework that integrates (i) and (ii) to<br/>permit derivation of design ultimate and fatigue loads using simulations long enough to<br/>realistically reflect return periods on the order of 20 years.<br/>Research, education, and outreach activities that relate to this plan are outlined in this proposal.<br/>Broader Impacts<br/>An important point that needs to be made is that despite the tremendous growth in wind energy in the U.S.,<br/>our nation is seriously short of trained engineers in this field and routinely has to seek technical/consulting<br/>assistance from Western Europe. This needs to change, and this career development plan will present some<br/>ideas the PI has to provide such training opportunities to our undergraduate and graduate students including<br/>internship opportunities that will be facilitated by this plan, K-12 involvement, and curriculum<br/>enhancements that the PI has planned. This research study will, it is expected, offer a learning experience<br/>as well for individuals of various backgrounds: graduate and undergraduate research assistants, middle/high<br/>students and teachers, and university students in the PI's undergraduate engineering statistics course and in<br/>a planned graduate wind engineering course. Details related to these activities are outlined in this proposal.<br/>Two significant entities that have expressed their support for the success of this plan include<br/>(a) Sandia National Laboratories, who will provide the field data for the efforts outlined and will also<br/>provide summer research internship positions to five undergraduate minority students; and<br/>(b) the PI's institution's Equal Opportunity in Engineering (EOE) program, who will facilitate the<br/>involvement of an underrepresented/minority student in this research.<br/>Letters of commitment from both these organizations are included in the Supplementary Documents<br/>section of this proposal outlining their support.<br/>

Both study areas contain a variety of igneous rocks emplaced 850-700 million years ago, which is a critical time frame in Earth history. During this interval, the ancient supercontinent of Rodinia was beginning to break apart, setting the stage for subsequent rearrangement of continental land masses to form the younger Gondwana supercontinent. The team is carrying out paleomagnetic studies on an extensive suite of samples from selected rock units in the Kalahari and Congo cratons in order to constrain the original relative positions of the two cratons during breakup of Rodinia and prior to assembly of Gondwana. This work is coupled with a detailed program of isotopic dating, designed to produce rigorous constraints on the age of magnetization in the rocks and to determine whether the primary magnetization has been disturbed by subsequent thermal events. The Congo and Kalahari cratons formed the keystone of central Gondwana, which was assembled about 550 million years ago as different parts of the present-day southern continents collided. Acquisition of well-dated poles from both cratons will allow testing of competing models for Gondwana assembly: were the Congo and Kalahari cratons separated by a wide ocean basin before formation of Gondwana or were the two cratons already in roughly their present-day relative positions. The latter scenario would imply that the central part of Gondwana was inherited from the earlier Rodinia supercontinent, about which little is known. The project is collaborative in nature and involves workers at Texas Christian University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Texas at Austin in the US, and at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, the Geological Survey of Namibia, and the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. Students from both the US and Africa are involved in the field and laboratory work.

Emphasis will be placed on compounds that are likely to i) demonstrate unusual cation coordinating properties, ii) show liquid crystalline behavior, or iii) display interesting theoretical, spectroscopic, or optical properties. The proposed work is expected to provide further insights into the basic ground rules that govern the chemistry of polypyrrole macrocycles, namely how are intrinsic structural properties, such as macrocycle size, shape, and aromaticity (or lack thereof), translated into observable chemical features, including substrate recognition selectivity, metal complex stability, and liquid crystallinity. New synthetic methods, including those based on oxidative coupling, sulfur bridging, and nitrogen linking, will be developed to complement known methodologies, such as Heck couplings and olefin metathesis, that have yet to receive much attention in the expanded porphyrin or oligopyrrole macrocycle areas.<br/><br/>With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Jonathon L. Sessler, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin. Professor Sessler is exploring methods for the synthesis of novel organic compounds related to the so-called porphyrin unit that forms the basis of the oxygen transport and storage proteins, hemoglobin and myoglobin. The resulting systems are expected to give rise to new catalysts, sensors, and light modulating devices. Work in the synthetic porphyrin analogue area is highly interdisciplinary, involving aspects of organic synthesis, inorganic coordination chemistry, spectroscopy, optics, materials science, catalysis, and theoretical analysis. It thus provides an excellent training for young researchers who are then able to work effectively in a variety of research settings, including academe, industry, and government. Work in this area also contributes directly to the development of our technological infrastructure.

Will speakers choose to use a state-instituted official mother tongue over their native language? How will the language they choose to speak affect their ethnic identity construction? This dissertation research project will examine intergenerational language use among Chinese Singaporeans whose linguistic experiences differ from one another because of rapid language shift in postcolonial Singapore. In addition to examining the effects of language shift on how speakers interpret the languages and varieties spoken in their community, it also seeks to investigate the relationship between language and ethnic identity construction. Through participant observation of linguistic behaviors, audio and video recording of naturally occurring speech, and interviews with members in three multigenerational Chinese Singaporean households, this study utilizes the concepts of iconicity, fractal recursivity, and erasure (Irvine & Gal 2000) to provide a complex and layered framework for identifying and analyzing the semiotic processes of language ideologies that have resulted from State language policies. Bourdieu's (1991) notions of cultural and symbolic capital in linguistic markets [the linguistic market??] add an important politico-economic dimension to the investigation.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this study are found in the way that it  questions the link between language and ethnic identity that government policies assume. This project foregrounds the experiences of speakers, bringing attention to normalization processes of linguistic practices in Singaporean society, thereby permitting policymakers to better assess the consequences of the essentializing [essentializing?? Is this a word of English? Standard sociolinguistic jargon?] assignment of languages to ethnic groups. <br/>

Currently, the majority of these<br/>models are given in terms of large and complex sets of nonlinear differential equations, describing in painful<br/>detail the underlying biological phenomena. Although an invaluable asset for integrating genomics and<br/>proteomics data to reveal local interactions, such models are often not amenable to formal analysis and<br/>render simulation at the organ or even the cell level impractical.<br/>This proposal seeks to develop a hybrid-automata (HA) approach to modeling and analyzing complex biological systems. Excitable cell networks (heart cells in particular) will be used as an archetype of a complex biological system. Standard modeling methods capture the behavior of such cells using reaction-diffusion PDE systems, with the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) formalism describing ion channel gating and currents. Initial results indicate that HA models, combining discrete and continuous processes, are able to successfully capture the morphology of the excitation event (action potential) of different cell types, including cardiac cells. They can also reproduce typical excitable cell characteristics, such as refractoriness (period of non-responsiveness to external stimulation) and restitution (adaptation to pacing rates). Multicellular ensembles of HA elements are used to simulate excitation wave propagation, including complex spiral waves underlying pathological conditions in the heart. The resulting simulation framework exhibits significantly improved computational efficiency, and opens the possibility to formal analysis based on HA theory.<br/>

To enable routine computational study of organic and enzymatic reactions in solution, improved SQM methods are being developed. Inclusion of previously neglected Pauli repulsions and the addition of d-orbitals are expected to yield much enhanced results, especially for the description of conformational energy changes and barriers, hydrogen bonding, small ring compounds, and activation energies for reactions. The new SQM methods are being applied in QM/MM calculations to numerous organic reactions in solution, which exhibit significant solvent effects on their rates. This includes nucleophilic substitution, acylation, and Menshutkin reactions, decarboxylations, and [2,3] sigmatropic rearrangements. For general studies of reactions, it is also necessary to incorporate configuration interaction (CI) into the QM framework. This is being pursued using the Pair Excited CI method with initial applications to solvolysis reactions and Bergman cyclization. In all cases, the SQM and CI calculations are performed on-the-fly in MC simulations for the reactions in solution. The recently developed CRA (concerted rotation with variable bond angles) method will be used in MC simulations to perform ab initio folding of polypeptides. Optimization of the simulation protocols and application to small proteins are priority items in this case. Related studies are aimed at the prediction and optimization of the structures of peptides that catalyze asymmetric reactions, e.g., reactions for which the rate is different for mirror-image substrates. The work is expected to have a broad impact on the conceptual understanding of organic reaction mechanisms.

This process, called premelting, has significant consequences in the redistributing of brine in sea ice, the apparent migrating of contaminants through glacier ice, and the rate of frost heave and weathering in soils and rocks.<br/> Premelting is common to virtually all types of materials, but has been most extensively studied in ice.  It can be caused by adsorption forces, wetting, size effects, or substrate disorder, and involves many aspects of surface physics and phase transition phenomena.  The macroscale consequences of these molecular-scale processes include the relationship between seasonal freezing and the oceanic thermohaline circulation, and the quantitative interpretations of paleoclimate proxy records. On the longer climatic time scales, the overall features of recent glacial-interglacial cycles have been revealed in the Antarctic ice cores, but higher resolution is required to decipher the mechanisms that drive abrupt climate changes. The accuracy of any higher resolution paleoclimatic information derived from ice cores will have to rely on the proper treatment of processes that affect the trace constituents during their long (100 kyr) residence times in the ice sheets.  Grain-boundary melting is believed to be the primary process controlling the rate of material transport through the premelted-liquid networks of veins and nodes that line the grain intersections of glacier ice. Moreover, the role of grain-boundary melting can further increase the liquid content and enhance trace-constituent mobility.<br/>The project has three distinct, but interrelated components.  Direct measurements of premelting of grain boundaries in the presence of different impurities will be made as a function of temperature and grain mismatch, and experiments on instabilities that are predicted to occur at the growing sea ice/ocean interface in the presence of a shear flow will be conducted.  Both will be complemented by theoretical calculations to prove experimental issues and to pursue the implications of premelting in numerous contexts.<br/>

0519081	A New-Class of Molecularly-Engineered Nanoporous Dielectric Materials for Insulation in Device Wiring for Integrated Circuits	DMR	ELECTRONIC/PHOTONIC MATERIALS	09/01/2005	07/02/2008	Ganpati Ramanath	NY	Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute	Continuing grant	Z.

Rapid Cu diffusion into adjacent insulating dielectric material and poor Cu-dielectric interfacial adhesion are major issues in device wiring in electronic circuits. Typically, 10-20 nm-thick transition-metal based interfacial barrier layers are used to circumvent the problem. Such thick barrier layers cannot be used in sub-50-nm devices because they decrease the space meant for low-resistivity Cu and neutralize the main advantage of Cu wiring. Ultrathin (e.g., <3 nm) barriers required of these materials are not easy to deposit by conventional methods, especially to conformally coat high depth-to-width aspect ratio features common in multilevel wiring. Intellectual merit: Self- assembled molecular nanolayers (SAMs) offer potential to overcome shortcomings of conventional barriers while enhancing the chemical and mechanical integrity of the Cu-dielectric interface. This project seeks to integrate low-polarizability organosilane SAMs into porous dielectrics during synthesis and develop an understanding of the electrical and mechanical properties, and chemical and thermal stability, to enable the direct integration of this material with Cu. The approach involves incorporating (a) chemical-attack-inhibiting moieties on external and internal surfaces and (b) molecular bridges and ordered pores to mechanically reinforce porous dielectrics. Specific objectives are to: (i) Synthesize barrier-less dielectrics through the incorporation of pore-passivating and adhesion-enhancing molecular moieties into silica-based porous dielectrics; (ii) Mechanically reinforce the porous dielectric by creating ordered pores, and molecular bridging of pore walls by cross-linking low-polarizability organosilanes; (iii) Characterize the effects of the above strategies on dielectric properties, thermal and chemical stability, resilience to Cu-diffusion, and Cu-dielectric interfacial adhesion; and (iv) Understand and optimize the effects of molecular termini, chain length, and fraction of intra-pore molecular crosslinking, and processing parameters on properties. To achieve the above, organosilanes with Cu immobilizing, hydrophobic, or cross-linkable termini will be introduced into micellar templates used in sol-gel synthesis of porous silica, and integrated with the dielectric during gelation and post-treatments. Processing-structure-chemistry-property relationships will be revealed through a combination of electrical tests during thermal annealing in controlled ambients, four-point-bend adhesion tests, nanoindentation, atomic force microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.<br/>Broader impact: The success of this approach could revolutionize wiring design and fabrication for integrated circuits with sub-50-nm devices by obviating interfacial barrier layers between metals and dielectrics. The new knowledge gained from this study will provide atomistic insights on key properties of molecularly engineered porous dielectrics, aid in combining nanostructure self-assembly with device fabrication, and contribute towards bridging micro- and nano-device technologies.  The project will also provide a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary training of  graduate and undergraduate students through research in molecular self-assembly, sol-gel processing, materials characterization, and device fabrication and testing. Collaborative interactions with IBM will enrich the students' learning experience. A summer internship for two high-school teachers is planned to create and share demonstrations for use in their classrooms. This new activity will complement ongoing visits and reverse-visits to high-schools in the capital region and Rensselaer, contribute to increasing students' awareness on self-assembly and nanodevices and their connection with applied physics and chemistry, and kindle students' interest in science and engineering. The research will be integrated in the self-assembly and molecular nanostructures of a Nanostructured Materials course taught by the PI through an interactive web-module. <br/>

LU, RPI<br/><br/>Objective: The objective of this research is the growth and measurement of the mechanical responses of three-dimensional nanostructures under external driving forces (mechanical, electrical, magnetic or thermal). The approach is to use an oblique angle deposition technique to fabricate nanostructures in the forms of rods, beams, and helical springs. This deposition technique is a physical self-assembly method based on the shadowing effect during thermal evaporation or sputter deposition of atomic species onto a flat or templated substrate. The fundamental electromechanical, magnetomechanical, magnetoresistive, damping, and thermal transport properties of these nanostructures will be characterized using nanoscale probes that measure force, current, magnetic field, and heat transport. Fundamental knowledge in the mechanical properties of these nanostructures and any deviation from their bulk scaling laws will be gained. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The research will open up many new opportunities in the US economy in NEMS (nanoelectromechanical systems) applications such as actuators, resonators, and dampers. It will also provide unprecedented opportunities for fundamental studies and practical applications. Areas included are nanophotonic devices for optical communication, energy devices for efficient light emitters, highly efficient heat transfer and thermoelectric extractors, extremely sensitive chemical and biological sensors, nanofluidic reactors, magnetic sensor arrays, super-high-density 3D magnetic recording, and nano-catalysis. These represent a multi-billion-dollar high technology industry that will save energy and improve the quality of lives. Graduate students and postdocs will be trained through the integrative research, education, and outreach activities and be ready for the high tech work force. <br/>

Recent high-resolution seismic tomography shows rich <br/>variety of interaction of convection current with the mantle <br/>transition zone. One of the key data that are needed to understand <br/>the nature of this interaction is the rheological properties of <br/>materials in this layer. However, experimental studies of plastic <br/>deformation are difficult and there has been no quantitative <br/>rheological data on materials in this region. In this project, the <br/>investigators will conduct the first well-controlled quantitative <br/>rheological measurements on wadsleyite, the most abundant mineral in <br/>the shallow transition zone. A newly developed apparatus, RDA <br/>(rotational Drickamer apparatus), will be used in this study. <br/>Deformation experiments will be conducted to large strains to obtain <br/>not only the rheological data but also the relationship between <br/>deformation geometry and seismic anisotropy.  The results from this <br/>research will help understand the mechanical coupling between the <br/>upper mantle and the transition zone (that affects the geoid <br/>anomalies associated with mantle convection) as well as the <br/>deformability of slabs in the transition zone and the distribution <br/>and the mechanisms of deep earthquakes. The results on the relation <br/>between the lattice-preferred orientation of wadsleyite and flow <br/>geometry will be the first data set to interpret seismic anisotropy <br/>in terms of flow geometry in this region.<br/>

First, a stochastic model will be<br/>developed to represent how water molecules interact with the surface<br/>of a protein.  Water plays a crucial role in the functioning of<br/>proteins, and must be accounted for in molecular dynamics simulations<br/>which attempt to predict the dynamics of a protein molecule.  The<br/>detailed inclusion of water molecules in such simulations is however<br/>very costly and limits the practical scope of these simulations.  The<br/>stochastic model for the water-protein interaction to be<br/>developed in the research is intended to<br/>provide a more efficient representation of the effects of water and<br/>thereby accelerate protein dynamics calculations.  It will consist of<br/>a lattice model parameterization of the chemistry and geometry of the<br/>protein surface and a generalized diffusion process for the water<br/>molecules moving in a potential induced by the surface lattice model.<br/>A second component of the proposed research is an extension of the<br/>analytical and computational methodology for modeling molecular motors<br/>to include more physical realism.  Asymptotic and stochastic<br/>techniques will be employed to characterize molecular motors operating<br/>in multiple dimensions and/or with multiple degrees of freedom, and to<br/>incorporate random modulations in the force potentials.  The Immersed<br/>Boundary computational method, recently extended to include thermal<br/>fluctuations, will be used to simulate molecular motor processes in a<br/>way which incorporates in a natural way osmotic effects and the<br/>dynamics of the fluid medium.<br/><br/>More broadly, this CAREER project comprises a research program and<br/>course developments at the undergraduate and graduate levels which<br/>will apply the principal investigator's prior experience in turbulence<br/>modeling to new problems in microbiology, and provide more systematic<br/>opportunities to communicate knowledge and problem-solving<br/>approaches to undergraduate and graduate students.  The research<br/>objective pertaining to the interaction between protein and water<br/>molecules has the potential for providing a significant speedup in<br/>simulations of protein dynamics by reducing the cost of modeling the<br/>effects of the water.  Accelerated protein dynamic simulations would<br/>expedite both our basic understanding of protein dynamics and the<br/>technological development of drugs and devices designed to interact<br/>with proteins.  Analytical and computational research on molecular<br/>motors will aim to improve the physical understanding of how<br/>biological cells move and transport material within themselves.  The<br/>broader impacts of the project include the interdisciplinary training<br/>of graduate students in mathematical and computational modeling in<br/>microbiology, the introduction of new graduate courses on stochastic<br/>modeling, the renovation of an undergraduate course on probability<br/>theory  to incorporate modern research<br/>efforts and issues as contexts for the learning of mathematical<br/>techniques, material to be posted on the World Wide Web to disseminate<br/>these pedagogical applications, and broader opportunities for<br/>undergraduate students to gain experience in mathematical modeling.
0457444	Representation Theory of Infinite Dimensional Lie Aglebras and Quantum Field Theory	DMS	ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM, MSPA-INTERDISCIPLINARY	07/15/2005	04/20/2009	Igor Frenkel	CT	Yale University	Continuing grant	Tomek Bartoszynski	06/30/2011	$428,745.00		frenkel@math.yale.edu	Office of Sponsored Projects	New Haven	CT	065208327	2037854689	MPS	1264, 7454	0000, 7303, OTHR	$0.00	REPRESENTATION THEORY OF INFINITE DIMENSIONAL LIE<br/>ALGEBRAS AND QUANTUM FIELD THEORY<br/>IGOR FRENKEL<br/>Abstract<br/>The proposal is dedicated to the development of three interrelated areas in the<br/>representation theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their applications to<br/>quantum field theory (QFT). The first part of the proposal is focused on the vertex<br/>operator algebra structure of a modification of regular representations of affine Lie<br/>algebras. The author plans to prove, in particular, his conjecture that the zeroth<br/>semi-infinite cohomology of the reduced vertex operator algebra yields the famous<br/>Verlinde algebra of the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model of 2 dimensional QFT.<br/>The second part of the proposal consists of a cohomological and K-theoretic realization<br/>of various algebraic constructions of the first part by means of 4 dimensional<br/>classical Yang-Mills theory. The author proposes to use the geometric construction<br/>due to Nakajima of representations of affine Lie algebras based on Yang-Mills<br/>instantons on asymptotically locally Euclidean spaces, and also a new geometric<br/>construction related to the first one by the level-rank duality discovered by the<br/>author in the algebraic context in his earlier work. Finally, the third part is dedicated<br/>to a new direction in the representation theory of 3 dimensional convolution<br/>and current algebras presently developed by the author. It is based on a new noncommutative<br/>geometry of quantum Minkowski space-time recently introduced by<br/>Jardim and the author in their study of a noncommutative version of the Yang-<br/>Mills theory. The three parts of the proposal are related to each other in that they<br/>constitute a new program: a representation theoretic approach to 4 dimensional<br/>QFT. This is a far reaching extension of the representation theoretic approach to<br/>2 dimensional QFT previously developed by the author and other mathematicians<br/>and mathematical physicists.<br/>The proposal is devoted to problems at the frontiers of modern representation<br/>theory: the field of mathematics that studies symmetries and their realizations.<br/>By its nature representation theory underlies and unifies the structures of diverse<br/>areas in mathematics and physics, and in the past 25 years the author has made a<br/>number of important contributions to this field. The present proposal contains a<br/>new program of development for the representation theory of infinite dimensional<br/>symmetries which is especially relevant to the most advanced part of the existing<br/>theoretical physics that is supported by experimental physics; namely, 4 dimensional<br/>quantum field theory. Progress in this direction will enrich our understanding of<br/>the fundamental mathematical structures that lie at the foundation of the physical<br/>universe.<br/>

The models developed through this research<br/>will capture several unique features of AVS/R operations such as vehicle<br/>and lift interfacing, storage and retrieval interference effects, selective<br/>transaction dispatching, consolidated load buffering, and explicit linkage<br/>of S/R operations with in-process material flows. The proposed research<br/>will be conducted as a joint effort between Rensselaer Polytechnic<br/>Institute and University of Louisville, with active participation of<br/>industry. In terms of educational activities, this project will lead to<br/>multiple doctoral theses and undergraduate student research opportunities<br/>at the two participating universities.

Specifically,<br/>they develop boundary element methods for integral formulations <br/>of the Helmholtz equation, in which the basis functions are asymptotically<br/>derived. Each basis function is the product of a <br/>smooth amplitude and a highly oscillatory phase factor, like the asymptotic<br/>solution. <br/>The phase factor is determined a-priori by geometrical optics and the<br/>geometrical theory of diffraction, while the amplitude is a smooth function.<br/> This choice of oscillatory phase factor, ensures that the number of<br/>unknowns is virtually independent of the frequency. The basis functions<br/>being studied are designed in a way that the matrix, resulting from the<br/>discretization, has a number of significant entries which is proportional to<br/>the number of basis functions, in the large frequency limit. <br/>Hence, this matrix can be approximated with a sparse approximate <br/>matrix. The investigator and his colleagues explore the use of the sparse <br/>matrix instead of the original matrix, in order to obtain an approximate <br/>solution to the problem, and they study the solution of the approximate<br/>problem with iterative methods, and multi-grid methods. In addition they<br/>study the use of the sparse matrix as a preconditioner.<br/>This new methodology is being developed by studying problems of increasing<br/>complexity, such as convex domains with corners in two dimensions, and<br/>convex three dimensional domains. The impact of this research is therefore<br/>in the development of discretization schemes for the Helmholtz equation in <br/>which the number of unknowns is virtually independent of the frequency, and<br/>the design of optimally fast algorithms for solving those discrete problems.<br/>This transforms problems which are computationally exceedingly difficult if<br/>not intractable, into ones which are readily solved.<br/><br/>The solution of scattering problems has many applications in technology.<br/>Applications include remote sensing, ultra-sound imaging of tissue,<br/>non-destructive testing, geophysical prospecting, the design of reduced<br/>radar signature airplanes, and the determination of the acoustic signature<br/>of submersible vehicles. For the current configurations of interest,<br/>geometrical complications and/or compositional complexity in the underlying<br/>structure make manual solutions practically impossible. Moreover, in the mid<br/>to high frequency regime, standard computational approaches require an<br/>exceedingly large amount of calculations, leaving some problems<br/>computationally intractable. The fast and efficient algorithms for<br/>scattering problems developed by the investigator and his colleagues will<br/>broadly impact design and discovery tools in the application areas mentioned<br/>above.<br/><br/>

Newlon	06/30/2008	$258,532.00	Dirk Bergemann	smorris@princeton.edu	Office of Sponsored Projects	New Haven	CT	065208327	2037854689	SBE	1320	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The mechanism design literature of the last thirty years has been very successful. A wide range of institutional design questions, ranging from simple trading rules to political constitutions, have been analyzed and elegant optimal solutions have been obtained. Market design has become more important in many economic arenas, both because of new insights from theory and developments in information technology. Yet there has been an unfortunate disconnect between the general theory and the applications/empirical work: mechanisms that work in theory or are optimal in some class of mechanisms often turn out to be too complicated to be used in practise. Practitioners have then often been led to argue in favor ad hoc restriction which lead to simpler but apparently sub-optimal mechanisms. <br/><br/>The PIs will conduct research on mechanism design to answer this question.  They model robustness considerations by relaxing common knowledge assumptions in such a way that stronger solution concepts and simpler mechanism are endogenously created as robust optimal solution. In the first part of the project they consider design problems in which the objective of the designer is to maximize expected revenues and encompasses optimal monopoly pricing and optimal auctions. They introduce robustness consideration by allowing the principal to be uncertain about agents' beliefs and higher order beliefs about other agents' types. Subsequently, they will pursue a local version of the robustness analysis by requiring that the true distribution over valuations is within a range of a model distribution. In the second part they consider full rather than partial implementation. As private information may enable the agents to coordinate behavior in many different ways, the designer is concerned that there exists equilibrium behavior by the agents which does not realize his objective. The robust design then seeks to prevent equilibria, in the form of collusive behavior among the agents, which fail to realize the objective of the designer. <br/><br/>This research conceptualizes the notion of robustness for a wide class of mechanism design problems. It provides analytical instruments to evaluate how sensitive design rules are to strategic uncertainty. If successful, the techniques will provide solutions to specific design questions such as auctions and other allocation rules. <br/><br/>The theory of mechanism design is used with increasing frequency to solve real-life trading problems. It is then of foremost interest to understand how robust the theoretical solutions are to small variations in the environment. The goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of the performance of mechanisms such as bilateral trading and auctions rules. If successful, the techniques and solutions suggested will lend themselves to improve the performance of mechanisms and decrease their sensitivity to the specific features of the environment.  <br/>

This exploratory SGER project will develop algorithms for the design, simulation, and optimization of DMFS. These systems have the potential to perform complex biochemical analyses in real time at dramatically reduced costs. Their low energy requirements, small reagent volumes, and small size make them attractive for use in a wide variety of applications including medical diagnostics, clinical monitoring, and environmental monitoring. For example, such systems can be used as pathogen monitoring devices that sense and identify pathogenic organisms in the environment.<br/><br/>The proposed project will establish the validity of the novel approach by developing specialized routing and scheduling algorithms for the coordination of droplets on a DMFS, by exploiting the structure of these problems. By developing models abstracted from the hardware and focusing on the algorithms, basic principles will be developed for designing array layouts and coordinating droplets that work across different hardware implementations. The developed droplet routing and scheduling algorithms can be directly used in software to control a DMFS. Further, they will ultimately lead to high-level CAD tools to design and simulate DMFS.<br/><br/>This research will extend robot coordination techniques to biotechnology applications. The proposed research will involve graduate students in research, and will be integrated into a Robot Motion Planning course taught by the PI. Outreach activities include plans to enhance summer robotics camps with The Children's Museum of Science and Technology in Troy. <br/>

So robust a pattern has naturally attracted considerable attention and has resulted in numerous proposed explanations, for example, that ambient temperature is directly related to diversity. To help discriminate among these it is proposed to collect a new set of data by examining lizard diversity in the same geographic spot at different times in the geologic past, rather than studying diversity at the present time as it varies across space.  Remarkable climate change about 55 million years ago serves as an ideal background for this study. Seven localities in the sedimentary record of Wyoming have been selected for uniformity of preservation. The lizard species, most of them small and many of them new to science, will be described. Past temperature will be estimated using geochemical techniques on fossilized enamel. Species diversity and temperature will then be compared in order to determine if these two quantities are closely related or whether other explanations better account for the data. The proposed work has broader relevance for evaluating the potential effects of climate change, specifically global warming. This project will support the dissertation research of a doctoral candidate.<br/>

Specifically, the proposed work will focus on the design of fast efficient methods for (a) computing standard Nash equilibria with cost functions that are at best once differentiable, and (b) solving generalized Nash games (i.e., games with joint constraints), multi-leader-follower games (which include Stackelberg games, i.e., those with one leader and multiple followers), dynamic Nash games for which continuous-time solution trajectories and pathways of disequilibria are sought, Nash games with random elements (e.g., players' optimization problems are stochastic programs with recourse), as well as collusive games where players collude to<br/>increase their Nash payoffs.  We will also investigate the price of anarchy for some extended games on networks.  The application areas provide a rich source of open problems that encompass all the challenging features mentioned here: joint constraints, hierarchical structure, dynamics, stochastics, and collusion.<br/>

This collaborative project uses model rare-earth-alloy systems to understand the dependence of magnetic properties on nanometer-scale structural and chemical disorder.  The model systems will be prepared by different fabrication methods and structurally characterized using x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and synchrotron techniques.  Atomic-level and macroscopic magnetic measurements will be correlated to specific types of disorder.  These results will improve our understanding of the relationship between nanoscale disorder and magnetic properties in more complex materials, thus allowing us to develop improved materials for existing and future applications.  This collaborative project involves researchers from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and the University of Northern Iowa, the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. The project provides postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduate students with interdisciplinary training (including the use of facilities at national laboratories) in an area of critical national need.  Workshops and summer activities with Upward Bound math & science students, middle and high school teachers, and high-school students will help educate the future workforce about the importance of nanoscale materials.<br/><br/><br/>****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****<br/>Nanoscale inhomogeneity underlies many of the fundamental properties of systems such as colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials and high-Tc superconductors.  This collaborative project uses nanostructured rare-earth (RE) systems to investigate the relationship between magnetic properties and atomic-level disorder.  In particular, disordered RE Laves-phase materials will be prepared by mechanical milling, inert-gas condensation, and melt spinning. RE Laves-phase materials have magnetic characteristics similar to CMR and high-Tc materials, but are structurally simpler. Disorder (coordination number, mean interatomic distances, and variations in the interatomic distances), will be determined by x-ray diffraction and X-Ray Absorption Fine-Structure Spectroscopy (XAFS).  Atomic-level and macroscopic magnetic measurements, including magnetic XAFS, XMCD, and ac and dc magnetization, will be correlated to specific types of disorder.  Understanding how extrinsic properties such as coercivity depend on disorder will improve materials such as those used for permanent magnets and information storage.  Sample fabrication, DC magnetic measurements, and structural characterization will be done at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, while the University of Northern Iowa will be responsible for ac susceptibility measurements and analysis.  The broader impacts of this award include interdisciplinary research training for postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates.  Middle and high school teachers and high-school students will be impacted through workshops and summer programs that illustrate the role materials play in society. <br/>

This doctoral dissertation research improvement grant requests funds to visit to six archives in the United States. The object of each of these visits is to analyze documents unique to each archive that tell how a specific biologist or federal research commission studied aging (or, in the case of Barbara McClintock, influenced thinking about aging). The six archives are: the records of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (Washington, D.C.); the Nuclear Testing Archive of the Atomic Energy Commission (Las Vegas, N.V.); the Leo Szilard Papers (La Jolla, C.A.); the Leslie Orgel Papers (La Jolla, C.A.); the H.J. Muller Manuscripts Collection (Bloomington, I.N.); and the Barbara McClintock Papers (Philadelphia, P.A.). Permission to visit each archive and use the required documents has been obtained.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The intellectual merit of this research is threefold. First, it will enable the Co-PI to complete the dissertation. Second, it uses historical documents that have never been studied. Analysis of those documents will make a significant contribution to the history of gerontology and raise awareness of an important, neglected part of these major repositories' collections. Third, Crispin's research is highly interdisciplinary, reflecting the diversity of the sciences that were applied to the study of aging. The Co-PI has developed the expertise needed to conduct this research, and will further increase his interdisciplinary proficiency by visiting these archives.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>This dissertation significantly advances scholarship in the history of science in three ways. First, it moves the history of gerontology past 1930. Previous work by historians on the development of gerontology stops before molecular biology was established as a scientific field. Crispin's dissertation will extend the history of gerontology into the period of radiation biology, DNA, and molecular genetics, and will open the post-World War Two era of aging to research.  The dissertation adds a significant chapter to the history of molecular biology. Very little has been done on the influence of military radiation biology on molecular biology in the 1940s and 1950s; it has been overshadowed by the drama of the discovery of DNA. Only one other scholar is working on the topic, and that scholar is also in the first stages of research. Describing the influence of Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission and Atomic Energy Commission experiments and theories at this critical juncture will revise our understanding of the development of modern biology. Third, the dissertation provides one of the first in-depth studies of the molecularization of a sub-field of biology. Specialized areas such as gerontology and cancer became molecular sciences after molecular biology was well established. Little attention has been paid to the ways in which sub-fields within biology adopted the molecular paradigm, and how, in alliance with another sub-field or singly, they subtly influenced the direction of molecular biology as a whole. By making this transformation a central theme of his dissertation, the Co-PI will provide historians of science with a new way of thinking about the molecularization of biology and medicine.<br/>

University Avenue	Laramie	WY	820712000	3077665320	EHR	7427	9150, 9178, SMET	$0.00	<br/>A modular vertically integrated (longitudinal through the four year program) multidisciplinary (seen in classes in different departments) case study is being developed based on a single project that includes problems that are easily incorporated into lower and upper division engineering courses.  The case study problems increase in complexity with the student's engineering skill set allowing students to develop synthesis skills as their education advances.  The modules provide an opportunity for students to address larger problems than encountered in typical textbooks and to see the project multiple times from multiple perspectives. <br/><br/>The goals of this case study program are: increase interest (and retention) in engineering studies, advance the student's ability to work at higher cognitive domains and integrate the case study as a way to introduce students to the multidisciplinary aspect of design development.<br/>The project is developed around the design and operation of wind turbines.  The project approach consists of three elements.  First, case study modules are developed.  Second, the case studies are piloted simultaneously at the University of Wyoming, Laramie County Community College and Western Wyoming Community College.  Third, extensive assessments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the case studies to meet the project goals.<br/><br/>The project includes a significant project assessment activity to assist faculty and other engineering programs to adopt the integrated concept.  The assessment component constitutes approximately 40% of the sponsored faculty time commitment.  The assessment is to be conducted in five steps: problem learning objectives, class evaluations, focus groups, centralized tracking, and electronic portfolios.  The broader implication of this research is two fold.  First, the modular program structure allows adoption to be incremental rather than curricula wide.  Thus, trials at other schools become easier to implement.  Second, the evaluation program provides instructors with the best practices for adoption of the case studies in their own classes.  Complementing the technology, a MS student in History develops the historical model of wind turbine development, thus creating a cross over between the Arts and Science College and the College of Engineering.  Undergraduate engineering students are helping to develop the engineering master module and are involved in proof testing problems prior to sending them to the classroom.<br/>

Research and development efforts at IU will create the tools required for the Data Capacitor to be used to its fullest. Progress and research possibilities in many disciplines have been fundamentally changed by the abundance of data now so rapidly produced by advanced digital instruments. Scientists face the present challenge of drawing out from these data the information and meaning contained within. IU has established a significant cyberinfrastructure composed of high performance computing systems, archival storage systems, and advanced visualization systems spanning two main campuses in Indianapolis and Bloomington, and connected to national and international networks. This institution enhances its infrastructure in ways that will result in qualitative changes in the research capabilities and discovery opportunities of a broad array of scientist that work with large data sets. The Data Capacitor is expected to become a development platform and testbed for new cyberinfrastructure, as well as a proof of concept for large capacity, short-term storage devices. On the other hand, the Metadata/Web Services server enables the institution to establish a leadership position in standards-based data dissemination in many fields.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The Data Capacitor enhances current practice in relevant scientific communities, enables technology transfer and commercialization, develops a 21st century workforce, and ensures public understanding of the value of science. Deliberate use of objective metrics in all areas of broader impact ensures that new discoveries, technology development, educational activities, and public information efforts translate into benefit for the scientific community and society as a whole. Women and underrepresented groups will be drawn into computing-intensive sciences and applications of computing.<br/><br/>

Three methods will be developed and compared: utility-based statistical decision theory; an extension of utility theory based on Probability Bounds Analysis; and Information-Gap Decision Theory.  In these methods, the uncertainty due to natural random behavior in physical processes (aleatory uncertainty) and the uncertainty due to a lack of information (epistemic uncertainty) are considered explicitly.  The challenge is to determine which uncertainty representation is best suited for a particular combination of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties.  This is achieved through computational experiments, which will be validated in industrial case studies.  In addition, a method is developed to guide the efficient gathering of additional information when currently available information is insufficient to support a particular decision in Environmentally Benign Design and Manufacture.<br/><br/>This research will directly impact society by pursuing research that aims to reduce the environmental impact of industry while increasing its efficiency, creating an economic and ecological win-win situation.  It directly supports industry by developing new models, methods and tools that can be used to assess and reduce the environmental impacts during design and manufacture.  At the fundamental research level, this research will result in theoretical contributions toward the characterization of uncertain information and knowledge, and the ability to make decisions based on this uncertain information.  The research results will be integrated into several undergraduate and graduate courses.<br/>

A lack of creativity is problematic in a rapidly changing technology-oriented world where generating new ideas is essential to survival.  One of the industrial perceptions of weaknesses in new BS engineering graduates is a lack of design capability or creativity, and a lack of appreciation of considering alternatives. Further, a 1995 ASME report ranked creative thinking as 5th of 56 top desired best practices for new BS-level engineers as seen by industry and academe. In the past few years, universities have responded to this challenge by adding more design content and introducing more open-ended design problems into the engineering curriculum.  The most common approach to idea generation or creativity, however, has been the use of brainstorming that calls upon the designer to look inward for inspiration on creative solutions to the problem at hand.  This can be a daunting task, which may or may not be fruitful.  Systematic creativity methods such as the theory of inventive principles (TRIZ), guide the concept generation process using solution patterns derived from problems similar to the one being solved.  These methods are typically introduced in senior or graduate elective courses, if at all.  An EMD proof-of-concept grant from NSF would allow the faculty of the Engineering Design Program working with faculty in the Electrical, Industrial and Mechanical Engineering Departments at Penn State to develop materials that would facilitate teaching systematic creativity methods in four core undergraduate design courses: the first-year Introduction to Engineering Design course and the capstone design courses in the three participating departments.  Specifically, we propose (1) to develop systematic creativity modules and materials, based on the Theory of Inventive Principles (TRIZ), for the first-year introductory course and the three capstone courses, (2) to promote amongst the faculty an awareness and understanding of the TRIZ method, (3) to develop assessment and research strategies that would allow Penn State to contribute to the research knowledge on the teaching and learning of creativity using systematic creativity methods.  It is expected that the outcome of this work will result in materials widely applicable by other engineering departments and institutions looking to address the national need to increase the creative potential of future engineers. <br/><br/>Methods will be developed to address two pedagogical issues currently lacking solutions: (1) effective models and materials for introducing systematic creativity in core engineering courses; (2) a comprehensive research plan to study the effects of the introduction of systematic creativity methods on the creative potential of engineering graduates.  Key questions to be answered include: Can the introduction of systematic creativity result in a person learning to be more creative? To what extent does systematic creativity correlate with different learning styles or personality traits, both of which have been shown to contribute to a person's creative potential.  What are the best instruments to measure the effects of the intervention on a person's creative potential?  What effect would the intervention have on retention rates? <br/><br/>The materials developed will have impacts beyond the four targeted undergraduate courses.  An interactive on-line tool, based on one of the key TRIZ concepts, technical contradictions, is being developed as part of the proposal. The tool will be publicly available and populated with a large number of real-world examples, categorized by discipline.  This will go far beyond what is currently available and provide a valuable resource to other institutions and companies wishing to adopt the TRIZ approach.  In addition, the developed materials incorporate the language and analysis models common in engineering design (TRIZ has a large number of unique analysis models) thereby removing one of the barriers to wider adoption of the approach.  The materials will also be suitable for use in short courses in industry.  Finally, the outcomes of the research strategies and assessments will advance discovery and understanding of the teaching of creativity and the learning of creativity using systematic methods such as TRIZ.<br/>

Nanoparticles and nanocomposites offer unique properties that arise from their small size, large surface area, and the interactions of phases at their interfaces, and are attractive for their potential to improve performance of drugs, biomaterials, catalysts and other high-value-added materials. However, a major problem in utilizing nanoparticles is that they often lose their high surface area due to grain growth or unavailability of the high surface area where it matters. Creating nanostrauctured composites where two or more nanosized constituents are intimately mixed can prevent this loss in surface area, but in order to obtain homogeneous mixing, de-agglomeration of the individual nanoparticle constituents is necessary. A supercritical fluid (SCF), such as supercritical carbon dioxide, which has liquid-like density and solubility, yet gas-like diffusivity and viscosity, and is environmentally friendly, is an ideal medium for the purpose of deagglomerating nanoparticles because it can penetrate the pores within the nano-agglomerates, and upon rapid depressurization, can cause fragmentation and separation of the nanoagglomerates from within. The use of a SCF for producing well-mixed nanocomposites has a number of advantages: no organic solvents or even water is required, the processing is done at near room temperature, high levels of compressive stresses or friction forces are avoided, and since liquids are not used the cost of drying and solvent removal is eliminated, and substance purity is preserved. A combination of experiments and multiscale simulations, at three different length scales, is necessary to obtain a fundamental scientific understanding of the deagglomeration and subsequent mixing processes.  This award is aimed at developing such core knowledge that will advance the field of nano-materials.<br/><br/>Due to a comprehensive education and training program that includes students from K-12 through postgraduate levels, the project will have broader impacts in terms of workforce development and public awareness of nanotechnology. The experimental and theoretical research will provide predictive capabilities that will help in optimization and scale-up, and subsequent technology transfer to industrial partners. Thus this work has the potential to evolve into major enabling technologies for producing nanocomposites in large quantities, and contribute to establishing a leadership position for the US in the nanomixing area. To carry out this multidisciplinary research and educational objectives, a highly talented team of researchers from four universities (NJIT, Rutgers, Princeton and Auburn) has been assembled. This team is committed to building upon their past successes in research and in integrating diversity through a multi-pronged effort on recruitment, mentoring, and retention of underrepresented minority and women students. <br/><br/>

Rapid developments in wireless technologies and Sensor-network-based smart spaces are creating an urgent need for well-trained engineers in Pervasive Computing. Unfortunately, most universities have only graduate-level Pervasive Computing courses, which may not be suitable for undergraduate learning. Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is currently undertaking an effort to enhance the pervasive computing skills of our undergraduate students in two programs, Computer Engineering (in College of Engineering) and Computer Science (in College of Science). <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project is enhancing RIT undergraduate computing skills by adapting and implementing some of the exemplary Wireless & Mobile Computing lab environments at Benchmark Universities (Cornell, Rutgers and UIUC). RIT is establishing a Pervasive Computing Laboratory (PCL) that provides an integrated wireless-plus-wired networking platform, including current pervasive computing platforms such as Wireless LAN based on IEEE standard 802.11g, personal area networks based on Bluetooth technology and wireless sensor networks. The PCL is providing the Computer Engineering students with an understanding of computer networking issues on different mobile hardware platforms, and is providing the Computer Science students with an understanding of data management needs within pervasive computing environments. Three new courses (Pervasive Computing Architecture & Design, Principles of Wireless & Mobile Networks, and Data Management for Pervasive Computing) and a series of laboratory assignments are being developed to enhance the undergraduate curriculum of both majors. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The PCL is providing an excellent opportunity for the students and faculty to foster inter-college cooperation between two of the traditionally well-known undergraduate programs at RIT. By leveraging the multi-disciplinary character of RIT, the PCL is enhancing the diversity of pervasive computing skills in our nations' high-technology workforce since the students will be engaged in exploring several pervasive computing environments for monitoring/analyzing the physical world. In addition, RIT is using the PCL equipment and basic materials to train high school students through workshops. <br/>

Based on instrumental records, both the onset and total amount of NAM rainfall have oscillated over time, with a tendency towards increased variability in recent years. Given the interplay between ocean, atmosphere, and land that characterizes the NAM region, this research project aims at placing modern instrumental observations (which are limited to a few decades) within a longer temporal perspective in order to fully represent the range of NAM variability and improve our understanding of underlying processes and driving forces at annual to decadal scales. The researchers will obtain information on North American Monsoon variability over the past four centuries using stable isotope analysis of tree-ring records from two geographic endpoints of the NAM, namely Nevado de Colima, Mexico, at about 19 degrees N, and Great Basin National Park, USA, at about 39 degrees N. In addition, the investigators will perform an intensive monitoring of stem growth and climate using, respectively, automated dendrometers and weather stations. These sensors are already in place at Nevado de Colima, and the required equipment will be installed at Great Basin National Park. This research will provide detailed information on growing season length and daily to weekly relationships between radial growth and climate, information that is critical for correctly calibrating stable isotopic ratios against climate variability in the North American Monsoon region.<br/><br/>The North American tropics are a heavily populated area that is highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Water treaties between the US and Mexico concern the NAM region, are traditionally contentious, and are likely to be challenged in the coming years by rapid population growth and climatic changes. It is unclear if the eastern tropical Pacific, the western tropical Atlantic, or a combination of both supplies moisture for the summer monsoon. Sources of moisture may also change from one year to the next or on longer time scales. Project results will provide a long-term perspective to the North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME), a joint CLIVAR-GEWEX process study aimed at determining the sources and limits of predictability of warm season precipitation over North America. In addition, both study sites are located in mountain environments, where monitoring stations are scarce despite the vulnerability of these regions to natural and human disturbance. The proposed project will be coordinated with the Consortium for Integrated Climate Research in Western Mountains (CIRMOUNT), an interdisciplinary group of experts recently formed to promote climate-related science in mountainous regions. This project will strengthen collaboration between national (the Department of Geography at UNR, Great Basin National Park) and international (the Universidad de Colima in Mexico, the Institute of Chemistry and Dynamics of the Geosphere Sedimentary Systems in Julich, Germany) research and education institutions. Results will be broadly disseminated using a mix of presentations at professional meetings, multi-media talks during seminars and class lectures, articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals, materials posted on the PI's web site, and as one-on-one conversations during outreach programs aimed at secondary teachers and Latino/a students.<br/><br/>

Specific XRF upgrades will include a new beam filter, synthetic spectrometer crystals designed to allow for analysis of low atomic number element (e.g., B, C, N), and a new analysis software package.  The aerosol generation and deposition system will be assembled from commercially available equipment including an ultrasonic nebulizer, vacuum pumps, temperature controller and plumbing fixtures.  Research and research training activities that will employ this  instrumentation include: (1) training of undergraduate students in scientific research through courses in Geology,  Environmental Studies, Chemistry, Biology, and Safety Studies; (2) studies of the occurrence, transport, and environmental fate of toxic trace elements in river sediments; (3) characterization of ambient airborne fine particulate matter from different source regions; and (4) study of Neotropical migratory bird populations using combined trace element and stable isotope signatures to improve understanding of their ecology and biology.   KSC specializes in the training of undergraduates for future careers in K-12 teaching. This equipment will assist faculty in their efforts to engage students in hands-on research experiences of local relevance and is likely to stimulate student interest in scientific research and better prepare them for possible graduate study in the physical sciences.  It is noteworthy that roughly 1/3 of KSC students are first generation college students.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>

Professor Street	Oberlin	OH	440741090	4407758461	SBE	1353	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Abstract:<br/>In the years 1970-1985, the discipline of paleontology underwent a major transformation.  Despite its important role in the emergence of evolution  theory in the 19th century, paleontology was marginalized by the evolutionary community during much of the 20th.  Beginning in the 1970s, however, paleontologists began to make strong claims about the centrality of paleontology within evolutionary biology.  Several theories were advanced that argued the fossil record-the traditional domain of paleontologists-had genuine significance for understanding the mechanisms of evolution.  The new field defined by this work was called 'paleobiology,' and its proponents- Stephen Jay Gould, David Raup, Thomas J.M. Schopf, and Steven Stanley-became important figures in evolutionary theory.  <br/><br/>Intellectual Merits<br/>This project will document the 'renaissance' in paleontology by collecting and examining archival documents, analyzing published scientific literature, and conducting interviews with paleontologists and biologists who participated in these events.  The goal is a book documenting and analyzing the 'paleobiological renaissance' of the 1970's.  This will be the first major historical study of recent paleobiology.  The core of the book is an institutional and intellectual account of the key figures who actively (and self-consciously) promoted disciplinary transformation, and the conceptual, pedagogical, and strategic/political steps these scientists took to establish their work in evolutionary theory.  This project argues that this did not happen accidentally, but rather through rhetorical persuasion, institutional positioning, and sheer toil, as key figures attempted to build a new sub-discipline.  An important feature of this development was the disciplinary alliances between paleontology and  biology, ecology, and molecular genetics.  By the late 1980s, paleobiology had successfully integrated itself into the mainstream of evolutionary research.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>In addition to contributing to the literature on the history of modern paleontology, this project will be relevant to historians, philosophers, and scientists interested in the development of modern evolutionary theory, as well as to educators.  Within history, the themes of intellectual self-promotion, and institutional politics will be valuable as a case study in modern scientific disciplinary transformation.  This will be a book that can be assigned to students in history of science and science courses.  It will be instructive about the content of recent evolutionary theory and the nature of scientific change.  It will be useful for non-science majors who desire an overview of complex recent developments in evolutionary thought.  It will also serve an additional pedagogical role by illustrating that revisions to evolutionary theory introduced during the paleobiological revolution of the 1970s demonstrate the stability and robustness of Darwinian evolution.  In   This project will promote collection and preservation of oral interviews and documents not currently available to scholars and educators, and potential dissemination of these materials at a central archive and/or as electronic resources. <br/>

Recently some four-membered ring compounds containing alternating boron and phosphorus atoms have been shown to exist as singlet diradicals.  This project aims to extend the range of such compounds that behave as diradicals and determine the factors that control the diradical character. Improved syntheses of PBPB diradicals will be devised to provide a range of compounds. These will be used to evaluate the influence of substituents on the relative energy and on the singlet/triplet gap of the diradicals. To increase the diradical character, singlet diradicals will be formed as extended oligomers. Finally, new families of diradicals based on boron, carbon, and other group 14 atoms will be sought. The synthetic investigations will be guided by theoretical predictions.<br/><br/>The availability of diradicals that can be handled under standard laboratory conditions will raise the likelihood of practical applications, such as conductive non-metallic materials. Additionally, this project is at the interface between physical, organic and inorganic chemistry and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels. Reflecting the University of California - Riverside's classification as a minority serving institution, a diverse student body will be involved in the project. This research will also promote collaborative research and the exchange of undergraduates, graduates and postdoctoral fellows between UC Riverside and several French universities.<br/><br/>

Under NSF EMT Proposal Scalable DNA molecular computation a team of scientists and students at the University of California, Riverside will investigate the possibility of making a large-scale neural network computer based on the interactions of DNA molecules. The research team includes the principle investigator, Professor Allen Mills from the Department of Physics, Professor Jerome Schultz from the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering and several graduate and undergraduate students. The possibility of doing practical computations using groups of a few molecules as computing elements is intriguing because one might be able to make molecular computers much more powerful than any electronic computer known today. This is because DNA molecules of the required size are billions of times smaller in volume than the smallest feature on a modern computer chip, so that the DNA equivalent of a powerful microprocessor could in principle fit into a tiny droplet of liquid. One can easily project that a DNA computing machine with the physical size of a laptop could contain millions of such droplets that would have a composite computing power exceeding that of a human brain. <br/>The first indication that computing could be done with DNA molecules came in 1994 when Prof. Len Adleman, working at UCLA, dramatically demonstrated that certain reactions, in which various DNA molecules in solution find, recognize and bind to complementary DNA molecules, may be utilized for the purpose of doing computations with molecules.  It is encouraging that Adleman and his coworkers have recently used a related scheme to solve a problem involving one million different DNA molecules.<br/>One stumbling block on the path to the enormous computing potential of DNA is the anticipated accumulation of errors in a computation due to imperfect molecular reactions. The new NSF proposal seeks to achieve Scalable DNA molecular computation by configuring a DNA molecular computer as a brain-like neural network, a computing architecture that uses redundancy to make it inherently fault tolerant and therefore possibly scalable to virtually any size.  <br/>The first practical neural network architecture, and one that is perhaps ideal for testing a DNA neural network, is the content-addressable memory neural network invented by Prof. John Hopfield at Cal Tech and Bell Labs in the early 1980's. In the first phase of the proposal, the students under the guidance of their mentors will learn how to use biochemical reactions naturally occurring in living cells to make the necessary components for a DNA neural network.  In the second phase of the work, a small-scale molecular computer will be made to demonstrate the principle of operation of a DNA neural network. Plans will be drawn up for scaling this network up by an order of magnitude to search for size limitations in this type of molecular computing. <br/>The prospect of making neural networks with a size approaching that of a human brain is very intriguing and raises interesting questions about how one would program or train a very large network, how it would communicate, whether its operation could be autonomous and whether it could exhibit self-organization and emergent behavior.<br/>The proposed work will demonstrate whether DNA neural networks could be competitive with other technologies in certain niches. One of the most important applications could be the use of DNA neural networks trained to recognize the DNA signatures of certain cancer cell types and for performing inexpensive genetic profiling tests to determine the susceptibility of people to a spectrum of the most common diseases such as various cancers, asthma, diabetes and hemochromatosis where dozens of genetic defects in different combinations may be involved. Thus even if giant networks prove to be infeasible, the eventual beneficiaries of relatively small networks may be patients that would receive improved therapy based on the availability of an inexpensive and rapid diagnostic tool, and the general populace who will be able to adjust their lifestyles based on genetic knowledge. The prospects for large DNA neural networks are uncertain at this time, but in principle they could be the basis for an entirely new computing paradigm. In any case, the proposed research will provide excellent training for two PhD students and several undergraduate students in the emerging field of biophysics at a University noted for its large component of students from minority backgrounds. <br/>

Although the language is severely endangered, there is enormous interest in language revitalization withinthe Gwich'in community. These efforts are supported in part by Gwich'in language courses at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. However, in spite of a rich history of linguistic documentation of Gwich'in, there is no accessible reference or pedagogical grammar of Gwich'in. In fact, there is no published comprehensive grammatical description for any of the eleven Athabascan languages of Alaska.<br/><br/>With funding from NSF this project will create a pedagogical grammar of the Gwich'in language for use by students and scholars. The grammar will serve as a key component of the developing Gwich'in language curriculum at the Alaska Native Language Center. In addition, the grammar will provide a primary scholarly resource documenting the structure of a typologically unusual language. The grammar will be accompanied by a Curriculum Guide to aid in the teaching of Gwich'in grammar in language classes. This guide may serve as a model that may be adapted for other languages. In addition, interested K-12 language teachers and language learners may find the model beneficial for their own use.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

This conference provides a forum for presenting and discussing the best research, scholarship, and creative work of  undergraduate students from local community colleges, public and private four-year institutions, as well as students from a few high schools.  Presenters showcase results from Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) (including the REU Site for Plant Cell Biology at UCR), the NIST Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship, and many other opportunities sponsored by agencies, foundations, and academic institutions.  SCCUR attracts more than 500 student participants per year. A significant majority of student presentations are in research fields supported by the NSF, notably the biological sciences, social/behavioral sciences, the physical sciences including math and chemistry, and engineering. In 2004, students from 106 institutions participated; these included 25 Minority-serving Institutions (24 Hispanic Serving and one Historically Black College), and 24 community colleges.  This award will assist SCCUR in providing a unique opportunity for students and teachers from divergent communities and academic backgrounds to meet and share in the excitement of research-based discovery.  It opens lines of communications among individuals and institutions that encourages more student activity in research, particularly those from underrepresented communities, to pursue higher studies in the sciences and engineering. <br/><br/>The UC Riverside event is particularly important because it will be held for the first time in a part of Southern California that lags in economic opportunity and college matriculation rates. The students, faculty, and families who attend will see an ethnically diverse campus that strongly supports undergraduate research opportunities. UCR will highlight its research strengths, which include leading-edge work in plant genomics, and will offer tours of the Center for Plant Cell Biology and other science facilities.  Specific goals of this grant are to buy down the cost of admission to this years event, which will enable more students to participate. Special emphasis will be directed at increasing community college and high school student participation.  Funds also will support event operating costs and provide take-home materials.  Our intent is to show students from two-year colleges and those from disadvantaged backgrounds that bachelor and graduate programs will eagerly welcome them if they maintain their interest in science. In the long term, these efforts will contribute in expanding the diversity of the science and engineering workforce. <br/>

Lack of infrastructure, intermittent connectivity, and frequent changes in topology due to mobility present significant challenges in the research of MANETs. While most prior efforts were primarily focused on the networking layer, there are compelling reasons supported by recent information theory and signal processing studies which indicate that an integrated approach seeking cross-layer diversity exploitation can lead to more fruitful results. This project follows that path. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop a framework of communication, networking, and signal processing techniques for MANETs by exploiting node cooperation at the physical, medium access, and networking layers. Three different but intertwined research directions are involved, Specifically, the first is to develop a distributive modulation theory over wireless relay channels, covering investigation of the characteristics of wireless relay channels, modulation and detection for coherent, differential and non-coherent communications for relay networks, power allocation and placement of relay nodes. The second direction is to develop bandwidth-efficient and delay-tolerant cooperative coding schemes to address several issues that are unique in coded cooperation, including bandwidth expansion caused by repetitive transmissions from relays, node asynchronism due to distributive locations of relays, and scalability (viz., the capability to degrade gracefully when some cooperating nodes that implement a distributive code fail because of fading). The third direction is to explore networking by parallel relays and develop networking protocols that take into account the realistic characteristics of radio signals and provide a flexible framework for diversity exploitation. <br/><br/><br/>
0514150	Dissertation Research: Water resource management in rural Bolivia after decentralization	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY	07/01/2005	09/12/2005	Thomas Patterson	CA	University of California-Riverside	Standard Grant	Deborah Winslow	06/30/2006	$11,000.00		thomas.patterson@ucr.edu	Research & Economic Development	RIVERSIDE	CA	925210217	9518275535	SBE	1390	9179, SMET	$0.00	The Bolivian government has recently shifted power and decision-making from the state to the municipality, including funding for and jurisdiction over water resource management. Proponents of decentralization assert that it has enhanced local participation and empowered rural regions by giving local representatives veto power over municipal budgets. Critics argue that decentralization has only reinforced the power of local elites, amplified inequalities, eroded broad-based national alliances, and dissolved the power of community-based agrarian unions. This dissertation research by a cultural anthropologist studies the new Lahuachama irrigation project in the municipality of Totora, Cochabamba, where eleven communities are united under an irrigation system. The study will analyze this new system and the changing patterns of water management, community organization, and local politics within and across community borders. <br/>Research will begin with 88 interviews with male and female participants conducted throughout the municipality to examine the social processes governing the new irrigation project, to assess the diversity of management practices found within the system. Then two representative communities will be studied for information about users and non-users of the irrigation system. This second phase of research will involve participant observation, the collection of oral histories from key informants, and interviews from 100 households. <br/>Broader impacts: In addition to furthering the education of a doctorial student, this research will provide a richer understanding of the changing nature of peasant community organization and water resource use. By examining the local effects of administrative decentralization on rural Bolivian community members and their management of water resources, this research will inform future policy and empower rural agrarian communities. <br/>

Of equal <br/>importance is the need to preserve and provide access to existing <br/>documentation, particularly audio recordings. For many endangered <br/>languages archival recordings document speech patterns and features <br/>which are no longer present in the modern language. Archival recordings <br/>can thus provide an invaluable resource for language learners and <br/>researchers in order to assist with language revitalization and <br/>documentation efforts. However, in many cases existing archival <br/>recordings are themselves in danger of decay and are often relatively <br/>inaccessible. This is particularly true for the indigenous languages of <br/>the North. By far the largest collection of recordings documenting <br/>Northern languages is housed at the Alaska Native Language Center <br/>(ANLC), and many of the older recordings in this collection are in <br/>danger of decay and are not readily accessible by indigenous language <br/>communities.<br/><br/>With NSF funding this project is creating a digital archive of more <br/>than 1000 Central Alaskan Yup'ik audio recordings, drawing on the <br/>extensive archival tape collection held at ANLC. The project will serve <br/>as a pilot in order to assess the feasibility of developing a <br/>large-scale digital archive for the indigenous languages of the <br/>circumpolar North and neighboring regions. The Northern Indigenous <br/>Languages Archive (NILA) is intended as a premier demonstration center <br/>for digital archiving, complementing prominent international efforts to <br/>develop regional digital language archives. Recordings will be <br/>digitized according to technical standards developed by the Library of <br/>Congress, and digital recordings will be stored at the Arctic Region <br/>Supercomputing Center. Catalog descriptions (metadata) will be made <br/>available in order to facilitate web-based searching and discovery of <br/>digital resources, which will then be accessible directly via a <br/>web-based interface.<br/><br/>

The project focuses on two different methods for investigating the stability of solitary waves.  The first technique is to use linearization of the equation written in evolution form and to prove stability based on convexity of a certain function of the wave speed.  The second technique is to use variational methods to simultaneously establish both existence and stability of solitary waves.  The project emphasizes study of stability in the nonlinear Schrodinger equations, dispersion managed nonlinear Schrodinger equations, and discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equations that are related to the study of diffraction managed waveguide arrays.  The project will also investigate existence and regularity of attractors for Benjamin-Bona-Mahoney and Camassa-Holm type equations.<br/><br/>Most important physical phenomena are described by partial differential equations, some of which can be viewed as dynamical systems on an infinite dimensional space.  The goal of this work is to analyze, via this viewpoint, the qualitative behavior of solutions to a class of partial differential equations that arise in numerous physical situations.  A primary example under study in this work is the envelope equation describing an electromagnetic wave propagating in an optical waveguide.  As a consequence of a balance between nonlinear and dispersive effects, the equation possesses pulse-like solutions called optical solitons.  Research in the field of optical solitons is one of the most exciting areas of research in nonlinear science, since self-guided waves (solitons) are ideal candidates for use in the next generation of optical communication networks.  This research will deepen our understanding of the waves and coherent structures in nonlinear models of this phenomenon and others of physical importance.  The project will also enable undergraduate and graduate students to be involved in modern interdisciplinary mathematics.<br/>
0518294	The Consequences of Foreign Military Intervention in Developing Countries, 1960-2005	SES	SOCIOLOGY, EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES	07/15/2005	07/20/2005	Emizet Kisangani	KS	Kansas State University	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	06/30/2007	$87,069.00	Jeffrey Pickering	emizetk@ksu.edu	2 FAIRCHILD HALL	Manhattan	KS	665061100	7855326804	SBE	1331, 9150	0000, 9150, OTHR	$0.00	Foreign military intervention is one of the most important political phenomena in the<br/>world today. As major wars have declined in frequency over recent decades and the efficacy of<br/>costly and time-consuming economic sanctions is questioned, foreign military intervention seems<br/>to have become a sine qua non of modern statecraft. Despite the growing prevalence of foreign<br/>military intervention, we still have little understanding of the type of impacts this typically lowscale force has in target countries. As the recent American involvement in Iraq underscores, FMI can have major ramifications in target states. This project takes an initial step toward<br/>understanding the effects that foreign military intervention has on developing states' governing<br/>institutions, their economic performance, and their citizens' quality of life. To date, no systematic, large N studies of foreign military intervention impact on target states have been undertaken.<br/>Given its growing frequency and importance, this is a noteworthy gap in the literature. Of course,<br/>a study of intervention impacts faces numerous obstacles. The literature on the rarer and much<br/>more heavily studied phenomenon of war underscores some of these barriers. Because of the<br/>inertia that typically characterizes research programs, the bulk of extant research on war focuses<br/>on its initiation. Many scholars hope that by grasping how wars break out, they can also learn how to prevent them. The result is that scant analytical energy has been spent into developing<br/>knowledge of war consequences. Broadly accepted theories on war impacts are scarce.<br/>Methodologically, there is little consensus on how far into the postwar period analysts should look for war impacts, or which of the myriad of different impacts should be given emphasis.<br/>Wars are obviously easier to spot and to study than foreign military interventions. They<br/>are larger and bloodier. They wreak greater havoc on national infrastructure and populations. If<br/>war impact studies are in their infancy, it might seem that the chances of building a systematic<br/>understanding of intervention consequences are remote. After all, intervention studies tend to<br/>follow the example set by the more prominent study of war. Except for a growing literature on<br/>third party interventions in civil conflicts, intervention studies also tend to focus on initiation. The investigators,  however, believe that the study of intervention consequences is not only feasible, it is overdue. With a consistent, reliable operationalization of the concept of foreign military intervention and carefully collected data on the phenomenon, intervention impacts can be studied systematically. What's more, since intervention is more a varied phenomenon than war, they should be able to ascertain a range of different types of impacts and construct typologies. Unlike war, foreign military intervention can be launched in support of, rather than opposition to, target governments. It can be taken for humanitarian reasons, to rescue beleaguered nationals in troubled foreign lands, or simply to chase bands of rebels across borders. In other cases, it can challenge and even seek to oust the target government. Where they leave a measurable imprint, such varied military missions should have vastly different social, political, and economic ramifications for target societies. <br/>The most daunting obstacle for the project has yet to be addressed: data. The funding from the National Science Foundation is to update the most frequently used data on foreign<br/>military intervention, Pearson and Baumman's (1993) International Military Intervention (IMI)<br/>dataset. IMI is a broad measure of low-scale force that records all verifiable cases when national<br/>troops or forces move into another country's territory to pursue political, economic, or strategic<br/>objectives. The IMI data housed in ICPSR only covers the years 1946 to 1988. One of this<br/>project's PIs has extended the data to 1996. They have funding to extend it further to 2005. They<br/>will complete the update in one calendar year, starting 1 June 2005 and ending 31 May 2006. The<br/>data will be deposited at ICPSR. Its benefits will thus outlive the current project on intervention<br/>consequences. The data will have a broad impact on the fields of comparative politics and IR by<br/>providing a reliable, accessible dataset on the most prevalent type of military force in use today.<br/>Given the wide variety of activities recorded, scholars from across the globe can use the data to<br/>test a host of different theories and relationships. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the<br/>fact that it will help bring understanding to a phenomenon that will be prevalent and may have far reaching consequences in coming decades, foreign military intervention.<br/><br/>

The research on these connections involves invariants that<br/>are related to number theory and algebraic K-theory, and machine<br/>computation has been an important component of the research. The main<br/>tool is the program Snap, and another important aspect of the project<br/>is further development of this program. The PI will also continue his<br/>investigation of commensurability properties of 3-manifolds.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses some long-term open questions concerning<br/>3-dimensional space forms.

Eminent scientists in linguistics, speech, cognitive-developmental psychology, and education at Haskins Laboratories, the sponsoring institution, will mentor and instruct the Fellow in areas in which she lacks expertise, including quantitative analyses and cognitive bases of reading. The sponsoring scientist, Hollis Scarborough, is a cognitive-developmental psychologist with extensive experience in conducting research on the development of oral and written language skills, including the relationship of dialect differences to early reading achievement. Sociolinguists have clearly demonstrated not only that our speech reveals much about ethnic and geographic origins, but also that listeners reliably attribute racially stereotyped traits to speakers based on perceptions of dialect, particularly African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). AAVE speakers are consistently judged, by listeners of all races, to be less intelligent and less educated than speakers of so-called standard American English (SAE). Although the social and occupational consequences of such stigmatization have received much attention, the educational ramifications of dialect differences have been infrequently studied. Yet these might be crucial factors in explaining the longstanding and persistent racial achievement gaps in reading and other academic areas among America's schoolchildren. Elementary school teachers will be asked to make judgments about speaker characteristics after listening to brief speech samples from young children who vary widely in their use of particular AAVE features and overall density of those features. In addition to the morphosyntactic and phonological forms that have been the focus of much sociolinguistic analysis, AAVE intonation patterns will also be examined because they too may be stigmatized. Judgments will be made by teachers who differ in social background, race, age, region, and teaching experience with African- American children. By administering the procedure both online and in person, it will be possible to recruit a large and diverse sample of teacher-judges. Opportunities will also be provided for teachers to provide comments and questions about the child speakers, so that qualitative analyses can also be performed to aid the interpretation of quantitative findings. The results will reveal whether teachers judge students more negatively, and if so, along what dimensions, when particular kinds of AAVE features are present or when there is a high density of multiple features in the child's speech. This will permit a determination of the relative salience and stigmatization of particular aspects of AAVE, which may vary across teachers depending on their experience, race, or region. Gaining this understanding of how teachers perceive and interpret dialect differences will not only be theoretically informative but will also serve as a guide to designing professional development programs to increase teachers' knowledge and acceptance of AAVE. This research will also contribute to the sociolinguistic literature on how notions of the standard language are formed within a speech community. The language standard used in schools is closely related to the sociolinguistic concepts of hypercorrection and social norms in the speech community. Thus, it is crucial to determine the role that educational institutions play in the construction of communicative competence and social mobility. Despite the fact that African-Americans are disproportionately represented among struggling readers, there are few minority researchers studying this achievement gap in a manner that combines theoretical and methodological approaches drawn from linguistics, speech, cognitive-developmental psychology, and education.<br/><br/>

Bamboos are economically important as building materials and household items (among many other uses) and are ecologically significant as a key component of many remnant habitats that preserve threatened and endangered plant and animal species.  Despite this importance, bamboo diversity and evolutionary relationships (= family tree or phylogeny) are poorly known relative to other grasses and bamboo classification remains unstable.  These issues create difficulties for biologists, conservationists, and those interested in developing bamboo as a sustainable resource.  The principal goals of this project are to 1) generate a phylogeny for the bamboos using DNA data, data on the physical structure of bamboos, and innovative analytical and statistical methods; 2) construct a stable classification of bamboos at the genus level that reflects this phylogeny; 3) use the phylogeny to study the evolution and biology of selected features (such as vegetative branching) of these unusual grasses; 4) establish an umbrella Web site for bamboo biodiversity to host a comprehensively illustrated and interactive identification resource to the genera of bamboos and to make information on bamboo biodiversity more readily available to users around the world.  An international team of bamboo biologists (the Bamboo Phylogeny Group) with complementary expertise will be established to achieve these goals.<br/>           <br/>This collaborative effort will result in a much-improved understanding of the evolutionary history and biodiversity of bamboos.  A stable generic classification will facilitate communication about bamboos and in conjunction with an accessible identification resource will be valued by a wide range of users, including ecologists, conservation biologists, foresters, biologists, bamboo enthusiasts, architects, engineers, and others interested in developing bamboo as a sustainable resource.  Graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in plant classification and the construction of phylogenies (both important components of systematic biology) as well as current techniques of DNA manipulation and bioinformatics through participation in all phases of the project.  Improvements and innovations in analytical methods that result from this project will be applicable to a wide range of fields that use bioinformatics or phylogenetic methods, such as developmental genetics, conservation genetics, genomics, and medical research. Existing museum and living collections will be strengthened through the fieldwork.  Results will be widely disseminated to both the general public and the scientific community through presentations, publications, and the Bamboo Biodiversity Web site.<br/> <br/>

Specifically, this study aims to discover how migrant women conceive of their built environment and how far ways of knowing, indigenous concepts and structures are reflected in spatial arrangements, built settlements, and household dwellings framed within a process commonly known as urbanization and modernity. Several of Guam's key geographical, social, and demographic characteristics make it ideal to realize such research aims. Guam, a territory of the United States, lies geographically in Micronesia and has a population of just under 155,000 (US Bureau of the Census 2000). The FSM citizens on Guam make up slightly over seven percent of this number and constitute the fastest growing migrant community (Rubinstein and Levin 1992). They are in the process of creating enclave communities where social interaction, as well as the visible emergence of new, resisted, or transformed domestic arrangements and forms of sociability encourages ethnographic study. The FSM is comprised of four states: Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosrae. The post-doctoral fellow has chosen to focus on women from one state, Chuuk, because its nationals make up the largest proportion (72 percent: US Bureau of the Census 2000) of FSM migrants on Guam. The project reflects theoretical concerns with gendered and indigenous notions of space. A  goal is to deepen theoretical understanding where epistemology and methodology meet through field strategies that evince a holistic, in-depth treatment of an enclave community, from the inside out and from the bottom up, as distinct from statistical extrapolation of numbers and attributes of community migrants (Chapman 1987; Mitchell 1983). Building on past experience, observation, interviewing, and recording will proceed with specific reference to 1) indigenous concepts and structures of spatial mobility, 2) the manner is which migrant women both create and find their behavior influenced by their dwellings, and 3) broader processes of cultural activity and identity among migrant women in the urban setting. The proposed project extends doctoral research on the atoll of Satowan (Chuuk). In attempting to write about social or cognitive space as a framework for a more comprehensive understanding of mobility, the researcher argues that reducing  people to the label 'migrant,' or to the idea they are simply and characteristically 'rural' or 'urban,' speaks little to how Satowan society define mobility. There are, for example, many attributes of mobility more closely associated with strong thought, high thought, no roots, self-centeredness, false wandering, and journeys without purpose that capture meanings of movement far more effectively than prevailing theories of attraction to the bright light,' urban drift, education explosion, or apparent boredom among young people. The broader impacts from the proposed activity are both specific and general. A major,<br/>practical outcome of this research will be to design and offer a workshop to run for the two consecutive summers during the length of the project oriented to professionals, students, and agencies in urban housing and land-use planning. This workshop will encourage improved understanding of women's roles in the urban environment, with specific reference to planning strategies for low-income households and community participation. Visits to migrant enclaves on the island will assess the applicability of the women and development literature to actual field situations. In-depth field instruments incorporated into and assessed throughout the proposed study could enhance treatment of ethnographic methods within each of my Family and Gender courses at the University of Guam. A more general outcome of project findings will be to foster effective policies for migrants in both the local Government of Guam and the federal US Department of the Interior. Information on housing, as a form of shelter, gives glimpses into the daily lives of migrants and how people come together to construct settlements and household dwellings. The allocation of money by the US Department of Interior and the social costs of immigration to the Government of Guam would be assisted by the stability and vulnerability of migrant households, residential patterns, migrant employment, female-headed households, and the economic roles played by women.<br/><br/>

Chowdhury	08/31/2007	$110,000.00				Ann Arbor	MI	481091259		SBE	1397	1036, 9179, SMET	$0.00	Given the substantial presence of Latinos in the U.S., their academic underachievement is highly problematic because it leaves them, on average, under-prepared for higher education and less likely to attain economic and occupational outcomes associated with higher educational attainment. The overarching objective of this Social and Behavioral Sciences Minority Post-Doctoral Fellowship research and training activity is to increase understanding of processes associated with variation in academic outcomes among Latinos. This objective will be accomplished using the data and resources of the New York University Center for Research on Culture, Development and Education (CRCDE, currently funded by the National Science Foundation), an interdisciplinary, multiple method center dedicated to examining cultural and ecological influences on the academic outcomes of diverse youth in New York City. Quantitative and qualitative data will be used to test the extent to which one prevalent minority achievement framework adequately explains differences in achievement processes within Latino groups and between Latinos and other minority groups. The examination of these issues entails advanced methodological training in mixed methods approaches which will be  undertaken via coursework and participation in seminars offered by the university and the CRCDE.  Across the disciplines of psychology, sociology, anthropology and education, one prevalent framework for explaining the academic underachievement of minority youth, including Latinos, suggests that educational outcomes are a function of social barriers, such as group discrimination and societal devaluation of ethnic minority groups, which lock youths' opportunities for educational attainment. This framework has not been extensively tested among Latinos, whose educational experiences have been characterized by social exclusion but whose members vary in their history and status in the U.S. Therefore, a major contribution of the research is that it will test the adequacy of the blocked-opportunities framework for explaining academic outcomes among Latinos. Furthermore, because the blocked-opportunities framework assumes that students' perceptions of barriers for their particular social groups are also, consciously or otherwise, what they believe about their personal barriers, it does not account for within group variability in the influence of social barriers on academic outcomes. A second major contribution of this research is that it will test this assumption by developing measures of perceived personal barriers. The extent to which differences in academic outcomes are a function of perceived personal barriers, rather than group barriers, will subsequently be examined.  The training period at the NYU CRCDE will facilitate the fellow's collaboration with a network of interdisciplinary faculty and students that includes several distinguished minority scholars. The fellowship entails participation in research activities, seminars and coursework that will enhance understanding of the use of multiple methods for examining within and between-group differences in academic outcomes among minority youth. The development of perceived personal barriers measures, especially among Latinos, will provide knowledge that will help translate research findings into intervention efforts. Knowing how youth view personal barriers to educational attainment is essential in developing programs and policies to help Latinos become more adequately prepared to participate and succeed in higher education. The findings from the research studies conducted will be disseminated to a wide range of audiences interested in promoting the academic achievement of groups traditionally underrepresented in higher education, including the research community, schools and parents, educational practice and policy organizations, and to the general public through the CRCDE website.<br/><br/>

The proposed research has two primary components: examining changing cooking technologies, and exploring the potential of a collaborative Indigenous archaeology methodology. It involves comparative case studies in Turkey and North America with fieldwork in two locations: Catalhoyuk, Turkey and the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Reservation of Michigan. In each case, the aim is to better understand the production, use-life, and social significance of cooking paraphernalia and the changing practices associated with them through time. Significant cultural changes occurred during the time periods of examination in each location, and the study focuses on how these transformations are reflected and/or driven by changing foodways. The proposed research in Turkey expands on previous analyses of clay cooking balls from Catalhoyuk to include comparative examination of ovens and hearths from 6 Neolithic sites in the same region. The resulting analysis will provide a rigorous yet rich, contextualized examination of changing cooking practices of hunter-gatherer and early farming communities in Anatolia. The proposed research in Michigan will be the first stage of a new, long-term fully collaborative endeavor with the Saginaw Chippewa Indian community. The Fellow will assemble a community team, and work with them to develop an archaeological research design that aims to examine pre- and post-contact cooking techniques in Michigan from 1000 BC to the present.  In both Turkey and Michigan, projects include an Indigenous archaeology component to examine collaborative methodologies through case studies in both regions that will be carried out in conjunction with the cooking research outlined above. The aim is to put theoretical models of archaeological collaboration into practice, and to measure their effectiveness in producing knowledge that is useful to stakeholders and the archaeological community. In Turkey this involves collaborating with Turkish community members, teachers, and other stakeholders to develop a long-term community-led heritage plan, with the aim of making the Catalhoyuk research accessible and useful to them. In Michigan, the aim is to blend Western and Indigenous epistemologies to develop a detailed plan for future archaeological research that satisfies both Indigenous collaborators and the archaeological science community. The results will provide comparative data for using an Indigenous collaborative methodology, within and outside of an Indigenous land-base.<br/>With this postdoctoral opportunity the Fellow will produce data that forms the basis of numerous journal articles and two books. Completing these projects is critical for the development of the Fellow's long-term research plans, and will significantly advance my career goals. Dr. Hodder and the scholarly community at Stanford are integral to the Fellow's research in areas of heritage management, multi-locality, and post-colonial and decolonizing theory, and are critical resources for the proposed research.<br/><br/>

Specific steps of the project are: 1) detailed study of all the environmental factors that influence failures on distribution feeders, 2) investigate and seek models to represent the effects of these factors on failures on distribution feeders, 3) investigate methodologies to identify feeders that have high probability of failures due to exposure to environmental factors, 4) investigate methodologies to compare actual performance of the feeders with expected performance based on selected models, 5) use Westar Energy distribution system as a test bed to validate the models and methodologies, and 6) develop modules based on the research for inclusion in three courses. <br/><br/>Innovative methodologies for accurate reliability evaluation of distribution systems will be investigated, which will advance the frontier of knowledge in the field of reliability evaluation.  This research addresses an important problem with significant broader relevance to society. Specifically, this work could lead to improved reliability of distribution systems, where most electric power interruptions arise. The collaboration between university and industry will facilitate enhancement of the research infrastructure.  The project will introduce new multi-disciplinary perspectives to the participating students.  <br/>

These lakes are unique in their age, stratification, perennial ice cover, and location in closed basins. The consequence of these factors is a high susceptibility to climate change, which their stratified waters record in much the same way that sedimentary rocks record geologic processes. This project will sample three lakes from varied settings. Water samples will be analyzed for major ions, dissolved gases, stable isotopes, and isotopes of helium, chlorine and iodine, each of which offers a unique perspective on the water's source, age, and recent communication with the atmosphere. Results will be coupled with information on lake levels, hypolimnia formations, and ice cover occurrence to understand lake history and Holocene climate.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this work supports graduate and undergraduate research, and development of an on-line site describing lake chemistry and biology. The work also has application to understanding the transport of brine in polar settings, which is relevant to nuclear waste repositories. <br/>

At the most fundamental level the interaction of an isolated atom with an intense electromagnetic field is the building block for future advances and thus a major thrust area in modern atomic, molecular and optical physics. At the same time, the interaction of an intense pulse with bulk matter poses more complexity but has far-reaching impact for everyday life, e.g. energy production, medicine and national security. The rapid progress of science and technology in high-energy-density physics has evolved into a symbiotic relationship where new discoveries fuel the need for additional technology and innovative laser concepts open the path to unexpected physical behavior. This project specifically addresses the technology needs for driving these new scientific developments. <br/><br/>The beginning of the 21st century marks the emergence of a novel hybrid laser architecture, optical parametric chirppulse amplification (OPCPA). OPCPA represents a quantum jump in ultra-fast amplifier technology that will have an equivalent scientific impact to that of chirp-pulsed amplification (CPA). This project will develop a unique ultra-fast mid-infrared OPCPA facility operating at 2 micron wavelength at Ohio State University. This represents the first OPCPA university-based program in the US and the first TWOPCPA (TeraWatt Optical Parametric Chirppulse Amplification) system operating at 2 micron. This unique system will open new opportunities in strong-field science that will be enabled by an intense long-wavelength source. <br/><br/>The OPCPA system is designed to have maximum impact on the science interests of a number of faculty at the university while providing cutting edge laser development that extends beyond a specific institutional bound. The proposed 2 micron OPCPA will have a high-average power kilohertz section for addressing important problems in strong-field atomic physics while providing a superior driver for generating high harmonics in the x-ray regime and the production of unprecedented attosecond pulse durations. The kilohertz section will also serve as a preamplifier for a 10 Hz high-powered (10 TeraWatt) OPCPA section for performing investigations in the relativistic regime of intense laser-atom interaction and high-energy-density physics studies in bulk material. Furthermore, the design will allow simultaneous usage of both sections for science application. This facility should allow the university to become a national center of excellence in the development of new technologies for the next generation of ultra-fast studies, as well as the destination school for training in high-energy-density physics and Inertial Confinement Energy. The facility will have a lasting influence on scholarship and teaching traditions within physics at the university. <br/>

Many of these emerging applications are quite data-intensive in nature. Data is being generated from multiple sources such as transactions, instruments, and through simulations. Not only datasets are increasing in size, they are becoming more dynamic and distributed.  The designs used by current-day data-centers have several limitations to achieve good performance and scalability with low cost for handling the emerging trend of dynamic and geographically distributed data. The proposed research is built around computer architecture, networking, cluster computing, and data.<br/><br/>The project will carry out research along the following directions: designing advanced communication protocols and subsystems by taking advantage of novel mechanisms and features of modern networks;  designing and developing novel data-center primitives such as soft shared state, distributed lock managers and global memory aggregators;  designing dynamic content caching services; and designing constraint-based active resource adaptation services to provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees.  Solutions developed along the proposed directions are planned to be integrated on an experimental data-center testbed and a simulated testbed and evaluated using a set of commercial workload.

These nanocomposites which consist of polymers with nanometer-sized particles have exhibited considerable improvements in chemical, thermal, mechanical properties in addition to improved barrier properties. It is all the more fascinating that these improvements occur at a very low loading percentage of nanoparticles. Researchers at Tuskegee University's Center for Advanced Materials have successfully incorporated a variety of nanoparticles with thermosetting and thermoplastic polymers and extended the concept to manufacture structural nanocomposites. Through this approach they have achieved enhancements in strength and stiffness over their neat polymeric composites. In this major research instrumentation proposal, we are seeking to acquire a state-of-the-art ultrasonic C-scan system to assist and enhance the quality of various aspects of the ongoing research projects funded by NSF, ARO, ONR and EPSCoR. A large number of African-American students, both at undergraduate and graduate level with many at Ph.D. level, will be trained in nondestructive characterization of new class of materials, structural nanocomposites. It is only expected that many younger minority students will be encouraged to take up graduate studies when exposed to state-of-the-art facilities like the proposed ultrasonic C-scan system at early stages of their science and engineering education.<br/><br/><br/>Structural nanocomposites have potential to become materials of the future as they have potential to have higher strength and stiffness as compared to current generation fiber reinforced composite materials. Most of the research carried out to date on nanocomposites is focused on the improvement of properties of nanophased matrix systems. In the ongoing research work at Tuskegee University Center for Advanced Materials (T-CAM), attempts are being made to model, synthesize, manufacture and characterize nanophased structural composites. Any such development requires techniques to evaluate elastic properties, defects and damages during manufacture and under different loading conditions using nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. Through this proposal, we are planning to acquire a state-of-the-art ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) system. Using this facility, it is planned to understand the cure kinetics using velocity and attenuation measurements through ultrasonic means, optimize the process of fabrication of structural nanocomposites using VARIM process, quantify fabrication defects, evaluate the elastic properties of new class of nanophased composites through nondestructive means, determine the degradation of nanophased composites when subjected to environmental conditioning, evaluate the progressive growth of damages during fatigue loading, estimate the damage due to low-velocity and ballistic impact loading and evaluate the defects induced during the fabrication of integral skin-stringer assembly by VARIM process and isogrid cylinders by filament winding. We propose to characterize, by means of ultrasonic NDE, different class of nanocomposites that are made using various types of nanoparticles, resin systems and fibers. Finally, through this program, a large number of African-American students, both at undergraduate and graduate level with many at Ph.D level, will be trained in nondestructive characterization of new class of materials: structural nanocomposites.

The first is the decomposition theory of projective modules and pure-projective modules, where realizing and omitting finitely generated positive primitive types one can obtain and classify interesting new examples of projective and pure-projective modules. In the second area, of cotorsion theories, the investigators intend to establish and apply the interplay with the Ziegler spectrum in order to describe the flat cover and the realm of cotorsion modules that are not pure-injective. The third part is about calculation of Ziegler spectra of string algebras as a contribution to representation-theoretic classification and to decidability theory and about the related issue of super-decomposable pure-injectives. As a fourth, more general model-theoretic topic of study, the investigators propose to apply classical model-theoretic constructions to pairs of structures endowed with an epimorphism in order to obtain existence results in `dual' or `projective' model theory (dual in the sense that monomorphisms are replaced by epimorphisms). <br/><br/><br/><br/>The model-theoretic study of mathematical structures is unique in that one restricts to a certain formal language, similar to a computer language. The loss of richness of expression allows for a gain on the side of the structures under investigation: more structures come into play, because the language cannot distinguish between them. (To persue the analogy with computers: a computer may not be able to distinguish between an infinite object and a large finite chunk of it.) The advantage of this approach is that one discovers new structures (models of the formal statements describing the initial structure) that may be very similar to the original structure at hand when the statements mentioned are chosen as to force them to be. It has found striking applications in various parts of mathematics over the last decades. <br/>
0517263	Regulation of Neurogenic Potential in Drosophila Melanogaster	IOS	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY CLUSTER	07/15/2005	07/18/2005	Harald Vaessin	OH	Ohio State University Research Foundation -DO NOT USE	Standard Grant	Steven L. Klein	02/28/2010	$360,000.00		vaessin.1@osu.edu	1960 KENNY RD	Columbus	OH	432101016	6146888734	BIO	7471	9183, BIOT	$0.00	Vaessin #0517263 Abstract <br/><br/>The dorsal thorax of Drosophila is covered with bristles that respond to mechanical stimulation (touch); these sensory organs are part of the adult peripheral nervous system. During third instar larval and early pupal stages, sensory organ precursors (SOPs), each of which gives rise to an individual sensory organ, arise in structures called the imaginal wing discs (larval cells that give rise to the dorsal thorax and the wings of the adult fly). Previous work in Dr. Vaessin's laboratory has shown that the Drosophila gene friend-of-echinoid (fred) has a critical role in limiting the number of SOPs. Remarkably, this requirement for fred gene function is not limited to regions that normally give rise to SOPs, but extends to nearly the entire wing disc.  These results reveal an unexpected potential for neural cell formation in most cells of the imaginal wing disc. The focus of the present proposal is to analyze the structure and function of fred and to identify and characterize genes which act downstream of fred in the regulation of sensory organ precursor formation.<br/>Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent, well-established model system for the genetic analysis of complex developmental problems. The previous work on fred has established a critical and surprising, yet poorly understood role during early formation of neural and epidermal cells.  Thus, the proposed work will provide important new insights into the regulatory network governing neural precursor formation in Drosophila. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Genes that are critical for normal development are highly  conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates.  That is, genes involved in a wide range of processes (for example, body pattern formation, organogenesis, and formation of the nervous system)  play similar developmental roles in many organisms, including flies and mammals.   Therefore, it is expected that the proposed research will also be of direct relevance in understanding similar processes in other organisms. Furthermore, the proposed work provides an important vehicle for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in the molecular genetic analysis of complex developmental problems. In addition, internship opportunities for local High School students will be provided.

The specific objectives are: (1) to measure unary and binary nucleation rates J as a function of supersaturation S and temperature T under conditions that are far from equilibrium, (2) to apply the nucleation theorem to isothermal binary nucleation rates data and determine the composition of critical clusters, and (3) to explore the internal structure of multicomponent nanodroplets as a function of composition using small angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments.  These goals are highly coupled because to measure nucleation rates the number density N of the aerosol formed in the nozzles is determined using SANS.  In the binary case, determining N goes hand in hand with determining the internal structure of the droplets comprising the aerosol.  These data to be generated are important because nucleation rates in nozzles are four to six orders of magnitude higher than other existing experimental techniques.  Combining data from nozzles with other experimental devices yields data sets covering almost 20 orders of magnitude, posing a stringent test for predictive nucleation theories and scaling laws.  Finally, determining the structure of multicomponent droplets with approximately 10 nanometer radii may lead to better models for the behavior of matter in inhomogeneous liquid states.<br/><br/>Multicomponent nanometer-sized droplets form in both natural and industrial environments.  Accurate predictions of the rate at which phase transitions occur and the structure of the final droplets are critical for developing reliable models of industrial processes, climate, and atmospheric chemistry.  The nucleation rate directly affects the aerosol size distribution and thus, the surface area available for heterogeneous chemical reactions. Differences between the surface and the interior, on the other hand, will affect heterogeneous chemistry, the rates of growth and evaporation, and even the rate at which the droplets themselves are formed.<br/>

One is the spectral and asymptotic analyses of  boundary value problems of mathematical physics in non-smooth and singularly perturbed domains as well as their boundary reductions (e.g. to the corresponding boundary integral equations). In particular, explicit asymptotic representations will be derived for solutions of linear and nonlinear boundary value problems under minimal assumptions on the coefficients.<br/><br/>A second topic is the description and analysis of multilevel numerical methods for boundary value problems with singularities. New classes of non-analytic cubature formulas for integral operators with singularities will be derived based on a new approximation method for solving boundary value problems and associated integral equations.<br/><br/>Many problems of elasticity, electromagnetic field theory, acoustics, aero- and hydrodynamics possess solutions with singularities caused by non-smooth coefficients and boundaries, fast oscillations and discontinuities of the data. The goal of this research project is to obtain results that describe the significant properties of the solutions of some problems in mathematical physics - especially their singularities. The techniques to be developed in this project involve issues in, and will contribute to, functional analysis, partial differential equations and numerical analysis. Many of the topics to be investigated should be of interest to students and it is intended to involve a number of students in the project.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>

The prototypical example of such a category is the category of<br/>flat (left) modules over a ring R. The pure-injective objects of the category of<br/>flat R-modules are the flat cotorsion modules. The existence of cotorsion envelopes<br/>in the category of left R-modules is a consequence of the Flat Cover Conjecture<br/>(proved by Bican, El Bashir and Enochs). The project proposes to develop a theory of<br/>flat cotorsion modules that generalizes the classical theory of pure-injective modules<br/>over R.<br/><br/>Ring Theory is the area of Algebra that concentrates on the interaction between possible<br/>notions of multiplication and addition. The representation theory of rings, better known<br/>as Representation Theory, is devoted to the study of modules. These mathematical structures<br/>generalize the concept of a vector space and provide a medium where such instances of<br/>multiplication and addition may manifest themselves. The Model Theory of Modules proposes<br/>to understand modules from the point of view of Mathematical Logic. Thus one is not only<br/>interested in solving linear equations, but also in deciding when a sentence in the <br/>appropriate formal language becomes true when it is assigned a given interpretation.<br/>The modules that arise most naturally from this point of view (and are the subject of<br/>this project) are the pure-injective, or algebraically compact, modules. They also occur<br/>prominently in the classical (non-logical) approach to Representation Theory and so provide<br/>fruitful ground for further interaction between Algebra and Mathematical Logic.<br/><br/><br/>

However, the mammalian fetus is also exposed to another hormone, progesterone, which is produced by the maternal ovaries and the placenta during pregnancy.  The effects of this exposure are unclear at this time, but recent evidence suggests that progesterone may actually masculinize the brain and later impact behavioral responses. <br/>      Marsupial mammals offer a unique opportunity to directly explore the effects of progesterone on fetal development.  Because marsupial mammals are very premature at birth compared to other mammals, much of their early development takes place outside the body of the mother, in an environment that is relatively free of progesterone. Therefore, marsupials are particularly useful for the study of reproductive development.  With this animal model the effects of progesterone can be tightly controlled and directly measured, in the absence of maternal hormonal influences.<br/>      Gray short tailed opossums (Monodelphis domestica), small, gerbil-sized laboratory marsupials, will be used here to characterize the effects of progesterone on the development of masculine and feminine characteristics and behavior in mammals. Opossums will be exposed to different amounts of progesterone soon after birth. When they are adults their behavior will be observed and hormone levels in their blood will be measured. It is expected that early exposure to progesterone will decrease feminine hormonal and behavioral traits in adult animals. <br/>     Progesterone has wide effects on reproductive processes and brain function. It is already known that progesterone maintains pregnancy, activates reproductive and parental behavior and affects learning and memory. The new researchin this project will further extend our understanding of the role of this important hormone as it impacts reproductive development. This project will also provide a wide range of unique  training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students with Dr. Harder at the Ohio State University (OSU) and with Dr. Fadem at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ).  <br/>

This dissertation grant project suggests a stream of research to examine the relationship between the president and the US House of Representatives. Beginning with an analysis of presidential position taking, the research discusses the structure for examining the normal legislative process that accounts for legislative support for the president's program, presidential vetoes, and legislative overrides of those vetoes. The research offers a program that examines the conditions under which presidency- and legislative-centered variables affect presidential position taking, legislative support for the president, and presidential veto/legislative overrides on votes before the US House of Representatives. The project also introduces the concepts of political and regime time as critical variables that both constrain and augment the effects of more traditional president- and legislative-centered predictors of presidential-legislative relations. The intellectual merits of the project are both methodological and theoretical. The research program proposes collecting a large data set-over 3,300 votes in the US House of Representatives-that incorporates each of the possible actions the president and House of Representatives take on votes before the House. The research specifically addresses using the data set to assess the conditions under which presidential position taking, legislative support for those positions, and presidential veto/legislative override actions occur. The research suggests that a carefully collected data set will allow analyses of each discrete stage in the presidential legislative relationship, making possible analysis of nested models of presidential and legislative activity on House votes. The project proposes using cross sectional time series analysis-with probit, logit, or nested logit non-linear, parametric models-to examine the relationship between Congress and the president.<br/>Broader value:   the study can enhance understanding of how presidents influence the behaviors of US House members.<br/>

Efficient techniques for analyzing information from the environment and public health related data, the focus of this proposed work, are crucial to organizations, which make decisions based on large spatial-temporal data sets. The applications of efficient models can be found useful in environment conservation and public health. Traditional data analysis and data mining techniques, which do not model spatial context and temporal effect, may lead to residual errors that vary systematically over space and time. The models derived may turn out to be not only biased and inconsistent, but may also be a poor fit to the data set. The traditional approaches towards solving spatial data analysis are to use classical data analysis tools by using spatial lag or error as one of explanatory variables. These techniques maximize classification accuracy, but spatial accuracy may be of more importance. Temporal and attribute accuracies are ignored in most of these predictive models. In addition, these approaches are often computationally expensive and are confounded with a large datasets.<br/><br/>A new computationally efficient spatial-temporal framework, ST-PUMS (Spatial-temporal<br/>Prediction Using Map Similarity), which maximize map similarity (including spatial similarity, temporal similarity, and attribute similarity) instead of classification/prediction accuracy was proposed. This work addresses how spatial-temporal autocorrelation, the characteristic property of spatial-temporal data, can be incorporated in the ST-PUMS framework. ST-PUMS framework searches the parameter space of models using a new map-similarity measure that is more appropriate in the context of spatial-temporal data. In addition to modeling spatial accuracy, ST-PUMS can also be extended to incorporate temporal and attribute accuracies in the model. ST-PUMS will provide a solution for the difficulties encountered in analyzing spatial-temporal<br/>data. It is able to cope with multidimensional (i.e., spatial, attribute, temporal, etc.) environment and public health related data with complex data structure, and to achieve high efficiency with large volumes of data.<br/><br/>New techniques of the efficient spatial-temporal analysis of environment and public health related data are profound. The proposed framework consists of basic theoretical research as well as rigorous empirical studies to validate all the concepts. The experiments will be driven by a series of increasingly sophisticated case studies, including habitat estimation for bird flu investigation, and asthma hospital admission predictions. The solutions will have a direct impact on several important areas, such as environmental conservation, criminology and justice, real estate management and environmental epidemiology. The concepts, designs, algorithms and strategies are devised to analyze the multiple-dimensional, auto-correlative, large-size spatial-temporal data. The proposed research may also have broad impacts on other natural and social sciences that could take the advantages offered by varieties of spatial-temporal data. <br/>

This project is a fundamental research aimed at investigating the effect of sustained bio-convection in a fluid saturated porous medium (such as soil, food, human tissue) by applying theoretical as well as experimental techniques. Bio-convection is the phenomenon of gravity driven fluid motion due to buoyancy forces resulting from density differences between the fluid and motile micro-organisms suspended in the fluid. So far effects of bio-convection in porous media received little or no attention, despite the fact that micro-organisms grow naturally in porous environments; soil, food and human tissues serve as basic examples. A major focus of our research is linked to the sustainability of the bio-convection motion. The existing work on bio-convection in both pure fluids and porous media exclude micro-organism growth during the bio-convection because the time scales concerned were very short ( between a few seconds and up to 5 minutes). However, when the question of the sustainability of this convection over long times arises, micro-organism growth has to be accounted for. If sustained bio-convection in porous media is possible it opens the avenue to investigate its impact on microbial proliferation in soil, food and human tissue, an important avenue for application of the theoretical results. Then, if bio-convection enhances microbial proliferation it may be undesirable in some cases, e.g. in food, or it might be desirable if specific micro-organisms that can be used for contaminated soil remediation will be helped by the bio-convection process to access contaminated regions in the soil. The research will therefore expand the existing scarce knowledge on bio-convection in porous media. The anticipated outcomes from this research are publications in journals and conferences hence disseminating the scientific results, a strong international collaboration with two teams from South Africa, and about six undergraduate students from Northern Arizona University who will be heavily involved in the project. <br/><br/><br/><br/>

It has been seen that the theory of hypergraphs is a powerful tool for the solution of integers optimization problems, such as scheduling problems, location <br/>problems, etc. when the incidence matrices of the corresponding graphs have some special properties. Combinatorial block designs, whose root can be traced much earlier than hypergraphs, are considered as special hypergraphs. They already found applications such as experiment designs, coding theory, etc. In this project, the investigator intends to extend the hypergraph and combinatorial design theories, motivated <br/>by a new class of applications, namely powerful interconnection structures in high-performance computing and communications based on multiconnect components. The new class of interconnection structures <br/>considered are called hypernetworks. A typical multiconnect component is an optical device connecting a set of nodes using TDM, WDM, CDM and SDM techniques. Additional examples of multiconnect component include a <br/>wireless LAN, a cluster of communicating mobile stations and a high-performance subnetwork in grid computing. A hypernetwork is represented by a hypergraph. In a point-to-point network, each connection, which connects a pair of nodes, has a fixed capacity dedicated to it. In a hypernetwork, the nodes connected by a <br/>multiconnect component or multipoint subnet are considered fully connected. Due to shared resources (channels, transceivers. etc.), hypernetworks have more balanced link loading, higher throughput and <br/>reduced time delay. Furthermore, hypernetworks support multipoint communications more efficiently. A hypernetwork, when abstracted as a hypergraph, is characterized by several parameters, such as vertex <br/>degree, hyperedge rank, diameter, bisection connectivity. regularity, uniformity, symmetry, etc. Since combinatorial block designs are special hypergraphs with many properties that are desirable in <br/>hypernetworks, it is quite natural to consider hypernetworks whose underlying theoretic models are block designs. The investigator propose to use hypergraph and combinatorial block design theories to guide the <br/>design of hypernetworks. Each design aspect has a spectrum of design choices. The design of a particular type of hypernetworks depend in application demands, technology feasibility, and cost-effectiveness. <br/>Since desirable hypernetwork features are interrelated and many of them have contradicting requirements, trade-offs must be considered. Thus, hypernetwork design problems are constrained optimization problems. The goal of this project is to investigate the potential and limit of hypernetworks by applying new combinatorial optimization techniques.<br/>The proposed research have implications in the construction of new computing and communication systems using emerging technologies. The proposed work is theoretical in nature, and it addresses fundamental issues in information processing and communication.  <br/>

The aim is to develop theoretic understanding and<br/>derive numerical algorithms for the quadratic model reconstruction<br/>so that the inexactness and uncertainty inherent in the model due<br/>to the limitation of current technologies are reduced while certain<br/>specific mathematical conditions are satisfied. The most difficult<br/>task in the quadratic model reconstruction is to satisfy the associated<br/>constraints which could be inherited intrinsically from the physical<br/>feasibility of a certain mechanical structure or could be driven<br/>extrinsically by the desirable property of a certain design parameter.<br/>The greatest challenge, which is also an imperative requirement in<br/>practice, is that the reconstruction must be carried out using only<br/>partial eigeninformation which are available by the state-of-the-art<br/>computational techniques. The inverse problem of constrained model<br/>reconstruction is essential for the understanding and management of<br/>complex systems, yet many questions on the solvability, sensitivity,<br/>and computation remain unanswered.  The investigators have made<br/>significant contributions to the quadratic model construction problems<br/>individually and now intend to extend their investigation and join<br/>expertise to these challenging inverse problems. This proposed work<br/>therefore should be of compelling independent interest within both<br/>the engineering and mathematical sciences communities.<br/><br/>In mathematical modelling, techniques of inverse problems that validate,<br/>determine, or estimate the parameters of the system according to its<br/>observed or expected behavior are critically important. This research<br/>concentrates on the inverse model reconstruction problems with their<br/>pertinence to physical and engineering applications. These problems have<br/>been strongly motivitated  by scietific and industrial applications,<br/>including structural mechanics such as vibration control and stability<br/>analysis of bridges, buildings and highways, vibro-acoustics such as<br/>predictive coding of sound, biomedical signal and image processing,<br/>time series forecasting, information technology, and others. Thus this<br/>project will impact a wide variety of industries utilizing these<br/>applications, including aerospace, automobile, manufacturing and<br/>biomedical engineering. The greatest challenge facing these industries<br/>is to manufacture increasingly improved products with limited engineering<br/>and computing resources. A great deal of money and efforts have been spent<br/>in these industries to satisactorily perform the model updating task.<br/>However, the lack of proper theory and computational tools often force<br/>these industries to solve their problems in an ad hoc fashion. An improved<br/>analytical model that can be used with confidence for future designs is<br/>an essential tool in achieving this obejective. The propsed research has<br/>not only strong mathematical foundation but also significant matematical<br/>modelling and experimental aspects using idustrial data which should be<br/>instantly welcome by the industries. Furthermore, the students working<br/>on this project for four years will receive a valuable interdisciplnary<br/>training blending mathematics and scietific computing with various areas<br/>of engineering and applied sciences.

Fisher's linear classifier which maximizes the separation between the groups in the spirit of analysis of variance requires multivariate normality for each group with a common covariance matrix.  For heterogeneous covariance matrices, the optimal classifier is no longer linear and has poor performance for small samples.  Though there are many heuristic and ad hoc methods to handle the case of unequal covariances, model-based approaches using mixtures of multivariate normal distributions and the spectral decomposition of the covariance matrices have shown great promise for the traditional multivariate data.  The goal of this research is to develop new and flexible classification methods for longitudinal, functional and multivariate time series data using the Cholesky decomposition of covariance matrices instead of their spectral decompositions.  For such data, the Cholesky decomposition is more suitable and its components enjoy both statistical interpretation as certain regression coefficients and geometric interpretation in terms of volumes, shapes and orientations of ellipsoids representing various groups in the data. It is proposed to study the computational, statistical and empirical aspects of using the Cholesky decomposition and compare the results with those obtained using the spectral decomposition.  The methods and tools to be employed include:  generalized linear and mixed models, factor analysis, time series analysis, maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation of mixture models in the presence of missing values, cross-validation and bootstrap.<br/> The proposed research will extend classical discriminant analysis to longitudinal and functional data.  It is of great practical interest and will provide insight into when a particular classification method can be expected to work well, and may lead to the development of new classification criteria and methods for discriminating between nuclear explosions and earthquakes.  A problem which is of critical importance for monitoring a comprehensive test-ban treaty.  The broader impact of the proposed work can be seen in settings where high-dimensional and large amounts of multivariate data are collected, such as clinical trials, biotechnology, environmental monitoring and global change, epidemiology and financial econometrics.<br/>

However, many areas of paleoecological inquiry, particularly those relying on data collected at discrete points, such as pollen and charcoal studies, emphasize temporal variability and minimize or neglect the spatial dimension.  This is particularly true of fire history research that is based on fire-scar data collected from individual trees.  Many such studies result in a fire return interval that estimates how frequently a portion of the landscape burned.  These fire-return intervals are spatially ambiguous and sensitive to the extent of the area for which they are calculated, making interpretation challenging.  Furthermore, past studies that have addressed spatial variability have used discrete representations of fires, principally mapped outlines of the estimated fire extent.  This format is difficult to evaluate because presents spatial and temporal variability separately, and it precludes independent interpretation.  The purpose of this Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement project is to develop an integrated spatial-temporal representation system for paleo-fire.  The project will incorporate fire-history science, landscape ecology, and geographic information science, particularly space-time and spatial cognition theory.  The doctoral candidate will use georeferenced fire-scarred tree data in a geographic information system.  The representation will integrate field and object models of past fires and incorporate an iconic visualization language that will illustrate the change in state of individual trees in space and through time.  This system will facilitate novel approaches to analyzing paleo-fire.  A spatially explicit approach for estimating fire return interval will be presented.  Spatial metrics extracted from the representation system will be used to evaluate the influence of top-down climatic factors and bottom-up topographic factors on spatial-temporal variability of past fires.<br/><br/>Current explosive wildfires can only be understood within their historical ecological context.  This project will improve basic understanding of natural wildfire regimes by contributing new analytical methods and a cognitively sensitive approach to data representation.  These new approaches to data representation, including maps of paleoecological fires, will be accessible to a wide range of interested parties, including scientists, managers, and concerned members of the public.  This will improve the understanding of paleo-fire and present educational opportunities using complex paleoecological data.  Finally, this project can benefit other types of paleoecological research where deep time point data are used.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>
0444598	Transport and Biochemical Events Associated With Metabolic Regulation of the Squid Nerve Na+/Ca2+ Exchanger	MCB	FUNCTIONAL & REGULATORY SYS CL	08/01/2005	07/25/2005	Luis Beauge	MA	Marine Biological Laboratory	Standard Grant	Richard Rodewald	07/31/2010	$195,000.00		lbeauge@immf.uncor.edu	7 M B L ST	WOODS HOLE	MA	025431015	5082897243	BIO	7473	1114, 1136, 7473, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	The Sodium/Calcium counter-transport is a ubiquitous structure that reversibly exchanges Sodium for Calcium across cell membranes. This system is conspicuously regulated by intracellular ions and metabolism. Among ions, Sodium and Protons are inhibitory while Calcium stimulates. Regarding metabolism, ATP antagonizes ionic inhibition while, in squid nerve, phosphoarginine (PA) stimulates by promoting the binding of Calcium to its transporting sites. Stimulation by ATP requires a low molecular weight Soluble Cytosolic Regulatory Protein (SCRP); stimulation by PA seems related to another membrane bound protein known as Small Neurofilament. Ionic and ATP regulations take place on a large intracellular region of the exchanger protein. In contrast, PA modulation is likely to occur in other yet unspecified place/s. The experimental evidence indicates that the chemical reactions related to ATP and PA modulations are different. However, the investigators recently found that ATP protects against the inhibition in PA modulation following cellular acidification (increase in Proton concentration); this may represent a link between the two modulators paths. This project will individualize and characterize the interrelationships between ionic and metabolic regulation of the squid Sodium/Calcium exchanger by using three experimental preparations: (i) squid axons under internal dialysis, essentially an in vivo preparation that permits complete ionic and biochemical control of intra- and extra cellular environments; (ii) squid nerve membrane vesicles, an excellent model to perform parallel transport and biochemical assays and protein isolation; and (iii) squid axoplasm, as a source for proteins isolation. Specifically the research aims to: (i) establish if ATP protection against proton inhibition of PA modulation takes place via the path for ATP regulation or is an independent ATP effect; (ii) identify and functionally characterize the SCRP required for ATP regulation; and (iii) identify and characterize the structures related to PA stimulation. Regarding the broader impact of the project it must be emphasized that it provides an excellent opportunity for training and education of young scientists and fostering of cooperation between American and Latin American scientists.

To improve our ability to predict the dynamics of carbon in high latitudes, this team analyze comprehensively the carbon cycle of the arctic system, guided by the following general questions: What are the geographic patterns of fluxes of CO2 and CH4 over the Pan-Arctic region and how is the balance changing over time and What processes control the sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4 over the Pan-Arctic region and how do the controls change with time?<br/><br/>To address these general questions, the group will integrate data on CO2 and CH4 dynamics of the Arctic System using a combination of prognostic and inverse approaches and provide an integrative approach to estimating and understanding the exchanges of CO2 and CH4 from terrestrial and marine components of the system.<br/><br/>Because the climate system is vulnerable to significant releases of CO2 and CH4 from high latitudes, the responses of these gases to climate change have global consequences. This study will bring together diverse regional data sets and understanding in the context of a linked set of numerical model studies. It will examine, and attempt to quantify, the fluxes and links between the terrestrial, atmospheric and oceanic components of the Arctic carbon and methane cycles. <br/><br/>

These pressures have revealed several limitations of the Internet architecture, and the Internet's increasing ubiquity and importance have made these flaws all the more evident and urgent. However, it is far easier to complain about the Internet architecture than it is to produce a better design. This proposal accepts that challenge, by proposing a clean-sheet redesign of the Internet. The proposed design is based on a new naming system that names services (or data) and endpoints (hosts) separately from network locations, and incorporates notions of delegation and indirection. Moreover, these service and endpoint identifiers are flat, with no hierarchical structure.<br/><br/>Such architecture naturally handles host mobility, multihoming, and data replication and migration, and incorporates middleboxes in an architecturally clean manner. In addition, it simplifies interdomain routing, by adopting a new global addressing structure that makes explicit the administrative domain to which a host belongs. The interdomain routing protocol exchanges routes based on these flat domain identifiers (instead of today's IP prefixes that cause many problems), together with flexible mappings of flat end-host identifiers, to enable more flexible routing policies for ISPs and hosts.<br/>

The federated content distribution infrastructure will: i) simultaneously meet the performance demands of high-bandwidth and low-latency content delivery and the resource allocation constraints of constituent service providers; ii) weather a variety of attacks both from the outside and from self-interested or malicious nodes directly participating in the protocol; iii) incorporate basic algorithms for distributing content under a wide variety of dynamic network conditions.  Because the infrastructure is shared by a variety of applications and hosted by a number of mutually distrustful administrative domains, the system must provide mechanisms that both adjudicate among competing applications and allow each administrative domain to maintain its own resource allocation policies.<br/><br/>If successful this research will effect a qualitative shift in: i) the way in which data is distributed across the Internet; ii) basic algorithms for determining optimal data distribution strategies across arbitrary data meshes; iii) the levels of reliability<br/>and performance that can be achieved in critical nation-wide or global-scale event notification systems (e.g., the air-traffic control system); and iv) the ability of resource-poor providers to harness federated distribution utilities to publish urgent content such as Internet worm or virus signatures on a global scale.<br/>

This is true in the case of Ixil, a Mayan language spoken by entire communities only in the highlands of northern Guatemala.  The remaining approximately 65,000 speakers of Ixil are the survivors of a genocidal attack upon the Ixil people that took place in the 1980s during the Guatemalan civil war. This project will serve to document not only the Ixil language but also the important social context of  the survival of the Ixil people.  The product of this documentation project will be a web-based, multimedia database of Ixil conversations, narratives, and oral histories containing text versions of the narratives along with voice and video files.  Different programming features will render the database accessible in several formats including: 1) a technical version containing morphological and syntactic analysis of the texts intended for linguists, anthropologists, historians and others interested in the scholarly examination of the Ixil language; 2)  a version intended for native speakers, teachers, and learners of Ixil, useful as the basis for curriculum for the Ixil communities' literacy and history classes for children and adults; and 3) a dictionary of the words used in the narratives.  A research team consisting of Dr. Jule Gomez de Garcia, Dr. Melissa Axelrod, and graduate student Maria Luz Garcia will gather the narratives in Nebaj, El Quiche, Guatemala, and surrounding communities.  Members of an Ixil women's cooperative will assist in the transcription and analysis of the narrative and conversational materials.    <br/><br/>In addition to providing documentation for the Ixil community, this product will increase understanding of the conversation and discourse structures of Ixil and provide a rich database for students of Mayan languages and cultures in general.  This information will also contribute to aspects of linguistic theory dealing with an understanding of the range and parameters of linguistic structures and behaviors as they reflect human cognitive functions. The practical benefits from this research are the inclusion of university students and members of indigenous communities in the development and practice of methodologies for documenting endangered languages.<br/>

The program integrates research, training, and educational activities among complementary faculty in ecology, evolution and environment, infectious disease, and social science, ethics, law and economics. The goal of the program is to train a new generation of Ph.D. scientists capable of designing and implementing sound scientific solutions to environmental problems within the framework of human culture, economics, policy, and law.  Human practices and activities affecting environmental and global health have interrelated causes and feedbacks.  These feedbacks are both biological and social, and exacerbate environmental degradation and the spread of invasive species and disease.  Consequently, solutions to increasingly linked environmental and health problems require the coordinated interaction of biological and social scientists with expertise in ecology, evolution, infectious disease, anthropology, ethics, law, policy, and economics.  The intellectual merit of this IGERT consists of the integration of the research and education activities of  life and social scientists at the University of Notre Dame in a concerted effort to understand and find solutions to five specific problems: (1) invasive species in the Great Lake and their cascading effects on ecosystems (2) interactions of human land-use change and malaria transmission in West Africa; (3) cross-primate exchange of disease on the island of Bali, (4) resurgence of schistosomiasis in China driven by changes in water- and land-use patterns, and (5) impacts of invasive Sudden Oak Death as it spreads across the U.S.  Without interdisciplinary thinking, relatively simple and effective measures to reduce environmental damage and disease transmission can go unrecognized. Most analyses suffer from concentrating on only one aspect of the question (e.g., ecology, culture, or disease).  This IGERT will foster cross-disciplinary conversation and guide research directed at developing prevention and control responses to invasive species and disease that are scientifically sound, culturally acceptable, and cost-effective. The IGERT will use a coordinated set of approaches ranging from team-based research projects to outreach service activities to provide students with the interdisciplinary skills and knowledge they need to tackle the increasingly complex environmental and global health problems of our nation and the planet.  The broader impacts of this proposal include finding solutions to these environmental and health problems.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.
0528060	High Strain Rate Testing and Modeling of Elastomers	CMMI	STRUCTURAL MATERIALS AND MECH	09/01/2005	06/01/2006	Michelle Hoo Fatt	OH	University of Akron	Standard Grant	lawrence bank	12/31/2007	$205,000.00		hoofatt@uakron.edu	302 Buchtel Common	Akron	OH	443250001	3309727666	ENG	1635	025E, 026E, 1057, 9102, 9251, CVIS	$0.00	Abstract<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this research project is to develop constitutive equations and failure criteria for elastomers under high rates of loading.  Elastomers are used to mitigate structural damage caused by impulsive or impact loads because of their low modulus, high damping and large extensibility.  Rubber isolation bearings, shock pads and shock absorbers are common examples where elastomers protect structures from impulsive forces, but polyurea coatings for building walls, polyester films in glass windows, and advanced polymeric coatings for ship hulls and army vehicles are more recent examples where elastomers save human lives from bomb blasts.  The mechanical behavior of the above-mentioned elastomeric structures is dominated by large strain, high strain rate and nonlinear viscoelastic/viscoplastic material response.  Yet testing and modeling of elastomers have been confined mostly to quasi-static deformation, creep, relaxation, and small strain, linear viscoelastic vibration response.  No one to date has been able to address the underlying physics behind the high strain rate behavior of elastomers.  The intellectual merit of the proposed research is that it offers pioneering contributions in the areas of high speed testing and material modeling of elastomers.  Specific objectives of this research are to develop an experimental program that would characterize extensive deformation and fracture of elastomers at impact rates; derive physically-based hyper-viscoelastic constitutive equations; and obtain dynamic failure criteria to predict rupture of polymeric structures.  Through a series of tensile impact tests, the PI will elucidate some of the high strain rate phenomena, which cause these materials to be their toughest and strongest at critical values of strain rate.  The PI has developed a tensile impact experiment to obtain high strain rate tensile properties of rubber and polyurea under prior NSF funding.  This work will be extended by using high speed video photography to obtain more comprehensive deformation and fracture properties of the elastomer.  A parametric study on the crosslink density of the polyurea/polyurethane as well as the type and content of carbon fillers in rubbers will allow the PI to develop micro mechanism-driven constitutive laws for these elastomers.  These rate-dependent constitutive models are much needed in the design and analysis of elastomeric structures under shock and impact.  Thus, the broader impact of this research is in prevention of human injuries and fatalities under impulsive, blast or impact loading.  The PI is collaborating with Tyndall Air Force Research Laboratory, where walls are retrofitted with elastomers for blast protection; the Pacific Earthquake Research Center at Berkeley, and Bridgestone/Firestone North American Tires in Akron.  These agencies will provide technical consultation and materials, and collaboration with them will allow for effective dissemination of results to the scientific community.  The PI will also incorporate some of the experimental program into two senior-level design courses at The University of Akron and apply for additional NSF funding to support more undergraduate students, particularly those from under-represented groups.  Students working under this grant will obtain valuable hands-on laboratory experience, academic credit for their work, and a modest stipend for their efforts.   The experiments will also become part of a spotlight event used to encourage high school seniors to enroll in engineering.  <br/>

There are 4 PIs across three departments, possessing expertise in polymer processing and development, materials characterization of structure-property relationships, and mechanical behavior of polymers.  The presently unavailable nanoindentation system can (1) enhance NSF-funded cost-effective alternative nanomaterials for functional polymer nanocomposites.  The research aims to develop a novel alternative technology and formulates a distinct and cost-effective breed of functional nanoscale reinforcements, viz., nanoscale graphite platelets (NGP). The NGP can be made available at low cost and surface modified using UV/O3 for different composite applications.  Nanomechanical characterization will produce fruitful information in localized viscoelastic deformation, multiphase morphology and interfacial properties, all of which play important roles in influencing the functional performance of the composites.  The indentation system can also (2) benefit research on developing cement-polymer composites reinforced by nanocrystallites, referred to as polymer-intercalated/exfoliated cement (PIEC), which provides an order of magnitude higher in enhancement in strength, adhesion, workability, durability and cost-reduction than conventional infrastructure materials.  The instrumentation can quantify the interfacial parameters that govern the composite's property enhancements.  (3) Understanding of multi-scale structure development in polymer processing by chaotic mixing can be augmented via nanoindentation techniques.  Nanoindentation can perform toughness assessment that could not be otherwise obtained using existing instrumentation for the layered silicate nanocomposites processed via chaotic mixing.  (4) The state-of-the-art self-arrangement nanolithography method developed at Akron, which involves the use of mechanical film-stretching with the incorporation of block copolymerization methods prior to excimer laser irradiation, can be enhanced.  The instrument can provide quantitative measurements of the polymeric domains derived from self-arranged nanolithography.  The Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Akron is over 86 years old and poised to develop novel educational programs in the new century.  The Department offers one of a kind ABET-accredited (2002) Bachelor of Science in Mechanical-Polymer Engineering (BSMPE) program in our nation.  The unique program produces qualified engineering students equipped for the challenges in engineering practice for the regional industry and federal laboratories.  The instrument will be integrated with the laboratory experience for the BSMPE students.  The Department also boasts one of the oldest (1914) and most dynamic engineering co-op programs in our nation, with strong support from our neighboring industrial partners in Ohio. <br/><br/> The up-to-date knowledge acquired by our undergraduate students in senior design and co-op projects can greatly strengthen our nation's industrial hub.  The University has established the Akron Global Polymer Academy to disseminate new technologies to companies.  It also helps small US companies to upgrade their operations by providing the technology and human resources.  Presently, Ohio is undergoing a pressing technological transition.  The project can benefit our industrial partners and provide sustainable industrialization and science education in the state through cultivating a science-intensive infrastructure in the northeastern Ohio region.  <br/>

The fundamental research questions underlying these projects are often implied or stated in highly detailed, technical terms.  It will be a significant challenge to think beyond these sub-disciplines and identify a short list of big questions driving the field as a whole.  The present study by the National Research Council would seek to overcome this challenge by careful choice of a committee of experts in the solid Earth science and related disciplines.  Committee members will be well-respected individuals who have a reputation of thinking broadly and beyond their individual specialties.  Some will be members of the National Academy of Sciences.  Others will be young scientists (including members of under-represented groups) with new ideas on how the field should evolve.  A science writer will be included to ensure that the results are understandable to scientists outside of the field as well as to the interested public. This activity is aimed at communicating the excitement of basic research in the solid-Earth sciences to non-specialists, including members of Congress and the general public. The research questions driving the field are broad, and require a strong program of basic research to be answered.  If the questions can be stated in an inspiring way and with a minimum of jargon, they may help attract students to the field and/or assist agency managers to describe and promote their Earth-science programs to Congress, the administration, and the public.   This action, combined with wide print and electronic dissemination of the NRC report, could ultimately lead to increased visibility of the field.

A much larger proportion of this landscape is also scarred by<br/>drained thaw-lake basins, which become sites for the accumulation of organic carbon as<br/>peat deposits. For this interdisciplinary study of thaw lakes and thaw-lake<br/>basins, the Principal Investigators will interview Inupiat Elders from the villages of Barrow and Atqasuk. The objective is to obtain first-hand accounts of lake drainage events, locate these basins, and, using these oral traditions, establish the date of lake drainage occurrence well before the earliest air photographs. This project is intellectually meritorious in that the results will add significantly to our understanding of the basic processes responsible for these important elements of the northern Alaskan landscape. Broader impacts include accessing traditional knowledge of local Elders in Barrow and Atqasuk, who have primary and secondary information on recent lake drainage and flooding events. This project fulfills SGER criteria of having a severe urgency with regard to availability of, or access to data, in that the Elders of the North Slope possess unique ecological and scientific knowledge which is disappearing rapidly.<br/>

It is important for students to understand plate tectonics because 1) it influences how non-science majors view processes that shape the world in which they live; and 2) it lays the foundation for geology majors to continue their study of the Earth.  Pictorial models from textbooks are generally used to teach plate tectonics because the processes embodied therein are largely abstract and cannot be directly observed in their entirety.  Yet, constructivists argue that models should be built rather than described.  This project addresses two issues that arise when teaching plate tectonics: 1) students do not have experience building or understanding models; and 2) students bring naive preconceptions to the classroom that interfere with their science learning.  <br/>In this project, student preconceptions related to the Earth are systematically addressed as students work in groups to create physical models that simulate various aspects of Earth structure, seafloor spreading, plate-boundary interactions, earthquakes, and magma viscosity.  As students compare, contrast, and revise their simple physical models, they are being be taught how to create advanced mental models of the processes involved in plate tectonics.  This approach has been used to address science preconceptions that hinder learning of chemistry, physics and biology.  It is being studied here to see if physical model building facilitates learning of the content, relationships, and processes of plate tectonics.  This project is also determining the extent to which physical model building overcomes preconceptions and promotes development of appropriate advanced mental models in students.  The learning process is being evaluated formatively (during model building) and summatively (after model building) using concept map development, responses to conceptual questions, interviews, and through student self-assessment and reflections on their model building activities. These evaluations are expected to expand the database of known preconceptions that hinder learning of plate tectonics, to determine the efficacy of having students construct physical models in large classroom settings, and to document those modeling activities that facilitate learning of plate tectonics. <br/>

The Technical University Berlin is developing a life cycle unit, which used life cycle data to design a life cycle board, which integrates sensors and data processing to actuate remedial actions to prevent failure.  The condition based maintenance approach requires both power and significant computing capability.  The life cycle unit approach is more equipment specific and the computing is encapsulated along with the sensor generally requiring only low power.

After ingestion and binding to specific sites on the midgut epithelium, the toxins insert into the lipid bilayer to create pores, which eventually lyse the epithelial cells and kill the insect. Although Bt toxins have received a great deal of study because of their potential use in biological control of agricultural pests, much less is known about their binding targets in the insect membrane, or the molecular interactions leading to pore formation and death. The noctuid moth Heliothis virescens is typically highly susceptible to the Bt toxin Cry1Ac, but the laboratory selected YHD2 strain is up to 10,000-fold resistant. These investigators have previously shown that most of this resistance is due to a knockout of a cadherin-like protein, HevCaLP, by insertion of a transposable element fragment into the coding sequence of the gene. They have also identied two additional resistance genes that are unlinked to the HevCaLP gene. This project will characterize the interactions of all three genes by rigorously determining the relationship between genotypes and resistance phenotypes. Methods to be employed include construction and analysis of three-generation pedigrees based on crosses between resistant and susceptible strains; linkage map construction with AFLPs; QTL analysis; growth inhibition and mortality bioassays; and (with collaborators) measurement of toxin binding phenotypes of larval midgut membranes. This project will be the first to characterize the interaction between different genes conferring insect resistance to a bacterial toxin, and will provide important tools for future determination of the molecular identity of the  newly-discovered genes.<br/><br/>This project will contribute molecular and genetic tools that can be applied to ensure the continued sustainability of safe and effective control of insect pests by Bt transgenic crops, with a reduction of chemical insecticide use in US agroecosystems. Undergraduates from Clemson University and minority institutions in South Carolina will participate in the research.  Results from this project will be featured in the activities of the South Carolina DNA Learning Center, recently established to provide outreach education in biotechnology and modern genetics to K-12 teachers, non-formal educators, students, and the general public.

The work also will develop models to predict filtration efficiency, pressure drop, and capacity of the nano-agglomerate filter medium. Nanoparticles in the dry state have been found to consist of porous agglomerates with a hierarchical fractal structure and a high porosity (> 0.99). This structure results in a multi-modal pore size distribution within the agglomerates, which is very different from the unimodal pore-size distribution found in widely used fiber-based HEPA filters. Preliminary evidence has shown that such nano-agglomerate filters act as a depth filters and thus have significantly greater capacity (up to two orders of magnitude) than traditional fiber-based HEPA filters. HEPA filters are widely used in many industrial processes and even in homes, and if successful, this work could have significant economic benefits.<br/><br/>

Algae require both nutrients and light to sustain growth, and storm events affect the amounts of nutrients and light that are available to algae.  Rain storms wash nutrients into lakes and redistribute nutrients within the lake.  Wind storms also redistribute nutrients and cause algae to be exposed to different levels of light.  Initial results of this research indicate that significant enhancement of PP from these physical forcing events may be unaccounted for in our current estimates of aquatic production.  Specifically, this research will increase current understanding of aquatic ecosystems by combining observational studies, experimentation, and modeling.  Algal primary production and water chemistry will be measured before, during, and after storm events.  Experiments will be performed to determine the impacts of mixing on light and nutrients as they relate to algal growth.  The results from these measurements and experiments will be used to construct a mathematical model to predict algal primary production.  The new knowledge derived from this research effort will improve our understanding of the effects of storm events on lakes, and our ability to predict ecological responses to climate change.  The broader impacts of the proposed research include training a Ph.D. student and improving the ability of scientists to predict how disturbance or changes in climate will impact aquatic ecosystems in the future.

High resolution x-ray diffraction measurements will be applied to determine the lattice parameters of the film components and the substrates.  In parallel, the local structure and valence about the transition metal atoms and the oxygen atoms will be determine.  In addition to bulk magnetization measurements, detailed magnetic imaging of the surface will be conducted by photoexcitation electron emission microscopy (PEEM) measurements. Patterned films will be examined to explore geometrical effect.  The film results will be compared with parallel magnetization and high pressure transport and structural measurements on the corresponding bulk samples.  In this way, we will be able to separate extrinsic effects from intrinsic effect as well to explore changes at the surface of manganites in comparison with bulk samples. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in all levels of this work including sample preparation, laboratory and synchrotron based measurements, modeling and data analysis.  A seven week summer research and teaching program on transition metal oxide preparation and characterization, designed for Newark area high school students will be continued and expanded to include a two-week workshop for high school teachers to enable them to implement components of the program into their laboratory experiments.  <br/><br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract<br/>    Manganite oxides exhibit significant changes in electrical conductivity in response to pressure, magnetic fields, light, and electrical fields. As a result of this sensitivity, these materials show much promise for the development of new magnetic sensors and non-volatile data storage.  However, much basic research is needed in order to truly understand the origin of the response to external stimuli and to optimizer them for applications.  Understanding phase coexistence is a central part of the required basic research.  This project will measure the magnetic, electronic and structural properties of manganite films on multiple length scales under strain and under pressure to fully characterize the response to external perturbations.  Synchrotron based x-ray methods will be used to determine the structure, valence  and magnetic properties.  The results will lead to more detailed models of these materials, and possibly, methods for optimizing them in applications.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in all levels of this work including sample preparation, laboratory and synchrotron based measurements, modeling and data analysis.  A seven week summer research and teaching program on transition metal oxide preparation and characterization, designed for Newark area high school students will be continued and expanded to include a two-week workshop for high school teachers to enable them to implement components of the program into their laboratory experiments.  The program will be integrated into high school science laboratory courses. This will serve to (1) develop scientific literacy and to directly influence students to pursue careers in science, and (2) provide exposure to experimental techniques and methods to high school teachers and high school students and to others who do not have access to modern research facilities.<br/>

Mixed polymer brushes refer to monolayers of two unlikely polymers grafted to the same solid substrate. The mixed brushes grafted onto a plane of solid substrates were successfully used by the PIs to design smart and responsive surfaces which change the surface composition, interfacial energy, adhesion, adsorption, wetting behavior, etc upon external signals (solvent, pH, temperature). The mechanism of the switching/responsive behavior was shown to originate from the microphase segregation of unlikely polymers where outside conditions may strongly affect the phase segregation.  In this proposal, we suggest the translation of the developed approaches into a new challenging system - spherical mixed brushes. Two unlikely polymers will be end-grafted to the same spherical nanoparticle. The spherical geometry brings new aspects to the phase segregation of the mixed brushes. Upon external stimuli, the phase separation in the spherical mixed brushes results in several characteristic morphologies: core-shell, inverse core-shell (polymers are segregated in the radial direction) and Janus-like morphology (two unlikely polymers occupy different sides of the particles). The mechanism is strongly affected by the ratio between the nanoparticles' radius and brush thickness. This new aspect will allow us to add a new parameter (particle radius) for the regulation of the response. This research will focus on the systematic study of the phase segregation mechanism in the spherical brushes in a controlled outside environment. The regulated response of the brushes will be used to regulate self-assembly of the smart particles in colloidal systems (colloidal solutions and suspensions). Formation of supra micelles upon external signal is the second target of the project. Two collaborating teams from Clarkson University and Clemson University will concentrate their expertise on the synthesis and study of the hierarchical self-assembly of spherical mixed brushes.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>The smart nanoparticles will allow for the modification of bulk properties as well as the<br/>modification of surface properties of materials. Development of this approach will be<br/>important to transform recent advances in nanoscience to industrial technologies with broad<br/>applications from nanocomposites to drug delivery systems. Another priority of the proposed<br/>project is the involvement of the brightest high school, undergraduate and graduate students in the modern surface and nanotechnology research. The project will result in the training of the students in the area of surface modification and characterization of nanostructured systems.  Students will also greatly benefit from the collaboration between Clemson and Clarkson Universities. Moreover, they will be actively involved in the international research collaboration that is also planned in this project. Significant effort will be directed to increase<br/>the numbers of students, especially minorities and women, who pursue advanced degrees in science and engineering.<br/><br/>

Improvements include a new, innovative scanner with a closed-loop control of the z-axis, providing precise control of tip-sample separation over a 20 microns range of motion. Additionally a low noise AFM head with low coherence length light source will be included which eliminates periodic noise (interference effects) and achieves true thermally limited pico-Newton scale performance. The upgrade will provide the quantitative force measurement capabilities necessary to perform experiments encompassing several multidisciplinary projects. Specifically, the instrument will be used to study the light induced magnetism in nanostructured materials, the influence of charge on adhesion, the process of charge transfer between materials, and the mechanical properties and interactions of fungi. In addition to the use in our research programs, an updated instrument will provide added opportunities in undergraduate and graduate education. The educational use of this instrument will occur in laboratory instruction (as a part of undergraduate curriculum) as well as through its use in undergraduate and graduate research projects in all the above-mentioned research areas. Additionally, this equipment will expand the opportunities for undergraduate students and high school teachers participating in Towson University's NSF REU/RET program.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) has been successfully used in industrial, government and academic research for over two decades.  These microscopes have rejuvenated the area of nanotechnology, providing scientists with the ability to see and manipulate nanometer - size objects. While best known for its ability to provide extremely detailed, three dimensional images of surface features, it is also capable of quantitatively measuring forces between objects. Within the last 10 years, commercially available AFMs have increased in sophistication and capabilities as new technologies have become available. This proposal seeks to upgrade an existing Nanoscope III Atomic Force Microscope to incorporate new technological capabilities. This improvement will provide the ability to study novel methods for data storage and gain fundamental knowledge of how charge affects adhesion in micron-size particles.

Yellen	07/31/2008	$68,049.00		quilter@fas.harvard.edu	1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE	Cambridge	MA	021385369	6174955501	SBE	1391	0000, 9178, OTHR, SMET	$0.00	With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Jeffrey Quilter and an international team of colleagues will conduct a pilot project of archaeological and documentary research on the north coast of Peru at the ruins of an early Colonial Period (ca. 1560 - 1820) church and town, Santa Magdalena de Cao Viejo. The project combines U.S. and Peruvian specialists in field archaeology, advanced mapping techniques, documentary analysis, and other specialties to examine theories on social, economic, political, and other processes resulting from the imposition of a foreign regime, the Spanish, on native peoples.<br/><br/>The encounter of Europeans and Native Americans is one of the great epics of world history. While the events that took place are condemned as tragic by many it is indisputable that they were world-shaking, effecting the entire subsequent history in profound ways. Surprisingly, our knowledge of how encounter actually occurred is poor and underdeveloped, based mostly on the interpretations of Spanish writers and a few others who all had specific agendas in recording events. Such documentary sources, while valuable, only tell an incomplete story and reveal little of the day-to-day lives of Spanish and native, alike, as they worked through the painful processes of conversion, domination, resistance, and defiance. The excellent preservation qualities of the Peruvian desert, however, have yielded up evidence of the small things forgotten of every day life in preliminary work and thus this archaeological project will be able to offer a unique view of such processes.<br/><br/>The nature of the research questions to be investigated concern the degree to which Spanish and native in a local, specific setting conformed to the larger dictates of policy makers. As but one example, preliminary work suggests that the lay-out of the town and church complex did not conform to Spanish regulations but was adjusted to local conditions - the church was placed directly in front of a prehispanic temple that had been abandoned but was still venerated by local people. The project will explore this and other evidence of the degree to which Spaniard and native compromised the policies of distant authorities in order to find ways to live together. Were the native people in the town under heavy guard and was the settlement fortified or were conditions more flexible and open? Did Spanish priests allow the practice of native religions, to some degree, or was a strict enforcement of Christian practice maintained? To what degree was the local economy tied in to the larger economic system of the Spanish Empire and to what degree were native practices in agriculture and food-ways maintained? These and other questions will be addressed in the research.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the study are that it will contribute significant information on how radically different cultures interacted. It will help to determine how accurate a picture the documentary sources are in relation to archaeological data. In our contemporary world in which the clash of cultures and values has become increasingly important this study of one of the great cultural confrontations of history may offer much to consider for our own times.<br/>

This project will carry out a one hundred square degree multi-band optical survey of the southern sky, in conjunction with even deeper images of smaller fields, coordinated with a millimeter-wave survey that will map the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to detect galaxy clusters out to moderate redshifts.  These coordinated surveys will enable the most precise cosmological study to date with galaxy clusters, and will enable complementary studies of the dark energy using supernova distances, cosmic shear, and the galaxy power spectrum.  This research will use the NSF-supported Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, and the privately supported Magellan telescope, both operational in Chile, and the CMB data will come from the NSF-funded South Pole Telescope, currently under construction.<br/><br/>The key science question of the dark energy has already engaged significant public interest.  This research will leverage the scientific productivity of multiple NSF-funded facilities, break new ground in real-time image analysis and observing optimization, directly benefit future large surveys currently in the planning stages, and continue a tradition of graduate and undergraduate student participation.

Rice (principal investigator)<br/>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences<br/>Harvard University, Cambridge, MA<br/><br/>Earthquakes occur because fault strength weakens with increasing slip or slip rate. The aim of this work is to identify the physical processes underlying that weakening, and to analyze their consequences for the dynamics of earthquake rupture.  The focus is on mature crustal faults, capable of producing large earthquakes. Recent field observations suggest that slip in individual events then occurs primarily within a thin shear zone, < 1-5 mm, within a finely granulated (ultracataclastic) fault core. Since energy is dissipated in a narrow zone, the relevant weakening processes in large crustal events might, therefore, be expected to be thermal in origin. <br/><br/>Our preparatory work for this study has assembled a strong case that primary weakening mechanisms during significant crustal earthquakes are thermal, and involve the following: (1) Thermal pressurization of groundwater that is resident within the (slightly) porous fault gouge, due to frictional heating of the gouge, and (2) Flash heating at highly stressed frictional micro-contacts which, at high slip rates like during earthquakes, causes them to lose their normally high shear strength even before they have slid out of existence. Elementary modeling of these mechanisms has been constrained with recently determined poroelastic and transport properties of fault core materials, and with recent high-speed friction studies.<br/><br/>Predictions are that strength drop should often be nearly complete at slip of order 1 m, and that the onset of melting should be precluded over much of the seismogenic zone, except in large slip events. These are qualitatively consistent with low heat outflow from major faults and a scarcity of glass (pseudotachylyte) that would be left from rapid re-cooling. A more quantitatively testable prediction is of the shear fracture energies that would be implied if actual earthquake ruptures were controlled by those thermal mechanisms. Seismic observations have been processed to allow inference of the fracture energy of large crustal events, including its variation with slip in an event. It is found that the seismic results are plausibly described by the theoretical predictions, thus supporting the possibility that such thermal weakening prevails in the earth.<br/><br/> This project focuses on consolidating those new advances, on expanding the modeling of the underlying physics to allow characterization of fault zone response under the highly variable slip rates of natural events, and on applying that understanding, embodied in constitutive relations, along with techniques of dynamic fracture simulation, to revisit a set of important problems in the dynamics of earthquakes, including their nucleation, propagation and arrest. We plan to develop viable methodologies of dynamic rupture analysis which incorporate these thermal mechanisms, in a 2D boundary integral equation formulations and, for more robust 2D and 3D applications, in an explicit-dynamics finite-element formulation. The problem of localization of shearing into a thin zone in otherwise stable granular lithologies will be addressed, as well as its relation to arrest of rupture as the slip zone attempts to penetrate hot regions of inherently stable, rate-strengthening, frictional response. Principles of fault operation under low overall driving stress are to be elaborated for such models of statically strong but dynamically weak fault response.<br/>

This project will predict this signal, to understand better the power of this approach, to select the optimal angular scales and frequency ranges, to determine the best statistics to use, and to quantify the effects of foregrounds.  Studying the primordial seeds should constrain the physics responsible for the generation of those perturbations, providing a window into the earliest evolution of the Universe (the epoch of inflation).  This might also have important implications for fundamental physics.  Analytic and numerical models of the epoch of reionization will both explore parameter space and calibrate against detailed physics.<br/><br/>This work is vitally important to experiments to detect and measure redshifted 21 cm emission, motivating optimal design and observing strategies.  Broad dissemination of results and the engagement of students from under-represented groups will spread the benefits of this research, training the next generation of scientists in this emerging area of cosmology.

In addition to the systematic<br/>analysis and of earthquakes and dissemination of earthquake information,<br/>the research also includes the development of a dynamic earthquake<br/>moment-tensor database. The new catalog will be searchable on the<br/>web, and will include auxiliary data, such as information about the<br/>seismograms and Earth model used in the analysis, the quality of<br/>the solution, and any history of updates to the results.<br/>A second component of the project is an examination of previously<br/>undetected earthquakes. More than 1,800 events with magnitudes greater<br/>than 4.7 have recently been found using a new detection algorithm, and<br/>a substantial subset of these are clearly not common earthquakes.<br/>The effort will involve a first-order, systematic analysis<br/>of the new events to determine why they eluded earlier<br/>detection (e.g., whether all of the events lack high-frequency<br/>radiation and are thus slow earthquakes) and the specific tectonic<br/>(or non-tectonic) explanations for several specific groups of<br/>detections, including (1) events associated with volcanic eruptions<br/>or collapses; (2) events associated with glaciers in Alaska, Antarctica,<br/>and Greenland; and (3) events off the coast of North Carolina,<br/>possibly associated with submarine slumping.

We will apply these paradigms to engineer man-made systems that require decentralized coordination and structure formation - for example, programming swarms of robots that assemble temporary scaffolds, space enclosures, and physical distribution networks that may be used for various construction and industrial applications in the future. We will also apply these models to directly study tissue morphogenesis - for example, to investigate how local mechanical and chemical cues can cause global adaptation of tissue morphology and even switching of morphology in endothelial cells. Through this effort, we aim to better understand how genetic information and environmental cues combine at the agent (cell) level, to generate structures that exhibit optimized form and function at the whole-system level.<br/><br/>

Giant astronomical surveys will soon monitor much of the sky regularly, detecting vast numbers of interesting, variable astronomical objects. These objects will range from small solar system bodies to distant quasars; in the middle of the range of scales the surveys will find planets around other stars when they transit (pass in front of) their parent stars. The objective of this proposal is to get ready for this new treasure trove. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project is: (1) developing new, scalable techniques to identify extra-solar planets in synoptic survey data, and (2) preserving novelty detection when the volume of data becomes so large that the scientists are removed from the data. The goal is to discover new extra-solar planets.<br/><br/>The outcome of this project will be new techniques for mining these extremely massive databases, and a preliminary survey for candidate planets.  This will enable follow-up work to scour new data as they become available.  The datamining tools will have impact that extends beyond the needs of astronomy. The screening of time-series data for interesting events occurs in many arenas, ranging from national defense to the tracking of commercial transactions.<br/>

In addition, faculty at nearby Wesley College will have access to the NMR.  <br/><br/>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have a significant impact in synthetic organic chemistry. <br/>

Magnetic, gravity, swath bathymetry and multi-channel seismic data will be acquired from the southern end of the Adare Basin to the northern parts of the Northern Basin and Central Trough in the Ross Embayment. Previous surveys documented 170 km of regional extension between forty-three and twenty-six million years ago, which resulted in some seafloor spreading in the Adare Basin. However, the relationship of Adare Basin spreading to the overall extension and the southward continental basins of the Ross Embayment has not been established. This relationship is critical to understanding the tectonic evolution of East and West Antarctica and linking Pacific plate motions to the rest of the world. The study will also offer unique insight into rifting processes by studying the transition of rifting between oceanic and continental lithosphere. In terms of broader impacts, this project will support two graduate students and field research experience for undergraduates. The project also involves cooperation between scientists from the US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.

Movies Of Accretion And Outflow 10 - 1000 AU From A Massive YSO  <br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Dr. Elizabeth Humphreys, at the Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), along with co-investigators Claire Chandler at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and Lincoln Greenhill at the SAO, will undertake a program to directly map and track the 3-D dynamics of gas around a massive, a deeply embedded young stellar object (YSO) in the Orion KL region (radio source I).  The region to be studied is at radii of 10 to 1000 Astronomical Units from the source, where outflow of material is launched from an accretion disk. The source is the closest known massive YSO, and the only target for which this type of study can be undertaken.  <br/><br/>An outcome of the research program will be a movie of a star in formation, which will serve as the cornerstone of a CD-ROM and web-based education program.  The program will be developed with the SAO Science Education Department, and will be directed toward students and the general public through dissemination to schools, planetaria and museums. Additionally, calibrated data and images will be stored in a publicly accessible web archive, and undergraduate student involvement in the research is anticipated.<br/>

To test the hypothesis that the learning styles of current students in engineering and business differ, and that technology-based learning is perhaps more appropriate for a diverse student population, this project will create and use a network-based computer game to test this research in an interdisciplinary setting.<br/><br/>The research to be explored is: Does introduction of concepts through group game play foster deeper understanding of interdisciplinary material? A board game, created by an MS student supported on an earlier CAREER award of the PI, simulate the supply chain for a large manufacturing operation, with the goal that students learn the underlying principles of optimization; in this case trying to maximize profit while minimizing environmental impact. This project will create a web-based version of the game to test the second objective, can today's student learn new materials by playing multiple iterations of a web-based game designed to meet their learning styles? <br/><br/>This is a high potential, high risk project where if this successful demonstrates the feasibility of using web-based technologies in a gaming methodology to meet different learning style needs effectively for a diverse group of engineering and business students, the broader impact upon teaching methods in engineering design and decision-making could be transformative for the engineering curriculum. The risks involved include the concern that while engineering students may enjoy this technological gaming approach, this may not be an effective learning mechanism and the students may not learn the desired material. A second risk is that the technology gap between different groups of students may not have closed sufficiently to assure advancing diversity rather than disenfranchising less technically adept students. <br/>

Economic activity can be seen as comprising complex chains of exchanges, or markets, for which money and prices are the essential lubricant. Our working assumption and motivation is that a collection of more or less simple procedures underlie the actions of participants in the actual economy. Accordingly, the goal of this work is to better understand price adjustment mechanisms that operate<br/>independently on each price yet achieve a coordinated outcome. The proposed research has two main parts.<br/>I. To explain why price changes in market economies might work effectively by showing simple distributed<br/>algorithms that cause prices to converge quickly toward equilibrium values.<br/>II. To consider price (toll) setting in networks, motivated in part by routing and road networks.<br/>Intelectual merit In both areas, the focus will be on tatonnement-style algorithms. These are methods in<br/>which each price is adjusted independently. Local algorithms are of particular interest; these are algorithms<br/>in which the price adjustment is based only on information available to the corresponding price setter. A<br/>prime obstacle to such methods is the 1978 lower bound of Saari and Simon which seemingly shows that such<br/>algorithms have unduly high information requirements. The approach used in this work sidesteps that lower<br/>bound, by using variable rate updates. The following is a summary of the issues that will be investigated.<br/>I. MARKET PRICES<br/>Continuous Markets: Develop fast, convergent, local algorithms, using updates based on excess demand.<br/>Discrete Markets: What is the effect of indivisibility of goods and discreteness of prices on such<br/>algorithms?<br/>Markets over Time: How can time be incorporated into the model, and how does this affect the properties<br/>of the tatonnement algorithms?<br/>Production: How does incorporating production into the model affects the properties of tatonnement<br/>algorithms?<br/>Markets as Networks: Is it useful to view trading relationships as a graph?<br/>This approach based on local, variable updates shows potential with regard both to enabling asynchronous<br/>price updates, and yielding a dynamic algorithm (that is one that can respond effectively to external changes,<br/>such as in utilities or resources).<br/>II. NETWORK PRICES. Here, the situation is fairly well understood when there is full knowledge of user<br/>utilities. In this work, the focus will be on the situation when these are unknown or changing. This work<br/>asks:<br/>When can tolls be set effectively based on user behavior as manifested in congestion?<br/>Local tatonnement algorithms are again a main interest, although more global algorithms, corresponding to<br/>a single network owner, will also be considered. This work will examine a variety of other issues including:<br/>Types of user traffic: e.g. elastic versus inelastic traffic, and splittable versus unsplittable demands (a<br/>demand is a single user's traffic).<br/>Measures of traffic quality: rates of flow versus transit delays.<br/>Network mechanisms: In particular, the use of buffering.

AST/RO is one of only two Terahertz observatories in the world, and has two Terahertz instruments, the Terahertz Receiver with NbN HEB Device (TREND)  and the South Pole Imaging Fabry-Perot Interferometer (SPIFI), currently operational on the telescope. AST/RO has recently completed two key observatory projects which demonstrate its unique capabilities for mapping the dominant cooling lines of molecular material in the Milky Way. AST/RO has observed these lines with arcminute resolution over regions of sky which are several degrees in size. Radiative transfer models based on these measurements can determine the internal thermodynamic properties of molecular clouds, providing insights about the star formation process and the dynamics of cloud formation and destruction in the Galactic environment. For example, the Galactic Center key project data show that the smooth ring of molecular material 150 parsecs from the Galactic Center is on the verge of coagulating into a single, massive molecular cloud like the one surrounding Sgr B2, and will undergo a burst of star formation. The AST/RO project has observed, reduced, published and publicly released on the Internet a large fraction of all spectral line observations in the frequency octave from 450 to 900 GHz. The proven capabilities of AST/RO will provide critical collaborative observations for the newly-launched Spitzer Space Telescope (SST, see http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu).<br/>

This technique will probe structures on a micro-arc second scale that would otherwise be impossible with more traditional imaging techniques. The theoretical models developed by Dr. Vrtilek and her co-investigators will also be converted to the Doppler coordinate frame to facilitate comparisons with the observations. The specific goal here is a better understanding of the structure of disks surrounding compact objects, possible differences between those hosting neutron stars versus black holes, and the physics of the accretion flows involved. Other activities will include further developing this technique to include sinusoidal time variations and developing models for eventual uv and x-ray tomography.<br/><br/>The training of a graduate student is supported who will also incorporate results from this project in a Ph.D. thesis. Undergraduate students taking part in the NSF sponsored Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory will also be involved. It is expected that the tomographic tools developed here will have application in many areas of astronomy, particularly with interacting binary stars.

Casanova of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale to work with Dr. Gabriel A. Gonzalez of Universidad Catolica del Norte in Antofagasta, Chile, as well as with Dr. Ulrich Radtke at the University of Cologne in Germany, on a dissertation enhancement project entitled Morphotectonic Evolution of the Mejillones Peninsula, Northern Chile Using Precise GPS Measurement of Uplifted Coastal Terraces.  This peninsula was largely inaccessible until the last few years.  It contains a sequence of uplifted coastal terraces that rank among the best in the world.  At least 13 distinct terrace levels are present, and because of the extreme aridity, is unmatched in preserved terrace morphology, terrace-capping sedimentary deposits and the abundant fossil material preserved in those deposits.  The goal of this research is to map, precisely measure and analyze this sequence.  The results would add to the worldwide databse of terrace-based sea-level information, investigating local climate evolution, and documenting the Plio-Pleistocene tectonic evolution of the sediment-starved Chilean subduction complex.  Dr. Radtke will train Ms. Casanova in the Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) dating technique.  ESR is done on fossil mollusk shells that will be collected on each identified terrace level.<br/><br/>Results of this project will be posted on a bilingual website for geology students in the U.S. and Chile.<br/>

These lakes are unique in their age, stratification, perennial ice cover, and location in closed basins. The consequence of these factors is a high susceptibility to climate change, which their stratified waters record in much the same way that sedimentary rocks record geologic processes. This project will sample three lakes from varied settings. Water samples will be analyzed for major ions, dissolved gases, stable isotopes, and isotopes of helium, chlorine and iodine, each of which offers a unique perspective on the water's source, age, and recent communication with the atmosphere. Results will be coupled with information on lake levels, hypolimnia formations, and ice cover occurrence to understand lake history and Holocene climate.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this work supports graduate and undergraduate research, and development of an on-line site describing lake chemistry and biology. The work also has application to understanding the transport of brine in polar settings, which is relevant to nuclear waste repositories. <br/>
0517937	Probing the Electrostatics of Lipid Bilayer Membranes	CHE	ANALYTICAL SEPARATIONS & MEAS.	08/01/2005	06/05/2007	Jason Hafner	TX	William Marsh Rice University	Continuing grant	Zeev Rosenzweig	07/31/2009	$300,000.00		hafner@rice.edu	6100 MAIN ST	Houston	TX	770051827	7133484820	MPS	1974	0000, 7237, OTHR	$0.00	Professor Jason Hafner of Rice University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to investigate electrostatic potentials at membrane interfaces.  The goal of the project is to understand charge distribution in lipid membranes and how that affects lipid aggregation and ultimately the structure of lipid membranes. The charge distribution and contributions from ion binding and dipoles from the lipids are being measured and mapped out using a novel charge-based nanoscale imaging technique developed by this group. The scanning probe instrument is called a Fluid Electric Force Microscope (FEFM), which is a version of an atomic force microscope (AFM) but uses the native electrostatic charge of the AFM tip to detect surface charge on the membrane. The AFM scans over the surface first to obtain topographic information from van der Waals interactions, then runs over the same trace again but now in a lift-off mode following the topography from the previous trace allowing the tip to now capture electrostatic information. The measurement technique has already been developed and has shown that it can distinguish between positively, negatively, and neutrally charged surfaces. In order to decipher and separate the multiple forces within the membrane (e.g., electrostatic, dipolar, hydrophobic, viscoelastic, and van der Waals interactions) that can influence both the topographic and charge mapping measurement, the team is characterizing the membrane's ion affinity using ion binding studies, dipole density through changes in the Debye length, and lipid phases in the membrane. They are achieving this by  establishing the effective charge of the probe tip,  controlling the solution ionic strength to ensure that the charge scan is run above the Debye length, measuring ion binding constants for different lipids with various ions, and determining the electrostatic contribution from lipid phases. Finally, the control of lipid bilayer dimensions by using the solution ionic strength is being examined. <br/><br/>Electrostatic interactions are primary driving forces controlling molecular interactions at membrane interfaces. These play a critical role in determining the behavior and chemistry that takes place at the surfaces of all biological cells. Understanding the electrostatic charge distribution in the cell membrane is currently poor. Most of the attention is drawn towards specific interactions, such as protein-ligand recognition or raft formation through specific lipid combinations. Electrostatics are typically the domain of non-specific interactions. However, electrostatic interactions have astonishing effects on lipid phase transitions that could play a large role in raft formation in cell membranes, long range recognition properties that lead to specific host-guest complexation, cellular signaling for apoptosis, and facilitation of changes in membrane morphology during cell division or endo/exocytosis. Many studies have been performed to characterize the contribution of membrane charge with regard to these various phenomena, but they are mostly global or macroscopic measurements. To truly understand the contributions of electrostatic charge on cellular membranes, or even synthetic membrane systems, it is imperative to characterize the system at the nanoscopic level. It is highly likely that charge aggregation in nanoscale domains, such as in the partitioning of gangliosides in lipid rafts, is the activator for protein binding at specific sites in membranes. This project enables a first look into such phenomena with unprecedented resolution.   <br/><br/>The concepts that are being developed in this project would have a very broad impact on the biophysics community in their understanding of cellular membrane systems. Furthermore, research on lipid membrane materials is growing both at the scientific and technological fronts for drug delivery vehicles, sensor materials, biocompatible interfaces, detection array platforms, and as models for cell membranes. Understanding lipid organization is key to understanding how membrane materials function in each of these systems. Successful outcomes of this research may enable us to, for example, tune materials to selectively capture toxin molecules from solution for sensing and separations, or toggle ion channels for fuel cells or water purification. <br/>

It is now widely accepted that the key to understanding biological function, and subsequently disease, is to understand the structure, flexibility, kinetics, and dynamics of the body's worker molecules, proteins. Recent successes in understanding the structure and dynamics of proteins using computational analysis underscore the importance of developing computational methodologies to explore the fundamental principles of protein flexibility. Representing a protein by a single configuration is less and less attractive, as such a representation does not represent the dynamical interplay of different conformations that can regulate protein function and does not fully characterize the protein's interaction with neighboring molecules.<br/><br/>This proposal will develop a computational framework for the characterization of protein flexibility at equilibrium conditions through a combination of geometric/robotic and biophysics methods. The proposed work lies at the intersection of computer science and modern biophysics, and will benefit both communities. On the computational side, it will lead to new methodologies and paradigms to model physical systems with high flexibility, complex geometry, multiple constraints, and continuous motion. Successful robotics and computational geometry methods will be adapted to support the large-scale analysis required for biological applications. On the biophysical side, novel theories and methodologies will be developed and tested for modeling proteins at different resolutions. Quantitative connections between theory and experiment will be pursued. The proposed work has the potential to dramatically affect major unresolved problems on the inner workings of protein systems.<br/><br/>

Nodes either operate correctly, or<br/>cease to work altogether (i.e., fail-stop). This model is quite successful when nodes<br/>can trust one another, but this limits overlay systems from operating in the more general<br/>case when they might be operating on untrusted, end-user computers. Such users will be<br/>economically rational, meaning they will seek to get as much benefit from the network as<br/>possible while contributing as little of their own resources. Our research will examine<br/>extensions to these systems where nodes perform accounting, allowing them to track<br/>which nodes are and are not performing correctly, making it possible to offer preferential<br/>service to nodes that offer preferential service in return. These and other related<br/>techniques will ultimately result in incentives-compatible designs that enable a new<br/>generation of peer-to-peer applications, including distributed backup systems, distributed<br/>file systems, and distributed email systems. Our work will be disseminated as part of the<br/>FreePastry project, which provides a high-quality and scalable implementation of a<br/>variety of overlay network services and is available under a BSD-style license. Likewise,<br/>our work will become part of the next-generation Tor anonymous communication system.
0539044	Applications of Noncommutative Algebra to Low-Dimensional Topology and Geometry	DMS	TOPOLOGY	07/15/2005	07/15/2005	Shelly Harvey	TX	William Marsh Rice University	Standard Grant	Joanna Kania-Bartoszynska	06/30/2008	$107,992.00		shelly@rice.edu	6100 MAIN ST	Houston	TX	770051827	7133484820	MPS	1267	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The principal investigator proposes to continue the investigation of topology and geometry of low-dimensional manifolds using invariants that arise from non-commutative algebra and von Neumann Algebras.  These reflect the highly non-commutative nature of the fundamental group. In previous work, the PI showed that this type of invariant gives estimates for the Thurston norm of a 3-manifold, obstruct a 3-manifold fibering over the circle, obstruct the existence of a symplectic structure on certain 4-manifolds, give new information about the structure of the link concordance group, and obstruct a group being the fundamental group of a 3-manifold or having positive deficiency.  The PI proposes to find new interesting non-commutative algebraic invariants and to apply these invariants to questions in low-dimensional topology; for example, homology cobordism of 3-manifolds (and link concordance), symplectic structures of 4-manifolds, genera of contact structures of 3-manifolds, Betti numbers of finite covers of 3-manifolds, and depth of foliations of 3-manifolds. The PI also proposes to find a specific relationship between her invariants of a three manifold and the Heegard Floer Homology of a 3-manifold.<br/><br/>Topology is the study of the continuous change of space (by stretching or twisting but not tearing).  In this project, the PI will focus on spaces that are locally modelled on 3-dimensional space (the space that we live in) and 4-dimensional space (3-dimensional space along with a time dimension).  These are called 3 and 4-dimensional manifolds respectively.One of the ways that we can better understand these spaces is via their fundamental group.  The fundamental group isan algebraic object associated to any topological space which measures the number of holes in <br/>a the space.  It is defined as the set of loops starting and ending at a point.  We can formally multiply loops in the fundamental group as follows.  If A is a loop and B is another loop, we define A times B, denoted AB, to be the loop obtained by first traversing A and then traversing B.  The multiplication of loops is non-commutative as in matrix multiplication.  That is, AB is not the same as BA, since traversing A then B is not the same as traversing B then A. Unfortunately,the fundamental group of a space is quite difficult to understand.  In this project, the PI will use noncommutative algebraic techniques to better understand the fundamental group and hence better <br/>understand the 3 and 4-dimensional manifolds themselves.  For example, one of the non-commutative techniques the PI will use involves matrices which are no longer finite but have an infinite number of rows and columns.<br/>

This award will support a project focused on developing effective techniques to study this energy difference, or protein stability, at the molecular level. The studies will aid our understanding of protein stability, and ultimately our understanding of the role of protein stability in proper functioning under physiological conditions. Atomic force spectroscopy is a technique used to measure the behavior of molecules under a stretching or twisting force. Application of this technique to important molecules such as human cardiac titin will lead to understanding of how the muscle functions in heart. A new course on molecular biophysics will be developed. Students and postdoctoral associates will have the opportunity to learn to use the state-of-the art instrument for biophysics research. This project receives support from the Division of Materials Research and the Physics Division.<br/><br/>***TECHNICAL ABSTRACT***<br/><br/>This individual investigator award will support single-molecule studies of protein free energy landscapes by dynamic force spectroscopy using atomic force microscopy.  The goal is to obtain equilibrium information about nanoscale biomolecular systems from non-equilibrium measurements. State-of-the art atomic force microscopy capable of manipulating single molecules at the nanometer scale and detecting forces with pico-newton accuracy will be used to measure the force-extension of single proteins. The recently derived Jarzynski equality, which relates the probability distribution of nonequilibrium work values to the equilibrium free energy difference, will be used to determine the free energy changes as proteins undergo mechanical transformations.  The unfolding free energy curves of titin, the giant muscle protein responsible for the passive tension of heart muscles, will be obtained using Jarzynski's equality.  The broader impact of this program includes the development of a novel measurement and analysis tool for solving basic biophysical problems and the training of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates in nanobiophysics.

These methods combine an existing FFT-based<br/>method for integrating over smooth regions of the inhomogeneity, with an<br/>accelerated, high-order accurate integration scheme, for small regions<br/>near scatterer discontinuities.  The PI also proposes to develop<br/>preconditioning strategies through two distinct lines of investigation:<br/>(1) preconditioning by means of a perturbation expansion about a simple,<br/>piecewise-constant, radially layered inhomogeneity and (2) preconditioning<br/>by means of the infinite frequency limit of the problem, i.e., geometrical<br/>optics.  To pursue a preconditioner based on geometrical optics, an<br/>effective method for computing the multi-valued solution to the eikonal<br/>equation in inhomogeneous media (capturing the reflection and refraction<br/>at discontinuous interfaces) will be developed by building on a recently<br/>developed phase-space-based level set method, which combines a spectral<br/>representation in the phase variables with a discontinuous Galerkin<br/>finite-element discretization in the spatial variables.<br/><br/>The use of numerical methods to evaluate the scattering of waves by<br/>complex material structures plays an important role in an enormous range<br/>of scientific and engineering technologies.  Examples include radar and<br/>remote sensing, medical and biological imaging (e.g., CT-scans,<br/>ultrasound), laser-plasma interactions (e.g., in laser-driven fusion),<br/>photonic crystal design, nondestructive testing, neutron and electron<br/>diffraction, and exploration seismology.  At the same time, the ever<br/>increasing size and complexity of material structures of practical<br/>interest place many problems beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art<br/>computational methods, thus requiring new and innovative mathematical<br/>approaches.  The PI proposes to develop new efficient and highly accurate<br/>computational methods for such problems to enable the treatment of larger<br/>and more complex scattering structures.<br/>

The core theme is that distributed signal processing and data assimilation of sensor data, as well as network management and monitoring, should be performed inside the sensor network in order to reduce energy consumption and global communication needs, leading to dramatically increased sensor lifetimes and much higher fidelity in the tracking of the physical phenomena of interest. The goal is to develop a flexible, self-monitoring architecture for this type of in-network processing and sensor networking that exploits adaptivity to significantly improve the network's efficiency, robustness, and usefulness. Two kinds of adaptivity are considered: (1) data adaptivity, where the network topology is adapted to align communications with the natural data flows; and (2) resource adaptivity, where the network topology is adapted based on computational, battery, or bandwidth resources. The expected results include the development of adaptive communication protocols and routing topology, the development of network management tools for sensor communication performance monitoring and inference, and for sensor distribution monitoring, as well as the experimental deployment of the adaptive sensor network architecture in a small-scale testbed of sensor nodes on the Rice University campus. Results will be disseminated through technical reports posted on the project web page, through papers presented at professional meetings, as well as through journal publications.

This area was recently selected by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) as a fast Emerging Research Front in Computer Science. The project has three major directions of research using tools and techniques from the membrane computing area. The first concerns the simulation of cells using concepts from P systems implemented in the E-cell package. To help the simulation of cells the second research area focuses on defining models of P systems that mimic the processes in the cell. The PIs have already, as a preliminary result, one such example of a model of P systems that has several features not found in any other previous P system models: binding of objects and genetic information. Another major novelty of the proposed model is that time is associated with each rule.  The PIs plan to search for other suitable models, and also work on the more theoretical aspects of the P systems: developing efficient algorithms (e,g.,  considering reachability between system configurations), and investigating important and fundamental computational issues in the models considered. The third area complements the first two: research in the area of P systems simulators. While in the first area the interest is in simulating cells using, among other ideas, the models developed in the second area; the third research focus goes in the opposite direction - simulation of P systems rather than the simulation of cells. This area of research complements the first two, since such a simulator for a bio-relevant P system could answer practical questions raised from biology. An ambitious goal of the whole project is to capture in these mathematical models the way the cells self-configure and self-maintain and view it as computation. These investigations could yield new ideas and useful models for computation inspired by the extraordinary system that is a cell.  The proposed project topic is new, with great promise to significantly impact several areas. In Biology the project will help explore, model and simulate differential gene expression during various biological processes and transcriptional and signaling networks on a larger scale than the current capabilities; in Computer Science the research could yield new paradigms and new computing techniques (as has happened in the discovery of genetic algorithms and neural networks). One of the major contributions of this project will be the applications of a good cell-simulator in many areas - such a software would be an invaluable tool for designing and testing new drugs; for predicting the behavior of a specific type of cell in a specific environment; and, lastly, for teaching and gaining more knowledge and insight about the extraordinary systems that we call the cells.<br/><br/><br/>

It is engaged in refining the ASA college-level curriculum and further developing innovative pedagogical materials for a college-level introductory sociology course. A second goal is also being pursued, identification of conditions leading to successful student learning, especially among women and members of racial/ethnic minorities who are underrepresented in social science fields. Particular attention is being paid to developing their abilities to integrate, synthesize, and interpret information and enhancing their literacy and quantitative skills. <br/>The intellectual merit of the project derives from the fact that the new course will result in deeper and more lasting student learning by all types of students. It will increase our knowledge of how underrepresented groups can more successfully learn social science concepts and methods. <br/>Significant broader impacts will be realized ultimately from the widespread adoption of this new national model for a college-level introductory sociology course. The following course features are contributing to the broader impacts: a greatly strengthened curricular content, increased reliance on inquiry-based teaching resources, significant student experience in using major national datasets and tools, and formative feedback from companion assessment materials. Further, as an outgrowth of this projects' linking of practicing sociologists, junior college, college, and university faculty (and high school teachers), the project is developing new networks to enhance teacher training and student involvement in research. <br/><br/>The project evaluation is employing field observations of classes, videotapes of classes, interviews of teachers and students, analysis of the content of student assessment materials, and students' performances on the new assessments. Assessment of these collected data is providing the basis for a further round of modifications of the curriculum, teaching resources, and assessment tools. The project website and discussion board is permitting sociology instructors to share questions, problems, strategies, and materials.<br/>By project completion there will be a well-refined curriculum, a set of teaching materials that are aligned with it, and systematic assessment of how they work. These will be shared at professional associations of sociologists, educational researchers, and high school teachers, in professional and general public publications, and made available through the American Sociological Association.

Both areas are very active experimentally, and present important puzzles and challenges to existing theory.<br/>The spintronics project has several specific goals. A proper hydrodynamic theory of spin transport will be developed, with microscopic derivations of transport coefficients. Specific problems are to determine the structure of spin-charge coupling terms, their dependence upon various scattering processes, and experimental means of measuring these effects. Another project is spin relaxation in ferromagnetic diluted magnetic semiconductor materials, and how this enters the appropriate hydrodynamics. Finally, the non-hydrodynamic regime of single quantum spins will be considered,<br/>including their coherence effects and relaxation mechanisms. This research benefits from, and complements, existing experimental expertise in spintronics at UCSB.<br/>The project on unconventional phases and transitions is motivated by the realization in recent work that simple reasonable models can exhibit phases and quantum critical points completely outside the usual paradigms. Thus this project is aimed both at applying the emerging new conceptual framework to recent and long-standing puzzles in experimentally interesting materials, and, to a lessor extent, at extending and systematizing the framework itself. Some of the experimental phenomena to be studied are Mott charge ordering transitions, charge and spin frustration in spinels and rare earth intermetallics and their connection to heavy fermion behavior, and spin liquid states in organic and inorganic triangular lattice magnets. These problems will be addressed by a variety of analytical (field theory, renormalization group, gauge theory, bosonization) and numerical (exact diagonalization, variation wavefunction) techniques. The PI is familiar with a wide variety of such approaches, and has made substantial contributions in these fields prior to this grant.<br/>Intellectual Merit: These projects represent two different frontiers of condensed matter physics. Control and measurement of spin is undergoing an experimental revolution in techniques (e.g. time-resolved optical pump-probe spectroscopy, strain engineering of spin-orbit interactions, etc.) and materials (diluted magnetic semiconductors, digital magnetic structures). New mechanisms of collective quantum order and emergent behavior are reinvigorating the theoretical investigation of old outstanding problems - and suggesting new ones - in strongly correlated materials. Both fields are thus ripe for bringing new theoretical ideas into application, and thereby advancing the fundamental knowledge base of condensed matter physics.<br/>Broader Impacts: First and foremost, this work is designed to motivate and explain experiments and properties of materials. Moreover, the hydrodynamic models to be developed in the spintronics portion of the proposal in fact describe macroscopic transport phenomena: they are the spin analogs of Ohm's law for charge conduction. Detailed models of this type are clearly crucial for any applications. Educationally, graduate students and postdocs will be trained in these forefront areas of condensed matter theory, and new course materials will be developed to communicate the<br/>excitement of the fields to new students. A comprehensive web site with colloquial and graduate student level explanations of the research will be developed to further communicate to a broader audience.

The education component focuses on developing an innovative course for teaching condensed matter physics to undergraduate students. <br/>The PI plans to reformulate the semiconductor Bloch equations within time-dependent density functional theory to study nonequilibrium carrier dynamics in photoexcited bulk semiconductors and semiconductor heterostructures on femtosecond to picosecond time scales. Time dependent density functional theory offers a computationally tractable formalism for describing dynamical correlation effects. The PI aims to evolve a more realistic theoretical picture by developing a formal framework that includes non-parabolic bands beyond the effective mass approximation, a treatment of exchange and correlation accounting for memory and retardation effects, and a microscopic description of disorder scattering of hot electron distributions. The PI will investigate whether a spatially long-ranged exchange-correlation potential together with the reformulated semiconductor Block equations can capture ultrafast excitonic dynamics. Previous work using long ranged exchange-correlation potentials did not enter the nonlinear ultrafast regime to be explored by this work. The PI ultimately aims to apply this formal framework to the coherent control of nonlinear intersubband effects such as optical bistability, harmonic generation, terahertz pulse shaping, and populating selected excited subbands.<br/>In the education component, the PI will focus on education in condensed matter physics. The PI plans to develop an upper undergraduate level condensed matter physics course including: (1) a course content that emphasizes topics at the forefront of modern science and technology, (2) interactive hands-on computer simulations, (3) student group projects that involve developing simulation programs. A public web site will also be created to make newly developed simulation routines available under the GNU General Public License. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION:<br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical research on quantum mechanical states of electrons in semiconductors that result from illumination by light. Recent advances in laser technology have opened a frontier where the quantum mechanical states of electrons are prepared and probed by very short pulses of laser light. The PI will develop a theoretical technique to describe how electrons in semiconductors respond to very short pulses of laser light. The technique holds promise for a description that at once includes important materials specific information and is accessible to current computer technology. The PI plans to apply the technique to investigate the detailed dynamics of the electrons and how to prepare and control quantum mechanical states. This work is fundamental research and also contributes to the intellectual foundations of future technologies. <br/>In the education component, the PI will focus on education in condensed matter physics.

The work involves the development of techniques and protocols to analyze a promising new tracer (chlorine stable isotopes) of volcanic volatiles in subduction zone volcanic rocks on a secondary ion mass spectrometer. Chlorine stable isotopes are suspected to be important tracers of volcanic fluids and this study examines this possibility using samples from a variety of volcanic glasses. The research program includes the identification of matrix and other effects in the samples that can compromise analytical precision and accuracy of the method and analyzes a suite of twelve samples that have also been measured and calibrated on thermal ionization mass spectrometers. This duplication allows a quantitative determination of the accuracy and precision of this new in-situ technique and a comparison with results obtained by standard mass spectrometry to assess the level of confidence that can be placed on these analyses. Additional samples, that include glasses in melt inclusions trapped in crystals from volcanic rocks from back arc spreading centers in the Lau Basin in the western Pacific Ocean, will also be examined. The analyses represent the first time in-situ analyses have been made on melt inclusions in volcanic glasses.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Broader impacts of this work are to develop new techniques and protocols to permit the analysis of chlorine stable isotopes on a secondary ion mass spectrometer.

The award will also support continued operation of the collection once the move is completed in the summer of 2005. The collection, originally established many decades ago at IU, is a historically significant resource that provides animals used actively and widely in biological research. The recent and ongoing development of genome resources for the axolotl and other closely related species is expected to foster continued interest in Ambystoma as a powerful nonmammalian vertebrate model system. Most notably, axolotls are studied because they are unique among vertebrates in being able to perfectly regenerate numerous body parts. These include the spinal cord, limbs, jaw, and tail, all of which can be regenerated at any point during embryonic, larval, and adult life. Relocation of the collection to the UKY will consolidate the living stock resource with genome and bioinformatics resources currently being developed for the Ambystoma research community. The collection will not only continue to enable traditional research areas where the axolotl is the best vertebrate model system, it will also continue to take an active role in facilitating use of the organism in K-12 education and public outreach efforts.

For optical-fiber communications, the lnGaAsP quaternary III-V semiconductor material system, which is lattice-matched to InP, covers the wavelength range corresponding to low dispersion or low attenuation in optical fibers. Therefore, lasers for optical communication application with low dispersion or low attenuation have been developed and commercialized using an InGaAsP active layer grown on InP substrates. However, InP-based lasers have generally inferior characteristic performance compared to GaAs-based lasers. Especially for vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), lnP -based lasers have been problematic due to the lack of good lattice-matched distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) material combinations, which should have high refractive index contrast, low electrical resistance, and low thermal resistance. Compared to lnP-based VCSELs, GaAs-based VCSELs with AlAs/GaAs DBR mirrors have better characteristics. However, the system performance characteristics, such as the transmission capacity, are limited by the bandwidth of compatible multimode fibers, since they have a short-wavelength spectral range (?~O.85 m).<br/>To obtain high-performance long-wavelength lasers, the ideal practical combination should be that of an ~active layer emitting in the long-wavelength range compatible with the well-established GaAs-based laser technologies. The GaAs system offers several important advantages over the alternate InP-based system, including larger area wafer processing, better thermal properties higher doping concentrations, an oxidation-compatible material system, and high-performance DBR materials. Several possible approaches have been proposed and investigated. One of the most promising is explored here.<br/>The study of InAlGaAsSb epitaxial growth using MOCVD is a research topic that is of increasing interest throughout the world. The realization of high-quality epitaxial layers and heterojunctions are important elements in the development of advanced semiconductor devices, in particular, VCSELS. The research proposed here will result in the practical realization of X=1.33pm VCSELs as well as for the study of the fundamental properties of Sb-based heterojunctions and in the study of Ill-Sb quantum dots. The work of the primary topic of the study of Sb growth and fundamental properties couples directly to that of a second research topic on devices, specifically, VCSELs-an area that we are already exploring with collaborators at Agilent Technologies. This research will provide new fundamental insight into the physics of two-dimensionally confined systems in Ill-Sb materials. These topics have a strong potential for broad impact in optoelectronics and also in electronics, e.g.. high-speed electronics could be developed.

Recent model verification using field data has revealed some potentially large deficiencies in bulk microphysical parameterizations (BMPs). These problems often lead to little increase in precipitation accuracy when model grid spacing is decreased to less than a few kilometers, even for stratiform orographic precipitation. The primary objectives of this project are to use high-resolution observations to verify and improve the microphysics in mesoscale models, and to document the three-dimensional structures and physical mechanisms of orographic precipitation. This project builds on previous results obtained during first phase of the research, during which the model microphysical predictions were compared against remotely sensed (radar) observations, in situ aircraft data, and ground measurements for an IPEX (Intermountain Precipitation EXperiment) case over northeast Utah and an IMPROVE (Improvement of Microphysical PaRameterization through Observational Verification Experiment) event over the Oregon Cascades. In order to make improvements to the BMPs in the new Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model, additional cases need to be investigated, including 1-2 events from the PACific JETs (PACJET) experiment along the California coast in February 2001. In addition, this project will complete 3-4 months of high-resolution simulations over the northern Oregon Cascades in order to compare the simulated cloud structure with WSR-88D radar data. Model microphysical budgets aloft will be calculated along hydrometeor trajectories to determine the dominant microphysical processes that result in surface precipitation errors. <br/><br/>These additional field studies and long-term model comparisons with WSR-88D data will also provide an opportunity to study some of the detailed three-dimensional structures and physical mechanisms of orographic precipitation. These datasets will help verify the project's idealized modeling results, which suggest that an upstream-tilting gravity wave induced by relatively wide barriers, such as the Cascades or Sierras, can enhance the ice generation aloft and help seed the lower-level feeder cloud with ice and snow. Radar and in situ aircraft data will help illustrate how the windward orographic cloud and microphysics are modified by the mountain circulation aloft. These observational results will also be combined with high-resolution case study simulations. <br/><br/>Overall, by increasing the understanding of orographic precipitation processes and improving BMPs, this project will improve quantitative precipitation forecasting, which is a major initiative of the U.S. Weather Research Program. Deficiencies in BMPs also exist in global climate models (GCMs), since similar assumptions are made for snow and cloud water distributions. Given the importance of clouds in determining global climate change, this research also benefits the climate community. This project will involve the education and training of two graduate students and the mentoring of undergraduate research projects in real-time mesoscale modeling at Stony Brook. Project results will also be shared within the mesoscale meteorology and numerical weather prediction classes at Stony Brook. Collaboration with Eastern Regional Headquarters of the National Weather Service in the area of forecaster training on mesoscale models will be continued.

These systems are increasingly focused on a particularly powerful and exciting class of deployment: the heterogeneous or tiered sensor network. A heterogeneous sensor network contains nodes with different capabilities, such as tiny, low-power motes and higher-powered, microservers. Motes are inexpensive and require no infrastructure for long-term deployments, but also extremely constrained in memory, CPU power, and communication. Microservers, in contrast, are more efficient than motes at many computation- and memory-intensive tasks, and more readily interfaced to high-bandwidth peripherals, such as high-rate ADCs and network interfaces; but their higher energy consumption requires power infrastructure, such as solar panels, in long-term deployments. A heterogeneous system containing both motes and microservers can combine the advantages of both devices, using motes to achieve the desired spatial sensing density and microservers to achieve the desired processing power. <br/><br/>Wireless embedded sensor systems present the CISE community with an array of intertwined research challenges: real time sensing of complex and diverse phenomena, embedded computing constrained in bandwidth, energy, memory, and storage, controlled mobility, and the autonomous coordination of vast numbers of network nodes. But implementing and testing sensor network applications is daunting even aside from these challenges: many of the constraints that yield low-power, long-lifetime systems also undermine traditional methods for instrumenting and understanding program behavior. Coordinated community infrastructure can thus act as a tremendous research accelerator, and without shared infrastructure, research in the field will be significantly hampered. This project addresses a pressing need: wireless sensor network research demands a concentrated effort to develop a community resource for heterogeneous sensor systems.<br/><br/>The investigators will develop a community resource based on Emstar, a highly resilient application methodology for microservers and general heterogeneous deployments. Emstar smoothly combines simulation, emulation, and deployment, leading to qualitatively easier debugging and application analysis. An EmTOS component seamlessly integrates motes and microservers; the EmView visualizer provides unprecedented visibility into wireless sensor network communication patterns.<br/><br/>This will build on the investigators Emstar prototype which has proven its value in deployments of heterogeneous networks.<br/>With expanded functionality, integration, hardening, enhanced usability, and longer-term support, its broad array of tools will become accessible to the computer and information science and engineering community. The project will expand Emstar's flexibility, completeness, robustness, documentation, and programmability; extend its functionality by learning from targeted deployments such as seismic arrays, mobile environmental sensing, and medical informatics; and develop a robust, active Emstar community through workshops, tutorials, and mailing lists. The proposed community resource will act as a tremendous accelerator for research into heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, enabling quick and thorough exploration of socially important applications including environmental monitoring, medical and public health systems, and industrial and civic infrastructure development and management. The project will also support and develop undergraduate and graduate level project courses using Emstar, and explicitly involve an undergraduate research program targeting underrepresented minorities.

Carey<br/><br/>Mechanical Engineering Department<br/>University of California, Berkeley, CA<br/><br/>(NSF proposal 0456982)<br/><br/><br/>Project Abstract <br/>The proposed research will include development of two different types of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that will be used to explore the effects of dissolved ionic species on the interfacial region structure and heat and mass transfer in thin liquid water films. We will use the two different types of simulations to explore the effects of ionic additives in two contexts: (1) in a free thin liquid film between bulk phases, and (2) in a thin liquid film on a solid surface. The proposed MD simulations will explore how the ions affect the interfacial region structure, the interfacial tension, and the stability of water films. They will also explore the previously observed variation of the directional mass diffusion coefficients and the directional thermal conductivities in the film. In these simulations, appropriate potential functions for each species will be used to model force interactions among water molecules, ions and wall atoms. MD simulations will be run with pure water and dilute solutions of water and NaCl, and water and KCl for conditions spanning wide ranges of solute mole fraction, film thickness and system pressure. The solution simulation results will be extensively analyzed to determine how variation of ion concentration affects interfacial region structure, near interface properties, and film stability. This research will advance the state of the art for MD simulation methods and it will provide a molecular level understanding of how ions affect bubble merging processes and near-interface transport and stability in liquid water films on solid surfaces. Because these phenomena play central roles in many common boiling and condensation processes, the results of these studies will contribute to technological advancements in water quenching of cast metal parts, microevaporator design, and a number of other applications in which thin film evaporation or condensation is important. The exploration of transport in the interfacial region will clarify the mechanism of the observed anisotropic mass diffusion and heat transfer. This feature of transport in the interfacial region may be critically important in the spread of surfactants over the interface during transient processes, and in molecular assembly schemes in which construction occurs at a liquid-vapor interface. The effects of ions on interfacial phenomena in water revealed by this investigation will also contribute to the understanding of biological and environmental processes at a liquid water interface. An undergraduate research component of this research will aim to encourage underrepresented undergraduate students to consider graduate studies in MD simulation methods, advanced computing or nanoengineering.

The emphasis will be on the small and simple double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) tailed bacteriophage phi29, on the large and complex dsDNA bacteriophages T4 and even larger phiKZ, as well as on the tailless icosahedral ssDNA bacteriophage phiX174. The objectives will be to determine not only the structures, but also the molecular mechanisms by which the assembly intermediates are stabilized, how the DNA is packaged into the empty pre-assembled proheads, how each step triggers the next during viral morphogenesis, and to study the huge conformational changes that occur when the virus infects a host cell. Comparison of bacterial and animal viral systems is likely to recognize common strategies and evolutionary origins that are not as easily determined by the study of animal viruses alone. Many bacterial viruses are too awkwardly shaped to achieve a packing organization that is compact enough, with sufficient interparticle contacts, to make crystallization feasible. In addition, these viruses have numerous fibrous sensor attachments that are flexible and variable in orientation that would make crystallization impossible. Although cryoEM investigations of viruses seldom extend beyond 10-angstrom resolution at this time, these studies can be augmented by separately studying the crystal structures of the viral components expressed in suitable prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems. A pseudo-atomic resolution structure can then be obtained by fitting the individual crystal structures into the cryoEM images of the virion, assembly intermediates, or larger fragments of the native virus.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will involve undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. The PI has been active in mentoring women as well as underrepresented minority researchers. In addition, the research will be integrated in the teaching activities, including a course on crystallography. As in the past, the project will involve development of new techniques, such as combining electron microscopy and crystallography. Such techniques will be useful to the scientific community working on the structural biology of large complexes.

The long-term objective of this work is to understand the molecular events and mechanisms involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking that take place during plant cell division (cytokinesis) and plant cell expansion. During cytokinesis, one or more exocytic secretory pathways are polarized toward the plane of division - i.e., secretory vesicles move to the division site -- resulting in the de novo formation of the cytokinetic organelle known as the cell plate (a structure that is the precursor to the cell wall that will eventually divide the two halves into separate cells). Similarly, plant cell expansion is mediated through the delivery and fusion of secretory vesicles carrying membrane and cell wall components to specific sites on the plasma membrane, resulting in intercalation of new membrane and wall components to the existing cell surface and thereby cell expansion. <br/><br/>At the present time, relatively little is known about the organization of the exocytic and endocytic pathways, their interaction with the cytoskeleton, and the molecular machinery involved in these complex processes in plants. Dr. Bednarek has recently demonstrated that, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant-specific protein, SCD1, is critical for cell plate formation and polarized cell expansion. SCD1 is a 130 kDa peripheral membrane protein containing an N-terminal DENN domain (named for the human DENN protein which it resembles in terms of amino acid sequence: Differentially Expressed in Normal and Neoplastic cells) and eight C-terminal WD-40 repeats, which are commonly associated with protein-protein interactions. Although the precise function of DENN domains is not known, they have been identified in animal proteins that interact with Rabs (small GTPases that regulate secretory vesicle trafficking) and other signaling proteins including mitogen-activated protein kinases. Dr. Bednarek hypothesizes that SCD1 may regulate vesicle trafficking and/or cytoskeletal dynamics during cell division and expansion. This project has been designed to: 1) study the localization and targeting of SCD1 within the plant endomembrane system; 2) learn the identity of SCD1-associated endomembranes; and 3) identify SCD1-interacting proteins required for polarized membrane trafficking in plants. The project will use experimental approaches that integrate complementary forward and reverse molecular genetic, cytological, and biochemical approaches. The outcome of this project is expected to contribute significantly to both an understanding of the function and organization of the plant secretory pathway and its role in cell plate biogenesis and polarized cell expansion. Upon completion of the project, it is expected that the function of SCD1 in plant morphogenesis will be understood. These studies will also contribute to a general understanding of the function of DENN-domain containing proteins in membrane trafficking and signaling in other eukaryotic cells. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: This project will provide valuable research training in modern cell biology for young scientists at the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate level. Graduate students and postdoctoral research associates will also learn valuable teaching and mentoring skills by assisting undergraduate classroom instruction and by supervising undergraduate independent study projects related to the funded project. All reagents and research tools generated by this project will be distributed to other laboratories to assist in the further characterization of membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal regulation of plant growth and development.

Chlamydomonas is an excellent model system for studies of photosynthesis, flagellar biogenesis and function, signal transduction, and other aspects of cell biology. The recent completion of the genome sequence of Chlamydomonas will likely accelerate the adoption of this organism as an experimental tool. The collection, now called the Chlamydomonas Resource Center (formerly, the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center at Duke University), serves as the central repository to receive, catalogue, preserve and distribute wild type and mutant cultures of C. reinhardtii and other Chlamydomonas species in which extensive genetic analysis has been done. It also serves as the resource center to disseminate information on this organism to the international scientific community. Given its ease of culture and striking flagellar motility, Chlamydomonas is also an ideal organism for laboratory exercises for high school students and college undergraduates. Thus, the Center also provides materials and advice for students and teachers interested in adopting Chlamydomonas for classroom and individual science projects. In addition to live cultures, the Center also maintains and distributes molecular reagents useful for research on Chlamydomonas, including genomic and cDNA clones of Chlamydomonas nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genes, and cDNA libraries. A web site [http://www.chlamy.org] provides descriptions of all cultures in the collection, historical information and reference material on genetic loci and mutant alleles, genetic and molecular maps, an address directory, and an extensive bibliography.

The IQI is devoted to building the theoretical foundations of quantum information science across a broad front encompassing quantum algorithms, quantum cryptography, quantum information theory, fault-tolerant quantum information processing, and physical implementations of quantum computing. Basic advances in all of these areas are needed to bring revolutionary quantum technologies closer to realization.<br/><br/>The strength of the IQI rests on three distinctive qualities: a focus on interdisciplinary research, an emphasis on fostering the career development of world-class postdoctoral talent, and devotion to an active visitor program. The IQI promotes synergistic interactions among scientists with a variety of backgrounds. Physicists and computer scientists collaborate on investigations of quantum algorithms and quantum cryptographic protocols. Control theorists and physicists team up to illuminate the structure of entanglement. Theorists and experimenters join forces to conceive feasible realizations of quantum hardware. The IQI has attracted and trained top postdoctoral scholars, seven of whom have moved on to faculty positions (or the equivalent) elsewhere, thus significantly strengthening the world effort in QIS. The visitor program fuels intellectual excitement, facilitates collaborations and exchanges of scientific ideas, and performs a highly valued service for the international QIS community.<br/><br/>With the end of scalability of conventional silicon-based information technology on the horizon, it is vitally important to explore aggressively new paradigms for information technology. IQI contributions are dedicated to broadening the nation's technical base and ensuring US leadership in the future development of quantum science and technology. <br/><br/>Funding for this award is provided through the Physics at the Information Frontier program in the Physics Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Emerging Models and Technologies for Computation Cluster in the Computing and Communications Foundations Division in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate.

This project is creating a set of instructional spreadsheet modules that connect mathematics to nonmathematical contexts to support the diffusion of Quantitative Literacy throughout the curriculum. Each module addresses a topic in a particular discipline by posing a problem that students must figure out how to solve by applying mathematics. In the process they are also challenged to design and define the spreadsheet calculations that are needed. The intellectual merit of this full development effort includes its grounding in an earlier proof-of-concept project, DUE 0126500, Spreadsheet Exercises in Geological-Mathematical Problem Solving. This initial work sparked interest at the Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education. Now a major partner in this full project, the center is facilitating the engagement of a large community of faculty in creating, editing, curating, and disseminating these modules. Evaluation includes pre- and post-use testing of student learning and attitudes at various institutions together with site visits, focus groups, and in-depth studies of selected students as part of a robust study to determine how problem-solving using such spreadsheet-based modules affects student learning. In promoting Quantitative Literacy, this project is having a broad impact by developing habits of mind in future citizens to engage quantitative material in relevant contexts. Working through a statewide network offers a model that is transportable to other states and regions.

Anthropogenic introduction of reactive N into the biosphere now exceeds natural sources of N to terrestrial ecosystems. This results in substantial negative human and environment health effects. The only process that permanently removes reactive N from the environment is denitrification (reduction, by bacteria, of reactive N to non-reactive N2 gas). Denitrification occurs in almost all terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems, but fragmentation of the science has impeded quantification of this critical process. This project will develop an international coordinated network (RCN) of denitrification scientists from a wide array of disciplines, from molecular biology to ecosystem science, and from soil science to oceanography. Through interdisciplinary exchange it will advance quantification of denitrification, and models to scale-up site specific measurements to ecosystem, regional and global scales. Mechanisms to achieve this include workshops, targeted integrative special sessions at major scientific meetings, and a website with contact information and on-line training. <br/> Broader Impacts: Interdisciplinary education of undergraduate, graduate students and post-docs is an important function of this project. It will contribute knowledge to future management of the global N cycle to meet objectives of both food security and environmental quality. Knowledge will be shared between academic denitrification experts and individuals who are using the denitrification process for practical applications (e.g., wastewater treatment facilities, human engineered wetlands).

It is believed by many that supersymmetry will be discovered at LHC or other experiments in the near future. If so, making contact with Nature will involve understanding string theory with N = 1 supersymmetry. With this amount of supersymmetry, string theory has immensely rich dynamics, which contains many clues into what the fundamental formulation of string theory should be. Yet, the dynamics is constrained enough to be tractable.The PI proposes research which addresses fundamental questions regarding various particular N = 1 string theories, as well as the global space of N = 1 string theories. She will exploit a tool known as ?topological string theory?. This theory is very closely related to the physical string - in fact, it gives the same answers for a large class of questions. Yet, it is simplified enough that progress can me made on otherwise intractable problems. The PI proposes to develop novel topological theories to widen the class of questions that can thus be approached. The PI will also use the topological string as a direct tool for developing a non-perturbative formulation of string theory.

They were created to help stem the tide of persons with mental illness revolving in and out of the criminal justice system. A precondition of all MHCs is that participation is voluntary. However, it is unclear whether the courts ensure that participation decisions are indeed voluntary or view them as a mere formality. The proposed study has three main objectives. The first is to determine the level of awareness of voluntary participation in MHCs among persons enrolled in the courts and the factors that influence level of awareness. The second is to determine the level of understanding of MHC requirements among persons enrolled in the court and the demographic, mental health, and criminal justice characteristics that associate with understanding. The third is to determine whether level of MHC comprehension at entry predicts future success/failure in the court. Our study was designed with three stages. In Phase I, 200 defendants from two cooperating MHCs (one in the Northwest and one in the Northeast) will be interviewed. Interviews will consist of demographic, criminal and mental health history questions as well as the administration of several standardized measures assessing symptomatology, adjudicative competence, insight, and perceived coercion. MHC awareness, understanding, and appreciation will be assessed. In Phase II, outcome data will be collected for a one-year period following the Phase I interview. Outcome data, which will come from objective record reviews, will include success/failure measures such as number of re-arrests, days hospitalized, status review hearings mandated and attended, jail days, and graduation rates. Findings from our study have the potential to help MHCs realize their goals. For example, if MHC comprehension is predictive of success, as theorized, training programs to increase understanding could be developed and incorporated into MHC practices.

Their current and future carbon balance is poorly understood and remains controversial because of large gaps in our understanding of carbon cycling in this biome.  To date relevant studies in these forests have largely been limited to few carbon fluxes that were followed for short periods.  For no topical rain forest has there been a multi-year integrated study of multiple components of both aboveground and belowground carbon cycling and how they interact with and are controlled by water, nutrients, and climatic factors.  This Biocomplexity project will address these knowledge gaps to bring understand of tropical forest carbon cycling to a new level.<br/><br/>We will build on complementary on-going research in an exceptionally well-studied tropical rain forest (La Selva, Costa Rica) for a first-time integrated study of forest carbon, nutrient, and hydrological cycles.  Our study will contrast the effects of different phases of the ENSO cycle and will compare stands across a broad range of soil fertility levels, thus representative of the fertility levels of many of the world's tropical forests.  The broad range of expertise represented in our team - tropical forest ecology, plant ecophysiology, micrometeorology, forest biogeochemistry, forest hydrology, ecosystem modeling, remote sensing, invertebrate biology - will allow us to together address many interacting aspects of the carbon, nutrient, and water cycles in this forest.  With complementary data from on-going studies at La Selva, this project will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the forest carbon budget than has been attained for any TRF.  Because our studies will be continuous through almost three years and for some data sets build on long-term measurements, we will be able to study how inter-year variation in climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall affect the complex interactions and feedbacks among carbon, nutrients, and water in this ecosystem type.  By studying all of these cycles in concert, through time, and across a strong gradient of soil fertility levels, we will be able to identify and quantify the complex constraints and feedbacks among all these co-varying processes.  We will integrate our findings by developing from our data an empirically-based tropical rain forest version of the ecosystem process model CENTURY.  We will use this model to develop a generalizable, predictive understanding of how TRF currently processes carbon, and TRF carbon balance is likely to respond to the on-going changes in climate.<br/><br/>Broader impacts - Through a many-faceted education program, this project will convey both our research findings and the concepts of Biocomplexity, global change, and ecosystem science, to diverse levels of students decision-makers, and the general public.  The research component of this project will provide outstanding opportunities for intensive research training by hands-on participation in interdisciplinary science in the tropics for a postdoctoral fellow, graduate students, numerous undergraduate assistants, and Costa Rican postgraduates and assistants.  The project will be presented in the form of lectures, field problems/walks, and informal interactions to the thousands of undergraduate and graduate students in university-level field biology courses that visit the field site annually.  We have partnered with Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden and the Organization for Tropical Studies with outreach programs that will annually reach thousands of children, students and the general public, both in the U.S. and in Costa Rica.  Public education components of the project target will raise awareness of the school children, their teachers, and the general public to the connectivity of water, carbon and nutrient processes in the tropics and how their effects can extend to the global scale.<br/><br/>

Missouri-Rolla<br/><br/>The main plan for this proposal is to assemble a team of U.S. and Portuguese researchers <br/>that will actively participate in an international workshop to be held in Portugal. This international workshop will focus on establishing research partnerships between U.S. and Portuguese scientists in the field of earthquake engineering research. These research partnerships will be established within the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) collaborative goals, which emphasize shared use and timely access to research data. In particular it is expected that these research partnerships will lead to the formulation of Grand Challenge (GC) NEESR projects among international collaborators. <br/><br/>A new era in earthquake engineering research is upon us. Today the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Research (NEES) is attempting to revolutionize earthquake-engineering research to a more predominant multidisciplinary, multi-institutional and <br/>worldwide collaboration. Under NEES, 16-research equipment sites are currently in the final stages of construction and are geographically distributed around the U.S. An important feature of <br/>these NEES research facilities is the teleobservation and teleoperation capabilities, which allows <br/>researchers at different locations to observe and operate the same physical test at one site. This <br/>feature of teleconferencing can benefit the exchange of information between institutions, while <br/>simultaneously expanding the experimental capability of many research institutions. NEES <br/>equipment portfolio for improving the seismic design and performance of the U.S. civil and <br/>mechanical systems will have a significant impact on education and training of the <br/>next-generation engineers. Under NEES these research facilities will be open to a large number <br/>of researchers for conducting research in the field of earthquake engineering. This without a <br/>doubt will propel the field of earthquake engineering research to new horizons. <br/><br/>The goal for establishing NEES was to provide a national and international resource that <br/>will shift the emphasis of earthquake engineering research from current reliance on physical <br/>testing to integrated experimentation, computation, theory, databases, and model-based <br/>simulation. Over the next 10 years, and starting in 2004, another main goal of the NEES <br/>consortium is to add other research facilities in the US and around the world. In line with this <br/>goal; the main objective of the proposed international workshop is to develop research ties <br/>between researchers from the U.S. and Portugal. Participants in this international workshop will <br/>comprise of U.S. and Portuguese researchers in the field of seismic design of civil infrastructures. <br/>The PI expects to assemble a team of 10 researchers from the U.S. and an equal number from <br/>Portugal.
0453944	Collaborative Research: High Resolution Imaging of Deep Mantle Structure Using USArray Data	EAR	EARTHSCOPE-SCIENCE UTILIZATION	08/01/2005	05/21/2008	Edward Garnero	AZ	Arizona State University	Continuing grant	Gregory J.

The research plan is designed to scale naturally with the progressive deployment of TA stations in the western U.S, building upon initial results obtained using California regional network data. We are analyzing teleseismic earthquake waves that traverse the deep mantle in three subregions: beneath the southern U.S.-Gulf of Mexico-Central America-Caribbean, under the Central Pacific, and beneath Alaska and northern North America. Seismic methodologies that exploit the relatively dense 70-km station spacing provided by the TA data are being applied. Double-array waveform stacking, Kirchhoff scattering migration in 3D tomographic models, shear-wave splitting analysis allowing for azimuthal anisotropy, and finite frequency tomographic arrival time inversion procedures are the primary methods being applied to broadband P and S waveforms. When the initial TA deployment is completed, it will enable 5-fold increase in deep mantle spatial sampling relative to recently developed localized high resolution models for beneath the Cocos Plate and regional framework structures that we have developed. Particular effort is being focused on the mid- and deep mantle beneath Central America and the Gulf of Mexico, where there is evidence in tomographic models for tabular high velocity structures extending through the lower mantle and spreading broadly in the D Region, possibly associated with the Farallon slab and with the long history of subduction beneath North America. The velocity gradients, structural continuity, structural fabric, and spatial extent of the deep mantle structure is being examined using arrival time analysis and migration methods, with 2D and 3D synthetic modeling being used to quantify structures and to verify the reliability of the imaging procedures. Corresponding structure beneath the subduction zone under Alaska is being analyzed, and these two convergent zone regions are being compared to the isolated structure under the Central Pacific. We are assessing contributions to deep mantle structure from slab material, a post-perovskite phase transition, deep mantle dynamic flow, and partial melting. These analyses will be closely coordinated with Earthscope investigations of shallow mantle structure, incorporating corrections based on models found by others for receiver structure, lithospheric anisotropy, and upper mantle travel time variations. Our goal is to exploit USArray data to make breakthrough advances in understanding of deep mantle structure and its relationship to mid- and upper-mantle flow associated with the westward movement of the North American continent.

It is engaged in refining the ASA college-level curriculum and further developing innovative pedagogical materials for a college-level introductory sociology course. A second goal is also being pursued, identification of conditions leading to successful student learning, especially among women and members of racial/ethnic minorities who are underrepresented in social science fields. Particular attention is being paid to developing their abilities to integrate, synthesize, and interpret information and enhancing their literacy and quantitative skills. <br/>The intellectual merit of the project derives from the fact that the new course will result in deeper and more lasting student learning by all types of students. It will increase our knowledge of how underrepresented groups can more successfully learn social science concepts and methods. <br/>Significant broader impacts will be realized ultimately from the widespread adoption of this new national model for a college-level introductory sociology course. The following course features are contributing to the broader impacts: a greatly strengthened curricular content, increased reliance on inquiry-based teaching resources, significant student experience in using major national datasets and tools, and formative feedback from companion assessment materials. Further, as an outgrowth of this projects' linking of practicing sociologists, junior college, college, and university faculty (and high school teachers), the project is developing new networks to enhance teacher training and student involvement in research. <br/><br/>The project evaluation is employing field observations of classes, videotapes of classes, interviews of teachers and students, analysis of the content of student assessment materials, and students' performances on the new assessments. Assessment of these collected data is providing the basis for a further round of modifications of the curriculum, teaching resources, and assessment tools. The project website and discussion board is permitting sociology instructors to share questions, problems, strategies, and materials.<br/>By project completion there will be a well-refined curriculum, a set of teaching materials that are aligned with it, and systematic assessment of how they work. These will be shared at professional associations of sociologists, educational researchers, and high school teachers, in professional and general public publications, and made available through the American Sociological Association.

Meng, SUNY Binghamton and 0414939, C. Yu, UIC) is to develop technologies for providing integrated access to Web databases. The approach consists of developing highly automated solutions to the following tasks: discovering Web databases from the Web, clustering them according to their application domains, integrating the search interfaces of the Web databases in the same domain into an integrated search interface, mapping each query submitted to an integrated interface to its underlying Web databases, extracting and annotating the search result records from the result pages returned from the local Web databases, and merging the results to form an integrated response for presentation to the user. Web services based interfaces of Web databases, if available, will be utilized. The evaluation of the developed algorithms is based on real Web databases from different domains. This research is expected to produce new algorithms, useful datasets, a software toolkit, and several operational Web database metasearch engines (including some for the Air Force Research Lab at Rome). The developed technology can be used in many applications including comparison shopping and collecting data from the deep Web. Research results will be incorporated into several courses the PIs teach and students will be recruited to participate in the research activities.

This research will generate the commercially viable conditions for growth of large boules of single crystals suitable for use in diode pumped solid-state lasers. The hydrothermal method is a low temperature growth technique that leads to crystals containing less thermal strain, much fewer defects and greater homogeneity than conventional methods. These defects combine to cause considerable optical loss and concomitant reduction in performance. The hydrothermal technique has slower growth kinetics and requires chemical development for economically viable growth. In the Phase I project, preliminary growth conditions that lead to suitable single crystals were identified. These conditions include approximate thermal ranges, a variety of starting materials, seed crystals and mineralizer concentrations. In the Phase II project growth conditions will be systematically optimized to provide suitable transport rates and crystal quality. Once an acceptable growth is developed, the resulting boules will be evaluated for performance efficiency and loss. <br/><br/>Commercially benefits will emerge as the company introduces new higher performance crystal materials to the market that cannot be grown by existing crystal growth methods. In addition, new laser materials will be donated to Clemson University for design of new laser devices and cavities supporting the University's participation in the emerging photonics Coalition of the Carolinas that includes Clemson, the OptoElectronics Center at UNC-Charlotte, COMSET at Clemson University, and the Carolina MicroOptics Consortium.

The knowledge-sharing hub proposed in the project has the ability to use disparate computational resources to reliably exchange data and computations with little intervention from the user. A second challenge is to develop methods that answer the researchers' hybrid queries, which are combinations of scientific expertise and algorithms that detect and retrieve information related by image features, semantic description, map location, and patterns of DNA sequences, even when those data are not currently correlated with each other in the partner's databases. The proposed hybrid query system will be the first and only in the research community that allows a researcher or an educator to submit an image of a mutant to the database and ask, What genes or environmental factors cause this visual phenotype? The [roject includes an educational component with two unique aspects: One focus is on training of undergraduate and graduate students and creating courses for them that are closely aligned with the research activities. The new courses, titled Content Management in Bioinformatics, and Computer Vision and Image Understanding in Bioinformatics will be pioneering courses in computational biology curriculum design. The other focus will leverage the proposed research activities to create, in conjunction with traditional computer science courseware, scientific data repositories for computation and biology education.

Particular attention is paid to the unification of quantum theory and general relativity, two cornerstones of 20th century physics. This unification, on one hand, seems to involve a beautiful mathematical structure hidden in its underlying theoretical framework. Understanding the underlying new hidden symmetries will enhance our understanding of how the fundamental physical laws are in action. On the other hand, it requires modifications of the geometry, that we have been familiar with in Einstein's theory of gravitation, at very small distances. We begin to attack the problems of how spacetime fabrics give rise to the observed Universe, of what is the origin of the mysterious dark energy that drives our Universe to an accelerated expansion etc. These modifications, if theoretically identified and observationally verified, will greatly change our world picture in a profound way. All these should help us to understand better the recent astrophysical and cosmological observations with high precision, that have begun to provide us detailed information about the origin of our Cosmos, its past, its present and its future as well.

Objectives have been defined to investigate the determinants of initial and longitudinal outcomes, as well as to compare Kaizen events with a more traditional improvement mechanism (continuous process improvement teams). Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies (surveys, operational performance data, observations, document reviews, and interviews) will be used to collect data from eight manufacturers over a three-year period. We explicitly including both social and technical system outcomes and will empirically test claims that Kaizen event use will lead to the creation of a culture of continual improvement over time.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Research results will be shared with the collaborating organizations and industrial consortiums will be used to disseminate the results to a broader industrial and research community. Members of these consortiums will be able to use the research findings to design better Kaizen events, with a higher probability of successfully sustaining outcomes. Also, the research will be integrated into engineering curricula of both undergraduate and graduate courses at Oregon State University and Virginia Tech. Both PI's are actively teaching engineering courses in which lean practices and change mechanisms are explicitly covered.

Extremely hot or<br/>dense objects which are made of nuclear matter exist in the cosmos;<br/>however, without the possibility direct study of the interiors of neutron <br/>stars, or of the first moments of a supernova, or of the earliest moments <br/>of the Big Bang, one resorts to the challenging studies of finite and <br/>transient systems as provided by nucleus-nucleus collisions.

Do rocks deform in the ductile regime by diffusion creep (with strain rate proportional to stress), or by dislocation creep (where doubling the stress increases strain rates ~10 times)?. Is the lower crust relatively strong, with efficient coupling of strain between the crust and mantle, or weak, as in the classic jelly sandwich model? Is the upper mantle strong, as expected for dry peridotite, or weak, due to high volatile content? Is deformation in the upper mantle localized along shear zones beneath crustal faults, or distributed, as in thin viscous sheet models?<br/><br/>This is a project that will use seismic anisotropy to measure strain in the mantle and that when combined with mineral physics, to constrain deformation mechanisms and therefore to constrain rheology. The PIs maintain that the strike-slip system in New Zealand is the best place to study these relationships because the signal is large and simple with constraints at the surface provided by geology, GPS, and known relative plate motions for the last 45 million years. Specifically the project involves: 1) Deployment of 30 Ocean Bottom Seismographs; 2) Measurement of seismic anisotropy using a variety of techniques (shear-wave splitting, surface wave dispersion, Pn and Sn travel times, and receiver functions); 3) Calculations of mantle finite strain fields that might be responsible for anisotropy, constrained by relative plate motions and observed strain in New Zealand and considering a variety of vertical and lateral distributions of temperature and deformation mechanisms; and 4) Combination of laboratory, theoretical and seismological constraints on anisotropy to bound the conditions under which dislocation creep occurs.

Culler<br/>Institution: University of California-Berkeley <br/>Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research Infrastructure<br/>Title: CRI:Scalable Embedded Wireless Sensor Network Evaluation Facility<br/><br/>Investigators at UC Berkeley will build an inter-related family of flexible, large-scale evaluation facilities for wireless embedded sensor networks that will enable empirical evaluation of critical protocols at a scale and completeness that is not possible today. This will allow rigorous testing of protocols and distributed data processing algorithms under real conditions of noise, interference, loss, and variations in connectivity that are extremely difficult to capture accurately under simulation. They will build an indoor, large-scale set of over a thousand heterogeneous wireless nodes with extensive logging capabilities. The testbed will utilize the newest generation of Berkeley motes, redesigned for these testbeds, as well as newly developed, embedded Linux-class nodes. This will be complemented with a dedicated server side infrastructure to schedule experiments, operate nodes, store and analyze the experimental data, and emulate enterprise capabilities that interact with sensor networks. Traces of sensor data streams will also be stored in the infrastructure and replayed into the wireless network to allow repeatable experimentation with realistic in-network data processing algorithms. In addition to the sheer number of nodes, the facility will stress the heterogeneity likely to be encountered in practical deployments by including higher-powered nodes, higher bandwidth networks, and mobile motes. <br/><br/>The infrastructure will enable research in Wireless Sensor Networks which represent a very new and important class of networked systems. Issues to be addressed include routing, information dissemination techniques, energy efficient communication protocols and reliable communication with intermittent connectivity, the use of vision and high bandwidth sensors, mobile and high power nodes in heterogeneous WSN, and networked information theory. Finally, approaches to security in WSN such as analysis of key pre-distribution protocols, secure routing, secure aggregation and privacy research will be highlighted on the testbed. In addition to supporting about 25 researchers at Berkeley, the testbed network will become available to the broader research community through Internet login or on-site visits. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts of the project include exploring technology for eventual deployment of a new information infrastructure to a large number of critical physical infrastructures, including electric power, heating and cooling of buildings, water, oil and gas pipelines, refineries, etc. This project will examine high confidence services: reliable, fault tolerant and resistant to attack. These same capabilities represent a potential breakthrough for many areas of science, including environmental monitoring, civil engineering, eco-physiology and others.

The aim of this research is a better understanding of the properties of macroscopic systems originating in the collective behavior of their microscopic constituents. The emphasis is on non-equilibrium systems and the methods used range from rigorous mathematical analysis to computer simulations. We are particularly interested in bridging the gap between rigorous results and applications.<br/>Intellectual Merit includes: 1) An extension of Boltzmann's entropy and H-theorem to systems not in local thermal equilibrium. It is proposed to generalize recent work for dense fluids to more complex systems, including nano and biological ones, where entropic considerations play an important role. This will require an appropriate generalization of Boltzmann's entropy to non-equilibrium quantum systems.<br/>2) Recently-obtained exact large deviation functions, describing fluctuations in stationary<br/>non-equilibrium states of model systems are of an unexpected form. Their most striking feature, non-locality on the macroscopic scale, can be traced to the long-range correlations, measurable experimentally by neutron scattering, which exist in such systems. Extension and application of these results to more realistic systems is planned.<br/>3) For open quantum systems, such as current-carrying nano-wires, the classical modeling of the reservoirs by stochastic interactions is problematic. The usual approach is to use free fields, or ideal gases, as reservoirs. This is unsatisfactory in many cases and we plan to continue our investigation of alternative approaches such as the use of strongly coupled systems, represented by random matrices, as reservoirs.<br/>4) Techniques we developed for dealing with the response of quantum systems to strong time dependent external fields have yielded rigorous results about simple model systems. Applications to the optimal control of quantum transitions in molecules and to external fields in solids are planned. 5) We have obtained novel results about the structure of systems with reduced particle number fluctuations. These have applications to cosmology and to queuing theory, which will be explored further. 6) An important question in developing approximation schemes for fluids is the possibility of constructing particle distributions having specified densities and pair correlations. This can be achieved in some cases by the explicit construction of point processes via determinants and renewals. General existence criteria are being investigated. 7) We have applied statistical mechanical methods to the mathematical study of epidemics taking into account correlations as well as saturation effects on networks. New macroscopic equations for the description of the evolution and prevalence of an endemic infected state improve agreement with more detailed microscopic models. Extension of these techniques to models of population dynamics and ecology is planned.<br/>Broader Impact: The proposed research is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together physicists, mathematicians, chemists and those working in theoretical areas of the biological and social sciences. The expected applications are in material science, complex fluids and biological and social systems. Our program also includes the organization of two conferences every year in which both core subjects and new<br/>developments in statistical mechanics are discussed in a collegial atmosphere. Graduate students, postdocs and minority scientists are encouraged to present talks on their work and interact with leaders in the field. The conferences also serve as a clearing house for positions and often lead to new collaborations.

Since the GW-induced motion is extremely small, quantum mechanical noise on the laser light can pose a serious limitation to the detector sensitivity. This quantum noise arises from two effects: (i) uncertainty in the number of photons at the interferometer output due to quantum mechanical fluctuations (known as shot noise); and (ii) light pressure which exerts forces that move the mirrors of the interferometer (known as radiation pressure noise or back action noise). The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle sets a minimum for the product of the shot noise and back action noise, but it also allows the minimum shot noise to be lowered below the standard level, provided the back action noise is increased, or vice versa. This process is sometimes called squeezing because the noise from one process is squeezed into the other. For example, previous experiments have shown how laser light can be squeezed by making its amplitude fluctuations small, but giving greater uncertainty in its phase.<br/><br/>Experiments will be carried out to generate and study squeezed states of light that are suitable for injection into a gravitational-wave interferometer. The effort will concentrate on the aspects of squeezed light most important for improving the sensitivity of future GW interferometers: vacuum squeezing at lower frequencies than have previously been explored. Two methods are being developed in parallel: (i) use of nonlinear optical media, such as crystals of lithium niobate, where<br/>the output light is squeezed due to correlations created by interaction of light beams in the crystal; and (ii) use of the coupling between the motion of a low-mass mechanical oscillator and intense laser light, which causes the light to be squeezed because the motion of the oscillator induced by forces due to amplitude fluctuations of the light couples to the phase of the light. The goal with both these experiments is to yield up to 6 dB of vacuum squeezing at a few hundred Hertz. In addition to improved sensitivity for gravitational wave detectors, the long-term technical advances necessary to achieve this goal will have applications in quantum optics, quantum information, (sub-)nanoscale mechanical systems and precision measurement.

Quiescence or G0 is the most common state of cells on earth and was surely one of the first states in the evolution of living cells. Paradoxically, this fundamentally important process has not been well studied, but the advent of genomics and the development of ancillary technologies have recently enabled significant progress in understanding this state.<br/><br/>Leading up to the current project, this research group has studied the changes in gene expression as cells in stationary-phase cultures re-enter the mitotic cell cycle. They identified over 30 new genes required for long-term survival of cells in stationary-phase cultures. They recently developed a method that allows separation of quiescent and non-quiescent cells in stationary-phase cultures and developed a rapid sampler that allows them to reproducibly harvest cells in culture for genomic analysis at intervals as short as 10s. <br/><br/>The group will now characterize quiescent and non-quiescent yeast cells from stationary-phase yeast cultures. GFP constructs and electron microscopy will be used to detect morphological differences between cell types. Various biochemical and genomic analyses will be carried out on both cell types as a function of time in culture. The non-quiescent cells will be evaluated using several assays to determine the percentage of cells that exhibit apoptotic or senescent characteristics. As necessary, modified separation methods will be used to increase the purity of populations from the non-quiescent-cell fraction.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the work comes from the novel insight provided by being able to study, for the first time, pure populations of quiescent and non-quiescent cells and through the identification of genes and pathways critical for the differentiation of these cell types. This work has broad relevance, since, based on previous work with yeast, these differentiation processes are likely to be conserved in other microbes and eukaryotic organisms. The broader impacts of this work are in the involvement of students and faculty from underrepresented groups, the breadth of collaborations between biologists, statisticians and engineers, the commitment to the free distribution of newly developed technology, and sharing genomic reagents.
0455995	Robust Technologies for Automated Ingestion and Long-Term Preservation of Digital Information	IIS	DIGITAL GOVERNMENT, 	07/15/2005	07/13/2005	Joseph Ja'Ja'	MD	University of Maryland College Park	Standard Grant	Lawrence Brandt	06/30/2007	$490,157.00	Douglas Oard, Allison Druin	joseph@umiacs.umd.edu	3112 LEE BLDG 7809 Regents Drive	COLLEGE PARK	MD	207425141	3014056269	CSE	1706, V753	1706, 9216, HPCC	$0.00	Thisi project will develop novel tools and technologies for automated ingestion and management of preservation processes, and demonstrate their use on scientific, historical, and educational collections covering widely different technical requirements. The technologies will be built on a novel robust, reliable, and secure layered architecture - ADAPT (Approach to Digital Archiving and Preservation Technology) - developed by the research group using open standards and web technologies. This architecture will evolve gracefully as the underlying technologies change and will interoperate with digital library and grid technologies. Specifically, The team will develop a distributed persistent archive that provides producers, site administrators, and preservation managers key functionalities for the long-term access and preservation of digital assets. A novel architecture for a deep archive, with provably high reliability and high resiliency against security attacks and system failures, will also be demonstrated. The tools and technologies will be tested and validated on four very distinct and rich collections: (i) an archive of videotaped oral histories provided by the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation; (ii) children's books in their original languages (current over 500 books in 30 languages) available through the University of Maryland International Children.s Digital Library (ICDL); (iii) a rich historical collection of photographs, drawings, maps, charts and textual documents available through the National Archives' Electronic Access Project (EAP); and (iv) a wide variety of unique earth science data available through the University of Maryland Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF).<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. A large portion of the scientific, business, cultural, and government digital information being created today needs to be maintained and preserved for future use of periods ranging from a few years to decades and sometimes centuries. This project introduces a novel framework for planning, managing, and executing ingestion and preservation processes. Novel features include: (i) an automated distributed ingestion architecture that enables secure and verifiable ingestion of digital objects; (ii) a policy driven management of preservation processes with the ability to constantly audit secure replication, refreshing, and migration, and track media degradation, file corruption, and format obsolescence; (iii) a peer-to-peer architecture for a deep archive, which guarantees with high probability the integrity and survivability of every object in<br/>the deep archive against failures and malicious corruption; and (iv) an evaluation strategy to assess various strategies developed under this project. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. Many communities are interested in long term preservation of their data, and are seeking technology approaches to deal with this challenging problem. This project will address issues of direct interest to all these communities. The research team will introduce technologies and tools to these communities through presentations at major related meetings. Moreover, this project involves collaborations with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), NASA at Goddard, and the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation. An impact on these three organizations will in fact have a much broader impact on many other communities. Strong letters of support from these three organizations are appended to this proposal. Various tools will be developed and released as well-documented open source software.

The initiative represents a unified effort between the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC), the Steel Founder's Society of America (SFSA) and researchers at the University of Arizona (UA). A task group, Steel Founders / Steel Construction (SF/SC), has been organized to spearhead this effort. In addition to the AISC and SFSA staff listed above as co-PIs, the SF/SC is comprised of SFSA foundry members, AISC fabricator members, and practicing structural design engineers. SF/SC has been meeting since early 2002 to initiate discussion on areas of common interest. The activity will involve identifying structural steel applications where modular construction can: (1) improve economy and/or reliability of a component; (2) eliminate difficult or costly fabrication and/or difficult or dangerous erection; and, (3) permit the use of steel construction in situations previously unexplored for practical reasons. Cast modular components will be conceived, including more efficient details/sections and altogether new forms, with an emphasis on economy, constructability, and meeting architectural need. Alpha prototypes for these forms will be developed through extensive parametric studies used to evaluate geometry, material or develop special features. These parametric studies will be analytical in nature: structural performance will be evaluated through finite element solid modeling while castability will be evaluated through solidification modeling. Optimal shapes will be obtained through an iterative procedure involving electronic exchange of solid model data between the structural analysis team at UA and the casting analysis team at SFSA. Once designs have been optimized, the SFSA team will cast full-scale physical prototypes. Using the appropriate surrounding steel members, the AISC team will fabricate the prototypes into structural assemblages. These steps also allow the SFSA and AISC teams to evaluate manufacturing issues related to the ease, integrity and economy of the casting and fabrication processes. The prototypes will be tested in the full-scale reaction frame at the UA Integrated Computation and Experimentation Laboratory (ICEL). These verification tests will be used to qualify a detail or identify further challenges in structural performance to be addressed in a beta prototype. This approach to the development of cast modular forms has been used with great success by the PI in his NSF CAREER Research. Following successful verification testing of a prototype, the AISC team will identify appropriate implementation sites and the erection issues will be evaluated. The team's strong presence in the construction rich Chicago-land area will facilitate this final step in the proof of concept. Each development process will conclude with a comprehensive economic analysis; prequalification/codification, and outreach/marketing efforts by the SF/SC. Industry involvement will involve both the parent organizations AISC and SFSA and several of their industry members. AISC, SFSA and their members will contribute time and cost sharing including: in-kind funds, donations of material and labor costs associated with the creation of specimens for the experimental program; engineering in terms of conception and development of the prototypes; expertise in performing comprehensive economic evaluations and feasibility studies; technology transfer activities including qualification, code development, marketing and outreach. The monetary value of the first two items alone: in-kind funds (estimated @ $6K/yr per industry organization) and donation of material and labor for specimens (also $6K/yr per ind. org.) will not be less than $72,000 for the 3-year duration of the project. The significant engineering efforts associated with this activity will place the industry contribution at $168,000. <br/>Intellectual Merit. The project will advance knowledge within the field of steel construction in better understanding force flow between components; and across fields by exchange of approaches, knowledge base, and technology. The project explores a creative approach to building, manufacturing and design of steel structures. To accomplish these goals, the project will advance the state-of-the-art in integrating manufacturing with analytical simulation, and this integration will be accomplished between academia and industry. <br/>Broader Impact: The project will directly impact two key domestic industries: the steel construction industry and the steel casting industry, and develop partnerships among them. Industry interest is evidenced by the participation of the two representative institutes, AISC and SFSA, including the formation of a joint industry committee and financial support as indicated above. The project results, when realized, will result in new efficient, safer and economical connection designs and move the steel construction industry toward modular construction. The project will support 2 graduate students, who will be educated through research and interactions with industry practitioners. Research results will be disseminated directly to industry practitioners.

These opportunities have arisen from two sources: (1) the completion and upcoming commissioning of a magnetic chicane compressor built at UCLA for the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at BNL; and (2) the restart of the Visible to Infrared SASE Amplifier (VISA) self-amplified spontaneous emission free electron laser (SASE FEL) at the ATF. The proposed experimental program will allow this collaboration to investigate the physics of ultra-short electron beam production using chicane compression, and the generation of sub-picosecond (ps) radiation pulses from the SASE FEL process. These topics are at the frontier of beam physics today, and provide a rich context for university-based scholarly research. <br/><br/>The proposed investigations are critical to the current development of 4th generation X-ray light sources which utilize SASE FELs, such as those at Stanford and DESY (Hamburg). In addition, they also impact high average power FELs, energy recovery linac (ERL) based light source systems, high energy physics linear colliders, and advanced (laser and plasma based) accelerators. <br/><br/>These investigations are of critical importance to the development of the X-ray SASE FEL as the physical systems under test are shared: high brightness electron injector, sub-ps compressor, dogleg transport, and highly optimized undulator. The development of this comprehensive approach to address more sophisticated issues in high brightness beam-based radiation production will significantly aid in laying the scientific basis for the X-ray SASE FEL and other cutting edge accelerator systems.

Efforts on land to determine the frequency of such earthquake and their magnitudes and rupture lengths have been hampered by few suitable localities where a geologic record has been created. Offshore, new core data show that continental margin channels in Northern California have recorded a Holocene history of regional submarine landslides possibly triggered by San Andreas great earthquakes. This project is applying marine paleoseismologic techniques to the turbidite history along the Northern San Andreas transform margin using cores collected in 2002 during a cruise of the Scripps vessel R/V Roger Revelle.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to test models of full margin and segmented rupture along the North Coast segment of the San Andreas Fault. A Holocene event chronology along the margin from San Francisco to Cape Mendocino is being established using offshore turbidites and turbidite events are being tested for synchronous (and therefore earthquake) triggering. The methods include direct dating of each turbidite, biostratigraphy, and direct physical property correlation using density, magnetics, mineralogy and visible and X-ray imagery to construct a stratigraphic framework along the margin.<br/><br/>Correlation of events between separate sites along the fault using radiocarbon, and fingerprints of each event are being used to test the linkages between deposits along the fault. Direct linkages point to an earthquake origin, since other triggers of submarine landslides happen in only one canyon at a time. Using this information, it may be possible to establish both rupture length and timing of past earthquakes along the Northern San Andreas. This information will be valuable for analysis of seismic hazards in San Francisco, as well as shed light on the long-term behavior of large fault systems that does not presently exist.

For that reason and because the<br/>understanding of nuclei has a broad range of application, including<br/>Cosmology and Astrophysics, the physics of exotic rare isotopes has become<br/>one of the top research priorities both in the U.S. and worldwide.<br/><br/>In order to accompany the present development of new rare-isotopes<br/>accelerators around the world, the goal of the present theoretical project<br/>is to develop a fully microscopic model of medium to heavy-mass nuclei. It<br/>is quite urgent to realize such a long-term goal of nuclear structure since<br/>current best many-body methods are hardly predictive when applied to unknown<br/>medium-mass isotopes with a large excess of neutrons. Among several<br/>important features of the project, our goal is to achieve a better<br/>understanding of the modifications brought about by the presence of a<br/>neutron-rich environment to the nucleon-nucleon interaction. This is a key<br/>element to describe accurately medium-mass neutron-rich nuclei which are of<br/>prime interest to unreveal nucleo-synthesis scenarii in the universe.

The investigator will apply both geological and glaciological techniques to reconstruct the last 2000 years of ice surface elevation changes in the Ford Ranges, Antarctica, merging the existing geological information and data from a new glaciological study into a more complete picture of ice sheet change from the Holocene to the present. Geomorphic mapping will establish which parts of the ice margin are stable or actively retreating, and expand the existing set of exposure ages to include very recently deglaciated surfaces. The glaciology of the fringing ice fields that separate most exposure-dating sites from the major trunk glaciers will also be investigated. The result will be a better understanding of how to connect exposure age dates to past changes in important glaciological parameters, and a comprehensive history of Holocene to present ice surface elevation changes. The investigator is knowledgeable in the relevant glacial geology and cosmogenic-nuclide geochemistry, but has limited expertise in glaciology. This project is designed to better equip him to work on interdisciplinary questions in antarctic research through training in glaciology, and developing an ability to plan and lead antarctic fieldwork.

CNT is a unique and simple toroidal magnetic confinement device that is specifically designed for the studies proposed here. It will, for the first time, allow a systematic study of plasmas with arbitrary degree of neutrality, from pure electron to quasi-neutral, a systematic study of toroidal magnetic confinement in the presence of extreme electric fields and strong flows, and the creation of the first ever laboratory electron-positron plasma. Electron-positron plasmas are unique in that the mass ratio between the two species is one and the charge ratio is one. Hence, these plasmas are highly symmetric and very different from regular ion-electron plasmas. As a result, electron-positron plasmas have unique properties, such as not supporting acoustic waves and electrostatic drift waves. At the same time, they can be analyzed numerically and analytically more easily than ion-electron plasmas, because both species evolve on the same spatial and temporal scales. Electron-positron plasmas may be considered the hydrogen atom of plasma physics, the simplest possible plasmas. <br/><br/>CNT is a state of the art University experiment, with a large degree of involvement of graduate and undergraduate students. It is an ideal training ground for future experimental scientists. It also facilitates interaction and collaboration with high school science teachers and students, a collaboration that will be further expanded in the future.

It has four primary<br/>research objectives: (1) develop improved methods for analyzing migration decisions of individuals participating in mixed subsistence and cash economies; (2) apply these methods to improve understanding of<br/>Inuit migration decisions in a comparative multi-decadal study of Alaska and arctic Canada; (3) develop and make available to other researchers metadata for research and policy applications; and (4) involve arctic local governments in policy-relevant research.<br/><br/>The PIs address questions about the causes and consequences of migration such as the roles of subsistence opportunities and community quality of life amenities, gender differences, and national policies on migration decisions. Comparing the Inupiat regions in Alaska to the Nunavut Territory of Canada, the researchers ask whether Canadian Inuit are less mobile than Alaska Inupiat; and if so, to what extent can this be attributed to differences in policies in the two nations? They also investigate the long-term consequences of migration decisions: is mobility on balance improving living conditions in arctic communities, especially the poorest places, or is it draining leadership to larger settlements and exacerbating inequalities?<br/><br/>Working with local participating organizations, the researchers are developing research protocols for analyzing microdata collected from the late 1970s to the present, including the US Census, the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic, North Slope Borough Censuses, Statistics Canada's Aboriginal People's Survey, and other household survey data from Nunavut and Alaska. A key step in the research is the creation of a new large-sample household-level dataset from 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census Long Form data, in cooperation with the US Census Center for Economic Studies.

Similarity searches in NDDSs are becoming increasingly important for applications based on multidimensional discrete vectors, such as genome sequence databases, biometrics and E-commerce. Efficient similarity searches require robust indexing techniques in order to provide fast access to data. The currently existing indexing methods are either not suitable for an NDDS (e.g., the R*-tree) or too generic to provide good performance for an NDDS (e.g., metric trees). The main goal of this project is to study the fundamental properties of NDDSs and develop indexing methods exploiting these properties to support efficient similarity searches in NDDSs. A set of essential geometric concepts for an NDDS is introduced based on extended methods for traditional (ordered) continuous data spaces. A number of promising data-partitioning-based and space-partitioning-based indexing techniques (including index tree structures, building strategies, search algorithms and performance models) using these concepts for NDDSs are explored and compared. Other related issues including supporting various types of queries, adopting different distance measures, indexing hybrid data spaces with mixed ordered and non-ordered dimensions, developing efficient bulk loading techniques and utilizing effective compression schemes are studied. This research will provide new database indexing techniques to solve relevant issues in scientific, medical and commerce fields that require fast access to large volumes of NDDS data. Research results, including software tools or programs and experimental data will be disseminated via the projects' Web sites (http://www.cse.msu/~pramanik/nsf05/nsf05msu.html and <br/>http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/~qzhu/nsf05/nsf05umd.html).

Ten years ago it was difficult to measure the erosion rate of a landscape over a timescale relevant to geomorphology; few measurements existed, and these were often unreliable. Today, basin-wide erosion rates can be measured with cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al, almost routinely, by measuring their concentrations in stream sediment. The initial success of these studies portends an immense growth in the application of cosmogenic nuclides. The measurement of cosmogenic radionuclides is accomplished using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). AMS is an increasingly important tool that is applied to a variety of research problems spanning numerous earth science disciplines. The unique strength of AMS is its ability to measure isotopes of an element in which the abundance ratios range from 10-12 to <10-15. The nuclides most commonly measured by AMS include 10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl, and 129I. These and other radionuclides are produced in a variety of geologic settings; their concentrations can serve as chronometers or tracers of naturally-occurring processes. As demand in the NSF scientific community for AMS measurements increases PRIME Lab must be able to meet this demand and assume leadership in both measurement capabilities and scientific applications. PRIME Lab's ultimate goal is to be the focus point for the measurement and application of AMS radionuclides in Earth sciences in the U.S. During the last several years numerous upgrades have been completed. These enhancements are enabling higher precision and faster measurements. During the next four years we anticipate both improvements in existing measurement capabilities and the development of new capabilities. These developments in AMS technology will proceed in parallel with new application of cosmogenic nuclides in the Earth sciences.

The network will focus on how natural and human-caused variation in water supply affects the biotas and landscapes of the Colorado River delta in the United States and Mexico. Participants are from research institutions, universities, community colleges, government agencies and NGOs in both countries. The grant will support workshops, exchange visits, and a bilingual website that provides access to key literature.<br/>The landscapes and biotas of the Colorado River delta, once regulated by natural fluctuations in the river's flow, have now passed into the control of human society. The Colorado River delta is thus a microcosm for the transformation of the Earth's surface for human needs. Network activities will improve the scientific basis of water and environmental policy in this rapidly growing region. Broader impacts also include improved collaboration and coordination of research efforts among disciplines, between U.S. and Mexican scientists, and among academic, agency, and NGO scientists. Opportunities for under-represented minorities will be enhanced through the participation of community college students.
0445267	Effects of Mulitple Species Invasions: Albizia Tree and Coqui Frog Colonization of Hawaii	DEB	ECOSYSTEM STUDIES, POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG, EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES	07/15/2005	07/06/2005	William Mautz	HI	University of Hawaii at Hilo	Standard Grant	Matthew Kane	06/30/2009	$300,000.00	Rebecca Ostertag, Paul Klawinski	mautz@hawaii.edu	200 West Kawili Street	Hilo	HI	967204091	8089567800	BIO	1181, 1182, 9150	1128, 1181, 9150, 9169, EGCH	$0.00	Non-native species are considered invasive when they grow and spread rapidly in their new location. A single species invasion may affect food webs (the structural links of predators and prey) and ultimately the flow of energy and cycling of nutrients from vegetation producers through animal consumers. When multiple species invade an ecosystem, these effects may be magnified. On isolated islands, such as the Hawaiian Islands where numerous species are both unique and have limited geographic range, the probability of extinction in the face of invasions is greatly increased. The recent introduction to Hawaii of high-density populations of the Puerto Rican coqui tree frog is a special opportunity to study the destabilizing potential of invasions and interactions between invasive species. Actively expanding frog populations are layered onto an older but yet ongoing invasion of a forest type dominated by an Asian tree, albizia. Albizia dominated forest is replacing native Hawaiian ohia tree dominated forest at low elevations. The frogs are small but achieve populations up to 2 frogs per square yard in albizia forest. They represent insertion of a new top predator that may exert control on forest arthropods, like insects, spiders, millipedes, etc., that consume plants (herbivores), prey on each other, and decompose leaf litter (detritivores). We will measure the effects of coqui frogs on albizia-dominated and ohia-dominated forest types by comparing arthropod communities, litter decomposition, and soil nutrients between these two forest types at sites with and without frogs present. We expect to discover the extent to and the means by which the albizia tree invasion and the coqui frog invasion disrupts the food web of the lowland Hawaiian forest. We may also discover aspects of the frog's invasive biology that could prove useful for controlling this recognized pest species in Hawaii including possible regulation of the albizia tree invasion.

Electron microscopy (EM) occupies a unique position in the biological armamentarium in that it can address questions at the molecular and cellular level that are unapproachable by other structural methods. EM can bridge light microscopic studies at subcellular resolutions with atomic resolution structures provided by X-ray crystallography and NMR. Recent, technical breakthroughs enable 3D structures to be determined with ever increasing accuracy thereby opening the way to the study of macromolecular systems under defined physiological conditions. The result is new opportunities for understanding biological mechanisms, interactions between macromolecules and the principles of biomolecular design.<br/><br/>The 2005 Conference is organized around the theme of Whither EM? - looking forward to envision how to move from mainly gathering structural information to improving understanding of biological mechanisms and function. The goal is to create a dynamic forum for (i) the dissemination of major progress in the field over the past two years and (ii) identification of new technical and biological challenges which must be addressed in order for 3D EM to become an essential and ubiquitous tool for solving cell biological problems. In the spirit of the Gordon Conference, a program has been chosen that represents the frontier of the field. Speakers have been chosen based on the importance of their recent contributions and the potential impact of their particular research approach. Speakers from outside the field have been selected in the hope of fostering interdisciplinary approaches and for challenging the field to reach in directions it has so far not contemplated. Based on past experience, it is confidently expected that the 3D EM Gordon Conference will continue to play a central role in defining new technical challenges, and in focusing a concerted approach to understanding fundamental biological questions. The impact of the conference will be the improved abilities of the participants and their colleagues to carry out their current projects on subjects of importance in basic biology and medicine, and the inspiration to develop new directions that take advantage of new knowledge and capabilites in advancing these fields. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This series of conferences fosters an integrated view of biological complexity by bringing together scientists working at different levels of the structural hierarchy. These meetings serve to define the challenges of the future and to focus a concerted approach to problems in the preparation, imaging and interpretation of biological specimens that range in size from the molecular to the subcellular. The impact of the preceding ten conferences has been such that the 3D EM community has come to regard this Gordon Conference as an event of pivotal importance. Thus the intellectual merit of the activity lies in the sharing of information on latest results and technological developments among participants. There are very few opportunities for organized training in this type of work. The 3DEM GRC is the largest gathering of people at the cutting edge of molecular and three-dimensional microscopy in terms of the number of attendees and the length of the conference. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The broader impact of the 3DEM GRC is far reaching, as attendees return to their labs with new insights on how EM can be better used to address a wide range of problems in molecular and subcellular structure. The Conference provides one of the primary venues for introducing modern biological electron microsocpy to new users and disseminating the very latest advances to the community. It is thus unique in the amount of information shared, the training it provides to those new to the field, and the intellectual support it provides to even the most established labs. It is also a forum for presenting and discussing the insights and implications derived from the basic technology that it helps to foster.

The objectives will be to refine the seismic stratigraphy around the volcano and relate it to sedimentary processes, identify current depositional and erosional processes on the flank of Santorini and adjacent basins, search for the formation of mineral deposits in the submarine caldera, attempt to identify the Minoan coast line and configuration of the island prior to the 1628 BC eruption and caldera collapse, sample volcanic products of Kolumbo submarine volcano and examine the growth processes of Kolumbo. The work will be conducted as a 7-day add-on to a survey cruise already planned in the area between Crete and Santorini by Dr. Robert Ballard of the University of Rhode Island. The study involves a number of important broader impacts including education (although graduate student time is limited), volcanic hazards, international cooperation, involvement with the Jason Program of Ballard, and others.
0409835	Collaborative Research: Constraining Mantle Rheology, Mantle Flow, and Crust/Mantle coupling Beneath New Zealand	EAR	EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES, CONTINENTAL DYNAMICS PROGRAM	07/01/2005	09/11/2013	Anne Sheehan	CO	University of Colorado at Boulder	Continuing grant	Leonard E.

Do rocks deform in the ductile regime by diffusion creep (with strain rate proportional to stress), or by dislocation creep (where doubling the stress increases strain rates ~10 times)?. Is the lower crust relatively strong, with efficient coupling of strain between the crust and mantle, or weak, as in the classic jelly sandwich model? Is the upper mantle strong, as expected for dry peridotite, or weak, due to high volatile content? Is deformation in the upper mantle localized along shear zones beneath crustal faults, or distributed, as in thin viscous sheet models?<br/><br/>This is a project that will use seismic anisotropy to measure strain in the mantle and that when combined with mineral physics, to constrain deformation mechanisms and therefore to constrain rheology. The PIs maintain that the strike-slip system in New Zealand is the best place to study these relationships because the signal is large and simple with constraints at the surface provided by geology, GPS, and known relative plate motions for the last 45 million years. Specifically the project involves: 1) Deployment of 30 Ocean Bottom Seismographs; 2) Measurement of seismic anisotropy using a variety of techniques (shear-wave splitting, surface wave dispersion, Pn and Sn travel times, and receiver functions); 3) Calculations of mantle finite strain fields that might be responsible for anisotropy, constrained by relative plate motions and observed strain in New Zealand and considering a variety of vertical and lateral distributions of temperature and deformation mechanisms; and 4) Combination of laboratory, theoretical and seismological constraints on anisotropy to bound the conditions under which dislocation creep occurs.

The scientific program at the Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab) includes fundamental experiments that require polarization measurements to be accurate to at least 5%, and some of them require an accuracy of 1-2%. However, all known methods at JLab energies have low analyzing power, and the absolute accuracy is below that required for the approved and anticipated physics programs. The proposed polarimeter is at the present the only solution. The polarimeter will have an experimental asymmetry of approximately 1.7 for an energy range from a few tens of MeV up to several GeV. The polarimeter is simple in construction, compact, and its costs will be lower than for polarimeters built according to any other available method. We have already built and tested two prototypes. The performance of the detectors and the electronics met expectations and the measured analyzing power is as large as predicted. However, more improvements are needed; we need to do additional work on pair production theory and calculations, data acquisition and analyzing software, and the detector hardware.<br/> The proposed research and education program will increase competitiveness of the North Carolina Central University physics and science programs, and improve conditions for the faculty and student recruitment. Well-equipped learning environment and the original research in the fields of nuclear and computational physics, and computer modeling, will increase production of more competitive students. Emerging scientific advances and opportunities will also provide flexibility in career choices of our graduates and adequately prepare our students for further graduate studies. Furthermore, we expect that this program will stimulate research in additional directions, and thereby support the continuing expansion of training for African American graduate and undergraduate students.

Two such techniques will be considered. One is corpus-based schema matching, where a large collection (corpus) of schemas is stored, analyzed, and preprocessed in order to enhance automatic schema matching. The second technique consists of probabilistic-based query answering, which efficiently computes complex SQL queries on probabilistic databases. To study the scalability of these techniques to large-scale data integration tasks, a significant fragment of the Web will be downloaded, and stored locally, on a cluster of servers. Data instances and their schemas will be extracted automatically from these Web pages. The resulting corpus of schemas will be matched using a variety of techniques, and the matches interpreted probabilistically.<br/>The resulting data organization is called the semantic cache. Users will be able to formulate rich queries over the semantic cache, for example in a language like SQL. Each query will be evaluated on the global data, and given a probabilistic interpretation. The answers will be returned to a user ranked according to their probabilities. This project has potential, if successful, to impact a variety of applications where large scale data integration is currently impossible to achieve, such as from scientific data sharing, electronic commerce, and emergency management systems.

The project contains four components related to these spaces: their geometric analysis, the development of appropriate statistical methods, the required numerical analysis, and the application of the results to medical imaging and computational anatomy. The general framework is addressed by a new approach which in some sense formalizes the mechanics of shapes. Lie groups with right invariant metrics indeed are structures on which classical laws of mechanics can be shown to hold, and in particular the conservation of momentum along paths of minimal energy. It turns out that this momentum is a key to the representation and characterization of deformations in this context. It is albeit difficult to handle, because it is usually singular, as a measure, or a distribution on a singular support. This and the numerical difficulty it creates is probably one of the main challenges that we address in our study. Other important aspects are the study of the geometry such an approach induces on shape spaces, including a study of their curvatures, and the existence and stability of normal coordinates. This will be related to open issues in shape statistics, and applied in particular to biomedical imaging problems. <br/><br/>This approach is therefore designed to provide new tools for describing and analyzing shapes. Although shapes are prevalent in the outside world and in science, this is a difficult problem. For the human mind, there is an intuitive notion of what shapes are, why they differ or look alike, or when they present abnormalities with respect to ordinary observations. Sculpture is the art of rendering existing shapes, or creating new ones, and the fact that artists are still able to provide unambiguous instances of subjects through distorted or schematic representations is a strong indication of the robustness of the human shape recognition engine. However, an analytical description of a shape is much less obvious, and humans are much less efficient for this task, as if the understanding and recognition of forms work without an accurate extraction of their constituting components. We can recognize a squash from an eggplant or a pepper via a simple outline, and even provide a series of discriminative features which distinguish them, but it is much harder to phrase a verbal description of any of them, accurate enough, say for a painter to reproduce it. It is therefore not surprising that, for mathematics, shape description remains mostly a challenge. There are however very important applications which depend on progresses made in this field, one of them being the computerized analysis of biomedical shapes (computational anatomy), which analyzes the impact of diseases on shapes of organs, obtained from modern techniques of non-invasive 3D imagery. The last fifty years of research in computer vision has shown a amazingly large variety of points of view and techniques designed for this purpose: 2D or 3D sets they delineate (via either volume or boundary), moment-based features, medial axes or surfaces, null sets of polynomials, configurations of points of interest (landmarks), to name but a few. Yet, it does not seem that any of these methods has emerged as ideal, neither conceptually nor computationally, for describing shapes. An important aspect of our study will be to describe shapes with an indirect approach, from the way they can be deformed. This is not a new idea, and can be traced back to the seminal works of D'Arcy Thompson at the beginning of the 20th century, but its mathematical formalization and the design of practical algorithms is a comprehensive task, still offering many open problems, that the present group will try to address and convey to the scientific community.

0442857	Collaborative Research: The Chemical Ecology of Shallow-water Marine Macroalgae and Invertebrates on the Antarctic Peninsula	PLR	ANTARCTIC ORGANISMS & ECOSYST	07/15/2005	05/21/2008	Bill Baker	FL	University of South Florida	Continuing grant	Roberta L.

Despite their high abundance, the functional ecology, and particularly the trophic relationships of Antarctic amphipods are poorly understood. This project will evaluate the importance of mesograzers (small invertebrate predators approximately 1 to 25 mm in body length) in western Antarctic Peninsula marine communities. This will be accomplished by examining the role of mesoherbivores in structuring macroalgal communities and by elucidating the ecological interactions of mesograzers with a dominant group of benthic macroinvertebrates, the marine sponges. Moreover, chemical studies will be conducted to gain a more thorough understanding of the chemical defenses that Antarctic Peninsula sponges direct towards crustacean mesograzers. Three sets of questions will be addressed concerning the importance of mesograzers, and amphipods in particular, in nearshore habitats of the western Antarctic Peninsula. First, the hypothesis that mesoherbivory is particularly heavy in western Antarctic Peninsula marine communities and has an important influence on algal community structure will be addressed. Initial studies will document which species of amphipods feed in whole or part on microalgae and macroalgae, the incidence and distribution of filamentous endophytes in dominant macroalgae, comparative night time patterns of amphipod abundances on macrophytes, and the role of chemical mediation in these relationships. Second, the broad hypothesis that mesograzers in general, and amphipods in particular, interact with and prey upon sponges to a greater extent than heretofore recognized in Antarctic communities will be tested. The functional basis of these associations will be considered by examining whether the sponges are used as prey, and if so, whether there is evidence that some sponges produce secondary metabolites that show efficacy against mesograzers such as amphipods. Third, the researchers will test the hypotheses that: 1) Antarctic algae and invertebrates biosynthesize secondary metabolites that deter feeding by amphipod predators; and 2) pigments found in three Antarctic sponges are tryptophan catabolites produced as defenses against crustacean predators that impact molting. Evaluation of these hypotheses will be based on isolation and characterization of the specific anti-feeding metabolites, on biosynthetic studies to establish the metabolic origin of the pigments, and on bioassays to establish the chemical defense roles of both groups of compounds. A variety of educational activities will be a major component of this project. Opportunities will be made to support graduate and undergraduate research, both through NSF programs as well as home university-based programs including a number of funded programs that enhance the representation of minorities in the sciences. Through their proven and highly successful interactive web program, the investigators will continue to involve a large numbers of teachers, K-12 students, and other members of the community at large in their scientific endeavors in Antarctica. Moreover, they will actively participate in outreach efforts by presenting numerous talks on their research to school and community groups.

These lakes are unique in their age, stratification, perennial ice cover, and location in closed basins. The consequence of these factors is a high susceptibility to climate change, which their stratified waters record in much the same way that sedimentary rocks record geologic processes. This project will sample three lakes from varied settings. Water samples will be analyzed for major ions, dissolved gases, stable isotopes, and isotopes of helium, chlorine and iodine, each of which offers a unique perspective on the water's source, age, and recent communication with the atmosphere. Results will be coupled with information on lake levels, hypolimnia formations, and ice cover occurrence to understand lake history and Holocene climate.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this work supports graduate and undergraduate research, and development of an on-line site describing lake chemistry and biology. The work also has application to understanding the transport of brine in polar settings, which is relevant to nuclear waste repositories.

Hysteresis behavior of parameters such as susceptibility and coercivity provide clues for the identification of magnetic minerals, magnetic grain size and domain state. An understanding of the magnetic mineralogy, grain size and domain state of the magnetic carriers in sedimentary archives and rocks are critical for accurately interpreting magnetic remanence directional and paleointensity records that can allow for high resolution stratigraphic correlation, plate tectonic reconstructions and elucidation of the past behavior of Earth's magnetic field. In addition, magnetic mineralogy and grain size are useful parameters for interpretation of paleoenvironmental conditions. The AGM/VSM will complement existing paleomagnetic equipment in the Department of Geological Sciences and offer new analytical opportunities for faculty and student research.<br/>***

Vishton	06/30/2011	$742,316.00		mr287@georgetown.edu	37th & O St N W	Washington	DC	200571789	2026250100	SBE	1699	1045, 1187, OTHR, 0000	$0.00	Object recognition is a fundamental cognitive task that is performed effortlessly countless times every day, such as when gauging a conversation partner's facial expression, looking for a friend's face in a crowd, or reading the words of this abstract. All these tasks depend on the visual system's ability to recognize specific objects, despite significant variations in their appearance due to changes in lighting, position, viewpoint, or the simultaneous presence of other objects. Importantly, the visual system is not hard-wired but can be trained for specific tasks, e.g., detecting terrorist camps in satellite images or tumors in X-ray films. Despite the apparent ease with which we see, visual recognition is widely acknowledged to be a very difficult computational problem. From a biological systems perspective, visual recognition involves several levels of understanding, from the computational level, to the levels of cellular and biophysical mechanisms and the level of neuronal circuits, up to the level of behavior. Computational approaches to visual recognition are becoming increasingly important to integrate data from different experiments and levels of description (such as electrophysiology, brain imaging, and behavior) into one coherent, quantitative framework that can then be used to provide rigorous hypotheses for further experiments. With a CAREER award from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Maximilian Riesenhuber is continuing his work on a computational model of object recognition in cortex. He is applying this model to study how visual experience and training on specific tasks shape the brain's representation of the external world and its object recognition capabilities, and how the visual system can successfully recognize objects, even in the presence of interfering stimuli. In particular, the model is being used to provide detailed hypotheses on how training on specific object recognition tasks (ranging from the discrimination of novel stimuli to categorization and object recognition in visual clutter) can modify processing at different levels of the visual system, and how these changes are related to improvements in behavioral performance. This leads to a set of hypotheses that are to be tested with human volunteers in a series of behavioral and brain imaging experiment, using the same stimuli and tasks as in the simulations. Importantly, simulations and experiments are tightly integrated so that experimental results from simpler tasks can be used to refine the model, which can then be used to provide more specific hypotheses for more complex tasks.<br/>The results of this research will be relevant for the design of machine vision systems in artificial intelligence that better mimic how humans see, for the development of human-machine interfaces that optimally leverage the brain's ability to process visual information, and for applications involving human training on object recognition tasks ranging from baggage screening to satellite image analysis. Understanding the neural circuitry involved in object recognition in the typical brain is also important for understanding and ultimately treating object recognition deficits in neural disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and dyslexia. A key element of the CAREER award is Dr. Riesenhuber's plan to use the same computational model that forms the basis of the research effort as an educational tool by developing a model-based curriculum in integrative cognitive neuroscience.

0451240	Biomechanics of Chromosome Structure and Dynamics In Living Cells	MCB	Cellular Dynamics and Function	07/01/2005	03/13/2007	Kerry Bloom	NC	University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill	Continuing grant	Richard Rodewald	06/30/2009	$403,343.00	Richard Superfine	kerry_bloom@unc.edu	104 AIRPORT DR STE 2200	CHAPEL HILL	NC	275991350	9199663411	BIO	1114	1132, 7465, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	The research team will study the biophysical properties of specific chromosomal domains and the role forces play in their function throughout the cell cycle. DNA and RNA polymerases generate considerable force (up to 40pN) during processes of replication and transcription. During mitosis, microtubules attach to centromeric regions to provide the motive force for chromosome segregation. The tension generated by microtubule attachment (~20pN/microtubule) between sister centromeres of replicated chromosomes is critical to the mechanisms that ensure the fidelity of chromosome segregation upon anaphase onset. Thus mechanical force plays a critical role in DNA metabolic processes. However, excessive force (>10pN) can inhibit chromatin assembly in S-phase and breakage of chromosomes with two centromeres (dicentric chromosomes) in mitosis. It is therefore likely that forces on chromosomes are spatially as well as temporally regulated throughout the cell cycle. Recent experiments have addressed the amount of force required to stretch DNA and displace nucleosomes in vitro. These experiments reveal different DNA-protein interactions around the nucleosome core and enhance our understanding of the enzymatic processes that require access to nucleosomal DNA. In this project they will isolate specific chromatin domains and determine the biophysical properties of distinct regions of the chromosomes. They will apply force to chromatin to measure the force-extension relationships for centromeres, euchromatin and telomeric sequences. Intellectual Merit: Using this approach, they will dissect the DNA sequence and protein structural contributions to the biophysical properties of specific sub-chromosomal domains. In addition, they have identified proteins that recognize DNA under tension. By examining the force extension curves for specific chromatin domains in cells lacking these components they will establish the genetic requirements for specific force extension signatures. They expect this work to lead to a Force-extension map for an entire eukaryotic chromosome. This approach will provide the first biomechanical view of the chromosome and will be critical in understanding how energy and structural information is stored. Broader Impact: This research will be integrated into education and outreach through three venues: a networked molecular manipulation project to K12 students, through integration into an undergraduate science perspective course, and through an extensive undergraduate research program. The first program allows K12 students to manipulate real molecules (DNA, Viruses) under an AFM that is located remotely at UNC. In a typical year this program reaches over 200 K12 students, allowing undergraduates and graduate researchers the experience of mentoring and exciting K12 students. The science of forces in mitosis will be included as a section in a science perspective class, How Things Work taught to over 250 non-science majors each year. For undergraduate research, educational goals will focus on integrating research and teaching activities to give students the tools to evaluate and employ new technologies.  About 6 students will study forces in mitosis within an intensive research-based program over the course of the grant.

The approach integrates geophysical surveys, new drilling technology, multidisciplinary core analysis, and ice sheet modeling to address four scientific themes: (1) the history of Antarctica's climate and ice sheets; (2) the evolution of polar biota and ecosystems; (3) the timing and nature of major tectonic and volcanic episodes; and (4) the role of Antarctica in the Earth's ocean-climate system. <br/><br/>This award initiates what may become a long-term program with drilling of two previously inaccessible sediment records beneath the McMurdo Ice Shelf and in South McMurdo Sound. These stratigraphic records cover critical time periods in the development of Antarctica's major ice sheets. The McMurdo Ice Shelf site focuses on the Ross Ice Shelf, whose size is a sensitive indicator of global climate change. It has recently undergone major calving events, and there is evidence of a thousand-kilometer contraction since the last glacial maximum. As a generator of cold bottom water, the shelf may also play a key role in ocean circulation. The core obtained from this site will also offer insight into sub-ice shelf sedimentary, biologic, and oceanographic processes; the history of Ross Island volcanism; and the flexural response of the lithosphere to volcanic loading, which is important for geophysical and tectonic studies of the region.<br/><br/>The South McMurdo Sound site is located adjacent to the Dry Valleys, and focuses on the major ice sheet overlying East Antarctica. A debate persists regarding the stability of this ice sheet. Evidence from the Dry Valleys supports contradictory conclusions; a stable ice sheet for at least the last fifteen million years or an active ice sheet that cycled through expansions and contractions as recently as a few millions of years ago. Constraining this history is critical to deep-time models of global climate change. The sediment cores will be used to construct an overall glacial and interglacial history for the region; including documentation of sea-ice coverage, sea level, terrestrial vegetation, and melt-water discharge events. The core will also provide a general chronostratigraphic framework for regional seismic studies and help unravel the area's complex tectonic history.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include formal and informal education, new research infrastructure, various forms of collaboration, and improving society's understanding of global climate change. Education is supported at the postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 levels. Teachers and curriculum specialists are integrated into the research program, and a range of video resources will be produced, including a science documentary for television release. New research infrastructure includes equipment for core analysis and ice sheet modeling, as well as development of a unique drilling system to penetrate ice shelves. Drill development and the overall project are co-supported by international collaboration with scientists and the National Antarctic programs of New Zealand, Germany, and Italy. The program also forges new collaborations between research and primarily undergraduate institutions within the United States. <br/><br/>As key factors in sea-level rise and oceanic and atmospheric circulation, Antarctica's ice sheets are important to society's understanding of global climate change. ANDRILL offers new data on marine and terrestrial temperatures, and changes our understanding of extreme climate events like the formation of polar ice caps. Such data are critical to developing accurate models of the Earth's climatic future.

The current project assesses the effectiveness of that course, as well as the community college experience, in influencing teachers' beliefs about the nature of science and their use of inquiry-based pedagogies in their own K-8 classrooms.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is its unique focus on community college students. This student population represents approximately half of future teachers, but is under-represented in research on teacher training and practice. Subjects include students who begin their education at a community college and complete a teaching certificate through several pathways. These students are being followed throughout four years of preparation and into the K-8 classroom. One group of subjects comprises Green River students enrolled in a pre-teacher preparation program who take the inquiry-based interdisciplinary science series. A second group (control group) comprises students whose preparation has been more traditional. Both groups then merge into year three of a four-year program housed at Central Washington University, where they take science methods courses. These groups of students are being followed from the first year of college to the K-8 classroom to assess how their beliefs about the nature of science evolve. In addition, the classroom practice and use of instructional materials of teachers who belong to both the experimental and control groups is being assessed. The use of a cross-sectional design allows subjects to be assessed at various points along this teacher preparation continuum.<br/><br/>Findings on the influence of interdisciplinary, inquiry-based science courses on teacher beliefs and practices will be broadly applicable to community colleges and four-year institutions. The outcomes advance our understanding of how best to prepare SMT teachers. In addition, the role of community colleges in SMT teacher preparation is being addressed, with the potential of expanding the model of interdisciplinary science courses to other community colleges nation-wide.

Most current research is based on analytical or simulation models; due to the complexity of radio propagation in the real world and a lack of understanding about the behavior of real wireless applications and users, these models are severely limited. On the other hand, the difficult logistical challenges involved in collecting detailed traces of wireless network activity preclude most people from working with experimental data. The investigators will build on experience collecting data from wireless networks that has bee released to the research community. <br/>The project will construct a shared facility for storing large data sets collected from real wireless networks, develop common formats and tools for collecting, anonymizing, and analyzing this data, host visiting students who want to use the archive or collaborate on tool development, work with community leaders to encourage contribution to and use of the archive, coordinate with other community efforts to develop network trace formats and tools, and encourage educators to use the tools and data in course projects, and to share course modules.<br/>This project will have broad academic and practical impact in the wireless network community through enabling research by users of the data resources, providing data and analysis software for educators, and involving women and minorities in the project.<br/>

The program will develop interrelated climate, ice dynamics, and biologic records focused on understanding interactions of global earth systems. The records will have a year-by-year chronology for the most recent 40,000 years. Lower temporal resolution records will extend to 100,000 years before present. The intellectual activity of this project includes enhancing our understanding of the natural mechanisms that cause climate change. The study site was selected to obtain the best possible material, available from anywhere, to determine the role of greenhouse gas in the last series of major climate changes. The project will study the how natural changes in greenhouse gas concentrations influence climate. The influence of sea ice and atmospheric circulation on climate changes will also be investigated. Other topics that will be investigated include the influence of the West Antarctic ice sheet on changes in sea level and the biology deep in the ice sheet. The broader impacts of this project include developing information required by other science communities to improve predictions of future climate change. The <br/>project will use mass media to explain climate, glaciology, and biology issues to a broad audience. The next generation of ice core investigators will be trained and there will be an emphasis on exposing a diverse group of students to climate, glaciology and biology research.

However, to date, complex constraints of trust and confidentiality often prohibit the dissemination of data. Data that could safely be disseminated to others remains hidden behind firewalls. This project aims at producing lightweight tools that allows publication and dissemination of data while at the same time controlling how data is accessed. New data management techniques are developed that use cryptographic primitives in order to enforce access control policies in published XML documents. In cryptographically enforced access control, the data owner publishes a single data instance, which is partially encrypted, and which enforces all access control policies. The project develops a declarative language for access policies, based on XQuery, and a method for applying these policies to an XML data instance to produce a single, multiply-encrypted XML view. This view can then be published by the data owner on the Internet, and everyone can freely download and disseminate it. The crucial aspect is that only users having the right keys can access encrypted parts of the XML document. Different users holding different set of keys will have access to different parts of the document. The project also develops an XQuery interpreter to enable authorized users, holding the right keys, to execute queries on the encrypted view. The interpreter decrypts data on the fly, and only that data required to answer the query. A novel kind of data model, called protection tree, is developed which captures how various keys protect different parts of the XML data. The protection tree is central to the proposed approach: once the security policies are applied to the XML data instance, they produce a protection tree; and the data model that forms the input to the user queries is also modeled as a protection tree. The results of this research will be applicable to providing secure access to XML documents. The project Web site (http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/pjallen/cryptography.html) will be used for free dissemination of results; specifically, a policy query evaluator (which produces the encrypted view), a decrypting XQuery interpreter (which is used to query the encrypted view), and a consistency checker. This project will also provide educational and research experience in the Cyber Trust area.

These benefits are well known. The research experience, however, has traditionally been restricted to the best and the brightest students. The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) has successfully implemented the Affinity Research Group (ARG) model that expands the range to include those who historically have not been involved in undergraduate research, including those who are competent, but may lack the confidence to seek a research position. The ARG model provides both undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to learn, use, and integrate the knowledge and skills that are required for research with those required for cooperative work. This model integrates best practices from a variety of sources in industry, research, and education. <br/><br/>This project refines the educational materials used in the ARG model, fully develops the ARG model products and processes, distributes the ARG educational materials across a range of institutions, and evaluates the transfer of the ARG model to geographically and culturally diverse institutions.

While stability is a fundamental requirement for any<br/>successful structure, for thin-walled structures, cross-section stability is the primary constraint. Complex to analyze and difficult to design, thin-walled structures are nevertheless highly efficient. Material is minimized in thin-walled members, a must when embracing costly new materials for use in our high volume, low-cost, physical infrastructure. <br/><br/>This proposal advances an integrated plan of theoretical,<br/>computational, and experimental work to (1) implement new techniques in computational stability of particular need for thin-walled members; (2) develop and verify new methods that provide more efficient, robust, and reliable designs; and (3) create new resources that increase the breadth and depth of the PI's efforts in structural stability education while strengthening partnerships at Hopkins and in the community. Cross-section instability greatly complicates the behavior of thin-walled members; and current computational stability techniques do little to add clarity. Proposed here is a new modal decomposition technique that provides (i) model reduction, the ability to isolate the strain fields consistent with specific classes of cross-section instability, and then perform meaningful analysis with as little as one degree of freedom, and (ii) modal identification, a means to classify a general member deformation field into the basic modes of cross-section instability which make up that field, and thus quantify modal interactions. Development of modal decomposition provides a unique means to investigate a variety of open questions in structural stability, particularly related to coupled and mixed modes. Empiricism and an over-reliance on classical plate buckling solutions complicates the design of thin walled structures and hinders efficiency as designers are tied to the solutions of the past. A new design method, developed by the PI for thin-walled steel structures, seeks to provide flexibility and reliability by attacking cross-section instability computationally and integrating the results into a comprehensive design process. New developments to extend this design methodology to beam-columns and members with perforations are proposed. Large changes in design such as those proposed here require careful experimentation and computation to understand the ramifications and provide a valid and verified methodology. Further, a specific plan is provided for extending the new design method to thin-walled members made of materials other than steel, including aluminum and thermoplastics.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: this proposal provides for (i) the development of a novel modal decomposition<br/>technique of use in model reduction and modal identification in computational structural stability<br/>problems and its application to a variety of important stability issues, and (ii) the practical extension and verification of computational structural stability into everyday design of thin-walled steel members, including the unique role of cross-sectional stability under complex loading as in beam-columns, and members with perforations. The proposed modal decomposition technique and the developed design methodologies represent significant advances for both the theory and design of thin-walled members and have the potential to spur new discoveries and innovation. A plan is proposed for extending the design methods to a variety of other important thin-walled materials including aluminum and thermoplastics. The proposed activity relies extensively on the PI's experience in experimental and computational structural stability for thin-walled members and provides a needed platform for continued development.<br/><br/>Broader impact: The PI's involvement in development of design specifications and technical committees ensures that both the practicing engineering community and the research community will benefit in the findings. Additionally, the education plan detailed herein insures that high school, undergraduate, and graduate students will also all benefit from the proposed work. The high school outreach efforts focus on enriching the PI's ongoing collaboration with Baltimore Polytechnical High School (Poly), a school with predominately minority student enrollment. Strengthening the relationship with Poly provides an important venue for science and engineering activism with underrepresented groups. The undergraduate education efforts are teamed with the Hopkins Center for Educational Resources and will enable the development of pedagogically sound online teaching guides in structural stability. Research findings, including the educational efforts, will be disseminated by journal papers, conference talks, and by the PI's ongoing efforts with several technical committees.

A 3D printer is a device that operates much like a conventional printer, but the file sent to the printer describes a 3D object, and the printer actually produces as output a physical model of the 3D object. A laser cutter is a something like a high-tech band saw. Both will be used in four ways: (1) To support the investigators research in computational geometry, by making physical models of complex polyhedra, protein models, and origami-like folded objects; (2) To support the research of other faculty in the Sciences; (2) To support faculty research and student projects in the Smith College Engineering program; (3) To facilitate faculty and student projects in Art, Architecture, and Arts & Technology. The equipment will enable new research by faculty across the College, expose many undergraduate students to this technology via senior projects, and affect K-12 students through the PI's work on using folding and unfolding to teach a variety of topics at the 6th- through 12th-grade levels.

Apoptotic cells are recognized and engulfed by neighboring cells or professional phagocytes such as macrophages. The mechanism of recognition is complex and poorly understood, but depends on the rearrangement of the phospholipids that make up the two leaflets of the plasma membrane. Lipid rearrangement induces membrane proteins to join the recognition process, but the mechanism of this induction is not understood. Prior to rearrangement, some phospholipids and cholesterol in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane aggregate into domains, or rafts, which segregate from the rest of the membrane some, but not all, of the proteins that cooperate in the recognition of apoptotic cells. The rearrangement of lipids in apoptotic cells may result in the disappearance of these rafts, creating new contacts between receptors and both lipids and other proteins; disruption of rafts is thus a potential mechanism for activating and combining recognition proteins. Determining whether lipid rearrangement disrupts rafts requires analyzing the status of rafts in small subpopulations of still living cells. Dr. Williamson and his students will combine a biophysical approach for detecting rafts (measuring the correlation between fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence intensity) with flow cytometric analysis of cell subpopulations to determine whether lipid rafts are disrupted during apoptosis.<br/><br/>The research in this project will be entirely integrated into an undergraduate teaching environment. Most of the experiments will be carried out by undergraduates, including seniors as part of a capstone research experience, and freshmen/sophomores as an introduction to laboratory research, all under the direct supervision of the Principal Investigator. In addition, the laboratory has repeatedly hosted middle and high school science teachers with no previous exposure to research, for whom this project would be an introduction to the practice of science. The project proposes to develop a (reversible) modification of the mostly widely distributed benchtop clinical cytometer as a platform for testing living cells for the presence of lipid rafts.

Activation of one member of this family in Xenopus laevis, XEphA4, leads to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton via a mechanism involving inhibition of the small GTPase XRhoA. The rest of the biochemical pathway by which XEphA4 mediates its effects is largely unknown. This project will test the hypothesis that the tyrosine kinase Fyn (a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases) is involved in signaling by XEphA4. The hypothesis will be tested using a Xenopus laevis embryo assay system. This system allows expression and activation of XEphA4 in early frog embryos (at a time when the receptor would not normally be expressed), which results in loss of cell adhesion, change in cell shape, and loss of cell polarity by epithelial cells. Candidate molecules in the signaling pathway, such as Fyn in the current project, can be tested by expressing mutant forms of the candidate molecule alone or in conjunction with XEphA4 and assessing the effect on embryo phenotype. The hypothesis will be tested using experimental approaches that comprise four objectives, each of which tests a prediction based on the hypothesis. Objective 1 will test whether constitutively-active Fyn can recreate the XEphA4 phenotype. Objective 2 will determine whether inhibition of Fyn prevents the phenotypic effects of XEphA4. Objective 3 will test whether constitutive activity of XRhoA can prevent the effects of active Fyn. Objective 4 will assay for changes in Fyn activity levels in response to XEPhA4 activity. This project should add greatly to understanding of Eph receptor signaling, and will have broader impact through training of graduate and undergraduate students, including pre-service secondary-level biology teachers, and through outreach programs to local secondary schools.

The nucleolus has long been known as the seat of ribosome biosynthesis. However, a few years ago Dr. Pederson proposed in a semi-speculative essay (Pederson, T. 1998. The Plurifunctional Nucleolus. Nucleic Acids Research 26:3871-3876) that the nucleolus has other functions as well. This idea was greeted receptively and before long, increasing evidence began to be obtained as several groups turned their attention to the concept of a plurifunctional nucleolus.<br/><br/>Dr. Pederson's work on this concept has centered on the hypothesis that the nucleolus is a key station in the assembly of the signal recognition particle (SRP). His laboratory has identified both the RNA and certain protein components of the SRP in the nucleoli of cultured mammalian cells, as well as in the amplified nucleoli of frog oocytes. However, whether these components are actually in molecular contact with one another in the nucleolus has not been established, and this is one of the major objectives of the present project. Dr. Pederson has also speculated that the nucleolus may serve as a center for the coordinated co-regulation of SRP and ribosome synthesis (Pederson, T. and Politz, J.C. 2000. The Nucleolus and the Four Ribonucleoproteins of Translation. J. Cell Biology 148:1091-1095.) This hypothesis is also addressed in the present project. <br/><br/>In relation to the broader aspects of the field, it is to be borne in mind that numerous other functions have been suggested for the nucleolus recently, particularly relating to cell cycle progression. In addition, it has been claimed that some translation occurs in the nucleus, including in the nucleolus. The evidence for this is provocative but not definitive (Pederson, T. 2001. Is the Nucleus in Need of Translation? Trends in Cell Biology 11:395-397), and contradictory results have been obtained subsequently. However, neither of these additional putative functions are addressed directly in this project.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/><br/>Dr. Pederson is committed to the scientific education of both young students and the public at large. The project will serve as a platform for summer research training for undergraduate students drawn from a variety of colleges in the Worcester area, including members of underrepresented groups.

Unfortunately numerous accounts of failures cite the root cause as problems related to the incorrect implementation of non-functional qualities such as safety, security, or reliability. The objective of this research is to develop a new technique known as Goal-Centric Traceability (GCT) that will provide effective support for managing systemic qualities. GCT is designed to prevent systemwide non-functional qualities from being adversely impacted during the change process and to ensure the long-term quality of the system. The work will involve developing dynamic traceability techniques between functional and non-functional requirements using probabilistic and constraint-based methods. Heuristics and supporting methods will be defined for identifying the transitive impact of a change upon systemic goals and for automating the re-evaluation of existing assessment models such as performance simulations and executable scenarios. A standard interface for interfacing GCT with popular architectural assessment tools will be developed. The work has potential for significant impact as it addresses a complex yet practical problem commonly experienced in industry.

The project involves the PI's comprehensive career development program. The research part builds on and significantly broadens the PI's successful work in the field of computational materials science. The PI proposes several novel and interdisciplinary projects for future research in this exciting field. Research topics discussed in the proposal include studies of strain-assisted self-assembly of semiconductor heterostructures on nanometer length scales, recrystallization kinetics, and microstructure and dislocation evolution in pure metals and alloys on mesoscopic length scales.<br/>Intellectual merit. Developing predictive tools and models for microstructural evolution is a challenging task due to the fact that different physical processes operate across several length and time scales simultaneously. Given the fact that there does not exist a single computational approach that can describe all physical processes of interest, the PI will construct appropriate physically-based continuum models which are simulated by sophisticated numerical methods and linked to more fundamental (i.e., microscopic) approaches. In this sense, the approach described in this proposal can be regarded as a multiscale one. These studies will lead to a better understanding of nonlinear microstructure formation processes on atomic and mesoscopic scales, and this in turn will push the frontiers of predictive modeling of these technologically important systems beyond what is currently possible.<br/>Broader impacts. A successful scientist is both a prolific researcher and an outstanding teacher and mentor. Thus, the PI's career development plan contains a strong educational component. The PI will incorporate his research topics into both undergraduate and graduate curricula at Princeton University. The PI's research will also involve undergraduate and graduate students on many different levels. For example, the PI will train highly qualified and critically thinking graduate students who possess the technical tools required to succeed in today's and tomorrow's science and engineering. It is noteworthy that for graduate students who do not wish to continue in academia upon their graduation, this line of research has much to offer, since there is a growing need for computational materials scientists within industry. Undergraduate students will be involved with the PI's research through Junior Projects and Senior Theses, as well as through an outreach program involving undergraduate students from schools that do not have strong research programs. Additionally, the PI will incorporate his research within two other outreach programs aimed at exposing high school students and teachers to materials science. The results of this research will be made available to other researchers and the general public through publications in peer reviewed journals and active participation in conferences and workshops. In short, the PI believes that the research and educational programs outlined here together comprise a comprehensive and ambitious career development plan which will significantly advance our understanding of complex microstructure formation processes, as well as positively impact the lives and careers of undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.<br/>NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION: The research project involves developing techniques for computational materials science and applying them to a variety of materials systems such as semiconductors and metallic alloys. The education component involves the integration of students at all levels into research, outreach and integrating research results into teaching.
0439733	Timing, Conditions, and Rates of Thrust Transport in the Nepalese Himalaya	EAR	TECTONICS	07/15/2005	07/22/2005	Matthew Kohn	SC	University South Carolina Research Foundation	Standard Grant	David Fountain	01/31/2008	$129,993.00		mattkohn@boisestate.edu	1600 Hampton Street	COLUMBIA	SC	292080001	8037777093	GEO	1572	0000, OTHR, 9150	$0.00	A new petrologic and chronologic approach developed by the principal investigator for high-grade rocks in the Langtang region (east-central Nepal) demonstrates that thrust fault movement rates since about 20 million years ago are generally consistent with convergence of the Indian subcontinent at about 2 cm/yr (equivalent to modern rates), but that thrust rates were variable, with emplacement of one thrust sheet at a rate 2-3 times the average rate. These data also highlight the importance of rapid erosion (5-10 mm/yr) in exhuming metamorphic rocks over the last 3-4 million years. The purpose of the proposed research is to test whether these patterns are also found in two other areas - the Annapurna region to the west, and the Arun region in far eastern Nepal - and to test whether the Greater Himalayan Sequence experienced high-pressure or ultra-high-pressure metamorphism. The following methods are being used: (1) Chemical mapping and quantitative microanalysis of monazite grains, and dating of chemically distinct domains via ion microprobe. These ages are documenting the timing of cooling, which for many structural levels is a direct result of thrust movement. (2) Determination of pressure-temperature conditions and conversion to paleoposition via published thermal models for the Himalaya. The amount of displacement, and timing of cooling and thrust movement for each sheet is being converted to estimates of thrust rate. (3) Determination of ages and P-T conditions of eclogites in the Arun region to determine whether these are related to early Himalayan deformation. This work has major broad implications for tectonics research and its interrelationship with erosion and Earth's chemical evolution. This work will also support the education of one graduate student in geochemistry/tectonics.

Tremendous progress has been made in the development of microfluidic devices in the last decade with applications such as a lab-on-a-chip, ink-jet printer heads, cell sorters, DNA sequencers, and blood-testing systems. Microdroplets are being used in microfluidic devices as actuators, chemical microreactors, drug delivery devices, and bioterror detection tools. However, a limited number of experimental studies exist to date on the deformation and break up of drops and bubbles in microfluidic devices. Typical applications of two-phase systems in microdevices involve viscoelastic fluids such as DNA solutions, blood, serum, and inks and suspensions with surfactants added as stabilizers. The stretching of polymer chains present in viscoelastic fluids causes large normal stresses to develop at strongly deforming interfaces affecting the dynamics of drops. Surfactant molecules adsorbed at the interface can redistribute along the interface leading to a local reduction in surface tension. This may result in highly curved interfaces and reduced tangential velocities due to the induced Marangoni stresses. The dynamics of a fluid particle in the presence of elastic and surfactant effects can be very complex and has been studied to a very limited extent even at a macroscale. The major research objectives of this study are: (1) to identify parameters governing the drop size and distribution of drops forming in a rectangular microchannel; (2) to determine the drop velocity and deformation for a drop translating in a rectangular microchannel; (3) to determine the effect of elastic stresses on the drop size and distribution in the drop formation and terminal velocity of a drop translating in a microchannel, and (4) determine the effect of mass transfer kinetics of surfactants on the deformation and pinch-off dynamics of drops in the microchannel.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The research objectives will be accomplished by performing a comprehensive experimental and numerical study of viscoelastic drops and bubbles in microdevices in the presence of surfactants. Microfluidic devices will be fabricated using soft lithography techniques in the PI's research laboratory. Two classes of experiments will be completed: (a) the deformation of a single drop/bubble translating in a straight channel in the presence of surfactants and/or elasticity and (b) the deformation and subsequent break up of viscoelastic drops/bubbles generated in a microdroplet generator with surfactants. A three-dimensional numerical model will be developed to predict the shape and velocity of a drop forming or translating in a microchannel using a hybrid volume-of-fluid method. The front-tracking scheme which explicitly tracks the interface predicts the interfacial topography and stresses accurately allowing simulations of drops with low density and viscosity ratios. The ability to predict the shapes and distributions of viscoelastic drops in microfluidic devices opens up exciting possibilities for the development of novel microdevices which use two-phase viscoelastic biofluids, suspensions, and polymer blends.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: In addition to advancing the field of interfacial phenomena in microfluidic devices, this research will lead to a new elective course in the Chemical Engineering undergraduate/graduate curriculum on 'Microfluidics: Theory and Applications'. The course will draw material from the PI's own research and will provide the students with hands-on experience in her laboratory. This project will create the first facility for soft lithography at the University of New Hampshire. The PI, being a woman and a minority engineer herself, will encourage the involvement of women and members of minority groups in her research and in the field of science and engineering in general.

The main open problem in random Schrodinger operators is delocalization; the existence of extended states. The study of delocalization in random Schrodinger operators is the main goal of this proposal. A major objective of this proposal is to prove dynamical delocalization in random Schrodinger operators, using the new approach to the metal-insulator transition based on transport instead of spectral properties introduced by the PI and Germinet. In addition, questions related to localization and linear response theory will be investigated.<br/><br/>In quantum mechanics, random Schrodinger operators describe the motion of an electron in a crystal with impurities. The impurities are modeled as a random media (or material). While the pure materials may be conductors, impurities change the conduction properties of materials. At energies in the region where impurities create localized states the material behaves as an insulator, while at energies with extended (delocalized) states the material behaves as a conductor. Examples of materials with impurities are given by doped semiconductors, which have many applications in electronics. The proposed research will further the understanding of the changes in the conduction properties of such materials caused by the addition of impurities.

This protein, AmpA, functions as a novel signaling molecule that plays both autocrine and paracrine roles controlling cell adhesion and cell fate specification during growth and development. Dictyostelium is a model system extensively used to study cell migration and development. AmpA functions to reduce cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, promoting migration of these cells facilitating their ability to forage for food. During the developmental phase of the life cycle the expression of the ampA gene is restricted to a small, but highly motile subset of cells whose migrations are necessary for proper morphogenesis. AmpA expression is essential for migration of these cells. It also acts as a lateral inhibitory signal that prevents adjacent cells from assuming a prespore fate. The simplest model for AmpA function is that it is a modulator of an integrin like receptor. Integrin receptors, however, have not been identified outside of metazoan organisms and there is no obvious integrin receptor that can be identified by sequence homology in Dictyostelium. The objective of this project is to identify the adhesion receptor that is modulated by interaction with the AmpA protein and to identify additional genes that are candidates to function in the AmpA modulated signaling pathway. Aim 1: will use biochemical and molecular genetic approaches to identify and characterize the receptor to which AmpA binds. Aim 2: will use a genetic approach, isolation of second site suppressor mutations, to identify additional genes that function in the AmpA mediated signal transduction pathways. Using AmpA as a probe to identify the adhesion receptors that are modulated by its action and to identify other genes that function downstream in the AmpA signaling pathway should help to elucidate the nature of cell-substrate adhesion and its modulation to promote cell migration and provide insight to how the metozoan integrin paradigm evolved. It should be noted that this project will involve graduate and undergraduate students, some of whom are members of under represented minorities. The research experience gained working on this project will contribute to their scientific education.

These lakes are unique in their age, stratification, perennial ice cover, and location in closed basins. The consequence of these factors is a high susceptibility to climate change, which their stratified waters record in much the same way that sedimentary rocks record geologic processes. This project will sample three lakes from varied settings. Water samples will be analyzed for major ions, dissolved gases, stable isotopes, and isotopes of helium, chlorine and iodine, each of which offers a unique perspective on the water's source, age, and recent communication with the atmosphere. Results will be coupled with information on lake levels, hypolimnia formations, and ice cover occurrence to understand lake history and Holocene climate.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this work supports graduate and undergraduate research, and development of an on-line site describing lake chemistry and biology. The work also has application to understanding the transport of brine in polar settings, which is relevant to nuclear waste repositories.

Such experiments enable undergraduates to reflect on their responses to economic incentives and on the role of institutional arrangements, thus gaining a deeper understanding of economic models than they have acquired using less-interactive learning environments. However, many institutions lack the resources to develop their own dedicated experimental economics facilities. Building on work to develop EconPort, an economics digital library, this project is undertaking a national effort to disseminate experiments to hundreds of instructors from a diverse set of two- and four-year colleges around the country. Instructors learn about the experiments, and how to integrate them into their courses, at workshops that are held primarily in conjunction with economics conferences around the country. Formative project evaluation is informing the development and presentation of the workshop materials; summative evaluation addresses the efficacy of the workshops and how the use of economics experiments shapes successful teaching strategies.

Conversely, friendship difficulties can compromise development and can be the source of considerable conflict and aggression in school settings. Thus, understanding the nature and source of friendship difficulties is an important applied and theoretical goal. The broad goal of this work is to expand understanding of the nature of friendship experiences at the transition to adolescence by exploring the jealousy sometimes associated with outside interference in friendship. Past research demonstrates that some individual children show strong jealous reactions when their friends have other friends or engage in activities with other peers. These children report depression and more negative personal well-being than other children, and appear to behave negatively and aggressively towards others. This work will extend understanding of the nature, antecedences, and consequences of this important vulnerability. Specifically, the first goal of the work is to examine how the behavior of characteristically jealous children differs from that of their non-jealous peers and to articulate the emotions, attributions, and behavioral strategies these individuals endorse in jealous circumstances. A second objective is to examine whether the tendency to act jealous over friends is associated with broader indices of problematic social adjustment, including peer rejection and victimization. The final objective is to extend understanding of the psychological roots of friendship jealousy by exploring how specific family processes may compromise the self-images of children and contribute to these children's hyper-vigilance around peers and sensitivity to outsider interference.

An important task of such geosensor networks is to collect, analyze and estimate information about continuous phenomena under observation such as a toxic cloud close to a chemical plant in real-time and in an energy-efficient way. The main thrust of this project is the integration of spatial data analysis techniques with in-network data query execution in sensor networks. The project investigates novel algorithms such as incremental, in-network kriging that redefines a traditional, highly computationally intensive spatial data estimation method for a distributed, collaborative and incremental processing between tiny, energy and bandwidth constrained sensor nodes. This work includes the modeling of location and sensing characteristics of sensor devices with regard to observed phenomena, the support of temporal-spatial estimation queries, and a focus on in-network data aggregation algorithms for complex spatial estimation queries. Combining high-level data query interfaces with advanced spatial analysis methods will allow domain scientists to use sensor networks effectively in environmental observation. The project has a broad impact on the community involving undergraduate and graduate students in spatial database research at the University of Maine as well as being a key component of a current IGERT program in the areas of sensor materials, sensor devices and sensor. More information about this project, publications, simulation software, and empirical studies are available on the project's web site (http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~nittel/career/).

Hill<br/><br/>Attrition and fragmentation of particles are of significant scientific and industrial interest. Process applications span a range of industries including the fertilizer, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. One of the reasons that particle breakage is so important in the chemical process industries is that it alters the size and the shape of the particles. Both product quality and process operability strongly depend on particle size and shape, yet little research has been done on the affect of breakage on particle shape. The objectives of this project are to correct this deficiency by investigating the evolution of both particle size and shape in a stirred vessel, and to train future engineers to account for particle size and shape in the evaluation of solids processes. The project has two major sections: research and education. The research program of theory, modeling, and experimentation aims to: 1) determine the effect of Ostwald ripening on breakage experiments in a saturated solution, and 2) to link a macroscale model of breakage in a stirred vessel to microscale particle fracture mechanics using mathematical models based on first principles. This model will be tested experimentally. The research and education programs are integrated by introducing new research results into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum and by having selected students actively participate in ongoing research. Specifically the education program consists of: 1) developing a new graduate elective course in particle and crystallization technology, 2) developing educational software based on the research program models, 3) engaging graduate and undergraduate students in active research, and 4) developing educational modules in particle technology for use with K-12 students.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This research is expected to benefit both academia and industry. The key to designing better solids processes is quantitatively incorporating fundamental physical phenomena and properties into the design process. The proposed work would make a significant addition by providing a basis for including particle shape changes due to breakage and attrition in a design methodology. Although this research is developed for particle fragmentation and attrition in stirred vessels such as crystallizers, it has broader impact in other unit operations that have particle breakage such as crushers, fluidized beds, pumps, and mixers. It is expected that this work would lead to models of potential interest to commercial chemical process simulation companies. Not limited to chemical engineering operations, it would have applications in other industries such as minerals and food processing.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This plan provides for educational outreach to students at a wide range of educational levels: K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. Diversity is enhanced by actively recruiting undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups to participate in research activities, and by including students from underrepresented groups in the K-12 educational activities. Since deficiencies in particle technology knowledge and education harm the global competitive position of the U.S., this project contributes to society by improving the understanding and modeling of particle behavior and by educating people to better address particle technology issues.

Similarity searches in NDDSs are becoming increasingly important for applications based on multidimensional discrete vectors, such as genome sequence databases, biometrics and E-commerce. Efficient similarity searches require robust indexing techniques in order to provide fast access to data. The currently existing indexing methods are either not suitable for an NDDS (e.g., the R*-tree) or too generic to provide good performance for an NDDS (e.g., metric trees). The main goal of this project is to study the fundamental properties of NDDSs and develop indexing methods exploiting these properties to support efficient similarity searches in NDDSs. A set of essential geometric concepts for an NDDS is introduced based on extended methods for traditional (ordered) continuous data spaces. A number of promising data-partitioning-based and space-partitioning-based indexing techniques (including index tree structures, building strategies, search algorithms and performance models) using these concepts for NDDSs are explored and compared. Other related issues including supporting various types of queries, adopting different distance measures, indexing hybrid data spaces with mixed ordered and non-ordered dimensions, developing efficient bulk loading techniques and utilizing effective compression schemes are studied. This research will provide new database indexing techniques to solve relevant issues in scientific, medical and commerce fields that require fast access to large volumes of NDDS data. Research results, including software tools or programs and experimental data will be disseminated via the projects' Web sites (http://www.cse.msu/~pramanik/nsf05/nsf05msu.html and <br/>http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/~qzhu/nsf05/nsf05umd.html).

IMRT is considered to be the most effective radiation therapy for many forms of cancer. Current approaches decompose the treatment planning problem into several stages and the corresponding subproblems are solved sequentially. Although this may lead to inferior treatment plans, the lack of suitable model formulations that allow for efficient solution methods has so far prevented the integration of the subproblems. In particular, the subproblem that has received the most attention is the central problem of determining an intensity profile or fluence map for each of the beams used in irradiating a cancer patient. However, issues pertaining to treatment-delivery efficiency and quality are known to have a significant impact on IMRT treatments. Models that fully take into account both potential and limitations of the treatment equipment as well as changes in the patient anatomy over the course of the treatment will be developed along with algorithms to solve the resulting integrated problems. All of the developed models and algorithms will be tested on actual clinical patient data.<br/><br/>Every year, hundreds of thousands of patients receive cancer treatment by radiation therapy. This project will provide highly effective and robust integrated models for IMRT treatment-planning problems that integrate clinical considerations that are currently not yet addressed satisfactorily. The development of efficient approaches to solve the resulting integrated optimization problems in realistic computational times will provide real-time decision support to physicians and clinicians and will help them to find treatment plans that do not require a choice between a good chance for a cure or control of disease and the potential quality of life.

His work extends to investigating the neural underpinnings of pattern perception in general. His project is designed to extend earlier promising work on important theoretical issues related to music processing. The research methods include behavioral measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The project takes into account that simply knowing where an operation occurs in the brain is not necessarily useful. The present series of investigations, however, is designed in such a way that knowing where processing occurs in the brain may elucidate the more interesting questions of what is being processed in the brain, and how this processing occurs. Evidence from neuroanatomical studies can inform and constrain theories of cognition. Dr. Menon's project builds on his previous observation that Brodmann Area 47 in the Inferior Frontal Cortex (IFC) is responsible for processing structure in music, as well as spoken and sign language. This raises the intriguing possibility that this region instantiates a general purpose temporal organization module. Accordingly, the specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) extend his previous musical structure study with a new group of subjects so as to (a) obtain a more precise localization of temporal processing functions and (b) investigate similarities and differences in IFC and temporal lobe response and connectivity for familiar and unfamiliar music; (2) Manipulate the level of expectation present in the musical stimuli, in an effort to provide additional evidence for the syntactic operations subserved by the IFC; and (3) Examine the differential effects of variation in pitch and rhythm structure on brain responses in, and connectivity of, the IFC and the auditory cortex. Findings will be relevant to theories of modularity of mental function, temporal coherence, pattern perception, music cognition, and brain organization. This research will contribute to understanding the neural architecture supporting music and auditory perception and cognition in humans.<br/><br/>The broader impacts include strong involvement of students, including undergraduates, doctoral, and postdoctoral scholars. The project is multidisciplinary, bringing together two different groups of researchers, one trained in classical cognitive psychology, and the other trained in cognitive neuroscience and brain imaging.. Findings can help to better understand prefrontal and temporal cortex dysfunction in neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Meng, SUNY Binghamton and 0414939, C. Yu, UIC) is to develop technologies for providing integrated access to Web databases. The approach consists of developing highly automated solutions to the following tasks: discovering Web databases from the Web, clustering them according to their application domains, integrating the search interfaces of the Web databases in the same domain into an integrated search interface, mapping each query submitted to an integrated interface to its underlying Web databases, extracting and annotating the search result records from the result pages returned from the local Web databases, and merging the results to form an integrated response for presentation to the user. Web services based interfaces of Web databases, if available, will be utilized. The evaluation of the developed algorithms is based on real Web databases from different domains. This research is expected to produce new algorithms, useful datasets, a software toolkit, and several operational Web database metasearch engines (including some for the Air Force Research Lab at Rome). The developed technology can be used in many applications including comparison shopping and collecting data from the deep Web. Research results will be incorporated into several courses the PIs teach and students will be recruited to participate in the research activities. Research results will be disseminated through published papers as well as a textbook on Web-based search technology.

Despite their high abundance, the functional ecology, and particularly the trophic relationships of Antarctic amphipods are poorly understood. This project will evaluate the importance of mesograzers (small invertebrate predators approximately 1 to 25 mm in body length) in western Antarctic Peninsula marine communities. This will be accomplished by examining the role of mesoherbivores in structuring macroalgal communities and by elucidating the ecological interactions of mesograzers with a dominant group of benthic macroinvertebrates, the marine sponges. Moreover, chemical studies will be conducted to gain a more thorough understanding of the chemical defenses that Antarctic Peninsula sponges direct towards crustacean mesograzers. Three sets of questions will be addressed concerning the importance of mesograzers, and amphipods in particular, in nearshore habitats of the western Antarctic Peninsula. First, the hypothesis that mesoherbivory is particularly heavy in western Antarctic Peninsula marine communities and has an important influence on algal community structure will be addressed. Initial studies will document which species of amphipods feed in whole or part on microalgae and macroalgae, the incidence and distribution of filamentous endophytes in dominant macroalgae, comparative night time patterns of amphipod abundances on macrophytes, and the role of chemical mediation in these relationships. Second, the broad hypothesis that mesograzers in general, and amphipods in particular, interact with and prey upon sponges to a greater extent than heretofore recognized in Antarctic communities will be tested. The functional basis of these associations will be considered by examining whether the sponges are used as prey, and if so, whether there is evidence that some sponges produce secondary metabolites that show efficacy against mesograzers such as amphipods. Third, the researchers will test the hypotheses that: 1) Antarctic algae and invertebrates biosynthesize secondary metabolites that deter feeding by amphipod predators; and 2) pigments found in three Antarctic sponges are tryptophan catabolites produced as defenses against crustacean predators that impact molting. Evaluation of these hypotheses will be based on isolation and characterization of the specific anti-feeding metabolites, on biosynthetic studies to establish the metabolic origin of the pigments, and on bioassays to establish the chemical defense roles of both groups of compounds. A variety of educational activities will be a major component of this project. Opportunities will be made to support graduate and undergraduate research, both through NSF programs as well as home university-based programs including a number of funded programs that enhance the representation of minorities in the sciences. Through their proven and highly successful interactive web program, the investigators will continue to involve a large numbers of teachers, K-12 students, and other members of the community at large in their scientific endeavors in Antarctica. Moreover, they will actively participate in outreach efforts by presenting numerous talks on their research to school and community groups.

0446292	Does Composition of the Exopolysaccharide Matrix of Pseudomonas Putida Control Biofilm Architecture and Fitness In Low-water-content Environments?	MCB	Cellular Dynamics and Function	07/15/2005	03/25/2007	Larry Halverson	IA	Iowa State University	Continuing grant	Richard Rodewald	06/30/2009	$435,001.00		larryh@iastate.edu	1138 Pearson	AMES	IA	500112207	5152945225	BIO	1114	1132, 9104, BIOT	$0.00	Intellectual Merit: Bacteria in soil and other unsaturated habitats, such as lungs or aerial surfaces of plants, generally live as aggregates of cells (biofilms) within a matrix comprised, in part, of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) of their own making. Although there is general agreement that bacteria in many environments, including aquatic biofilm communities, live within an EPS matrix, relatively little is known about the function of the EPS layer in general or even specific polysaccharide components of the matrix. One possibility that has been often discussed but has been the subject of relatively few studies is that an EPS envelope may protect bacteria from drying, thus functioning as a fitness trait in low water content habitats. Soil microorganisms mediate many critical terrestrial ecosystem processes, including global biogeochemical cycles, the degradation of organic pollutants, and beneficial and detrimental interactions with plants, yet we still have a poor understanding of how water availability influences biofilm development and metabolic activities and the survival of community members. The goal of this project is to understand the processes involved in bacterial colonization of soil and how the environment influences bacterial fitness, including the mechanisms by which environmental cues are integrated into the regulatory networks involved in adaptation to those stresses. The central hypothesis that serves as a framework for this project is that the availability of water to bacteria is a major force influencing bacterial physiology, growth, and survival. The hypotheses that will be tested are that modulation of the composition of the EPS matrix is an active process that is driven by dehydration stress and that specific EPS constituents hold substantial amounts of water thereby creating a microenvironment that slows the rate of biofilm drying, which increases bacterial survival by increasing the time for metabolic adjustment. Furthermore, stress-mediated modulation of the EPS matrix alters biofilm developmental processes and architecture, which ultimately influences the biophysical properties of the biofilm and the metabolic capabilities of community members. The objectives of the project are to: 1, identify genes involved in extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis, assess their regulation and inactivate them; 2, assess whether extracellular polysaccharides create a more hydrated microenvironment that protects biofilm cells from desiccation stress; and 3, assess the role of EPS on biofilm developmental patterns and architecture in low water content habitats.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: An important component of this research is to fill a major gap in our understanding of biofilm biology in terrestrial ecosystems, which has had to typically rely on information obtained from experimental systems that frequently don't reflect soil conditions. This project will provide multiple opportunities for research training coupled to instruction and to promote inquiry based learning strategies. Students will be challenged to identify linkages of this project to regulatory hierarchies and signal transduction pathways and to the broader implications of these growth forms on terrestrial ecosystem processes. Information will be disseminated through publications and presentations at meetings and through a website that will contain images and descriptions of unsaturated biofilm development and properties that are not available in publication format. Furthermore, the results and experimental methodologies will be incorporated into the undergraduate microbiology curriculum into new lecture and laboratory courses the PI is currently developing.

Ronnie Sircar, Princeton University<br/>Jean-Pierre Fouque, North Carolina State University<br/>Thaleia Zariphopoulou, University of Texas at Austin<br/><br/>FRG: Collaborative Research on Mathematical Methods for Defaultable Instruments <br/><br/>This project investigates problems in financial mathematics motivated by credit markets in which a major source of risk is the potential default of debtors on their payment obligations. Specifically, the problems under consideration are i) utility-indifference valuation of default risk; ii) design of instruments to optimally enhance credit worthiness; iii) asymptotic analysis of stochastic intensity models to study the time-scale content of corporate yield spreads; iv) computational issues related to the analysis of correlation between defaults across firms, modeled as large systems in interaction. The first part involves stochastic control problems related to random intensity models and infinite dimensional interest rate models. The second also overlaps and involves filtering of partially observed systems. The third uses singular and regular perturbation techniques for the class of interacting potential partial differential equations arising in this context, and the fourth uses interacting particle systems to compute probabilities which are sensitive to correlation of defaults, as well as Monte Carlo computations designed for the analysis of rare events. The intellectual merit of this project is in developing applicable scientific tools to address the particular class of optimization, design, calibration and computation issues which are essential for managing default risk.<br/><br/>Defaultable instruments, or credit-linked derivatives, are financial securities that pay their holders amounts that are contingent on the occurrence (or not) of a default event such as the bankruptcy of a firm (or a country or municipality), non-repayment of a loan or missing a mortgage payment. The market in credit-linked derivative products has grown more than seven-fold in recent years, from $170 billion outstanding notional in 1997, to almost $1400 billion through 2001. These instruments raise new challenges in modeling, analysis, computation and estimation, some of which we propose to study here by bringing together a Focused Research Group with expertise in applied mathematics, stochastic processes and computational statistics. The broader impact of the project is in deeper understanding of credit risks, which affect people from large commercial institutions to individuals with pension funds and mortgages, and designing and correctly valuing instruments to control for it. The project is also strongly geared towards training of five graduate students and one postdoctoral associate, who will benefit enormously from interaction with all parts of the broad-based group through many meetings, and in particular a large international conference on the research area at the end of the three years. The experience gained by the PI's will be reflected in their teaching of specialist graduate and undergraduate classes, and advising Senior Thesis projects in this field. As well as the closing conference, the results of the work will be disseminated through academic and industry meetings, classes and articles written for peer-reviewed journals.

The research plan is designed to scale naturally with the progressive deployment of TA stations in the western U.S, building upon initial results obtained using California regional network data. We are analyzing teleseismic earthquake waves that traverse the deep mantle in three subregions: beneath the southern U.S.-Gulf of Mexico-Central America-Caribbean, under the Central Pacific, and beneath Alaska and northern North America. Seismic methodologies that exploit the relatively dense 70-km station spacing provided by the TA data are being applied. Double-array waveform stacking, Kirchhoff scattering migration in 3D tomographic models, shear-wave splitting analysis allowing for azimuthal anisotropy, and finite frequency tomographic arrival time inversion procedures are the primary methods being applied to broadband P and S waveforms. When the initial TA deployment is completed, it will enable 5-fold increase in deep mantle spatial sampling relative to recently developed localized high resolution models for beneath the Cocos Plate and regional framework structures that we have developed. Particular effort is being focused on the mid- and deep mantle beneath Central America and the Gulf of Mexico, where there is evidence in tomographic models for tabular high velocity structures extending through the lower mantle and spreading broadly in the D Region, possibly associated with the Farallon slab and with the long history of subduction beneath North America. The velocity gradients, structural continuity, structural fabric, and spatial extent of the deep mantle structure is being examined using arrival time analysis and migration methods, with 2D and 3D synthetic modeling being used to quantify structures and to verify the reliability of the imaging procedures. Corresponding structure beneath the subduction zone under Alaska is being analyzed, and these two convergent zone regions are being compared to the isolated structure under the Central Pacific. We are assessing contributions to deep mantle structure from slab material, a post-perovskite phase transition, deep mantle dynamic flow, and partial melting. These analyses will be closely coordinated with Earthscope investigations of shallow mantle structure, incorporating corrections based on models found by others for receiver structure, lithospheric anisotropy, and upper mantle travel time variations. Our goal is to exploit USArray data to make breakthrough advances in understanding of deep mantle structure and its relationship to mid- and upper-mantle flow associated with the westward movement of the North American continent.

With colleagues at the University of Maryland, the PI has implemented a preliminary version of a data assimilation scheme that applies the Kalman filter to a sequence of local regions. In this project, the PI will spend 11 months in residence as a full-time visiting faculty member in the Department of Meteorology at the University of Maryland at College Park, where he will study atmospheric science and satellite data analysis. This visit will allow him to apply his existing skills in dynamical systems, high performance computing, and data analysis to make substantive contributions to the data assimilation project. The PI expects to develop a graduate course in data assimilation as part of the ongoing development of a graduate Certificate in Atmospheric Sciences. The latter program is an interdisciplinary collaboration between the departments of mathematics, mechanical and aerospace engineering, chemistry, geography, and physics at ASU.<br/><br/>This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).

Using concepts illustrated by the motion of a red cell moving through a tightly fitting capillary, it was shown by the PI that the drag force due to sliding friction can also be dramatically reduced if the elastic restoring force of the solid phase is small compared to the lift force generated by the transiently trapped fluid.<br/>Employing these insights, this grant explores a new concept for a future generation train which rides on a track with mechanical properties akin to goose down. Two different designs for the top porous surface of the track and the underside of the train car will be examined to determine which provides a superior sliding interface. The laboratory scale train-track model will be fully instrumented to measure the transient pressures developed in the soft porous track bed, the slope of the underside of the train car (the planing surface) as a function of its velocity and the forces and accelerations on the moving train car. A simplified theoretical model is also developed to predict the performance characteristics of the laboratory model and its full scale design. The research has exceptional potential for broad impact by integrating research and education into the curriculum. It has already piqued the interest of graduate and undergraduate students in both the mechanical and biomedical engineering departments. A 2004 paper published by the PI in Physical Evaluation Letters has also been covered by Science, Nature and nearly 60 other publications world-wide. The Discovery Channel has contacted the PIs for a demonstration of the concept and may produce a segment for the general public. The program and the novel experimental facility that is to be constructed will also be used as part of a summer enrichment program for high school students interested in science and engineering. The proposed research will also provide opportunities to outstanding undergraduates, particularly women and minorities.

Study of atmospheric gases, atmospheric chemistry, and global carbon cycle would greatly benefit from the availability of instrumentation capable of accurate, precise, and high-speed measurements of isotopic fluxes. The instrumentation will enable long-term measurement of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon with concurrent, real-time partitioning of NEE into its photosynthetic and respiratory components when coupled to existing high frequency eddy covariance (EC) micrometeorological techniques. The interdisciplinary development team includes a physicist expert in use of lasers in stable isotope analysis, an ecosystem modeler with extensive field experience, and a plant ecophysiologist specializing in leaf-level photosynthetic gas exchange. The team will expand the capabilities of a new laser-based stable carbon isotope analysis system (acronym LARA) and to perform validating field experiments. The LARA technique is based on the existence of large isotope shifts in molecular spectra, the use of fixed frequency isotopic lasers and sensitive detection via the laser optogalvanic effect. The effort will involve the participation of post doctoral associates, graduate and undergraduate students of physics, biological and environmental science and high school interns who will be trained in optical science, measurement science, biometeorology, environmental physics and ecology. Undergraduate and graduate courses taught by the faculty participants will include trips to the field site and exercises utilizing data gathered during the project.

It is hypothesized that the substrate protein induced allosteric transitions in the chaperonin GroEL vary with size, binding affinity, binding orientation of the bound protein substrate, ultimately influencing chaperonin function and mechanism. Using single particle analysis using cryo-electron microscopy, the structure of a seven-fold symmetrized GroELsubstrate protein complex at an intermediate resolution (13 angstroms) has been determined. In addition, the important allosteric molecular changes that occur in GroEL-substrate protein complexes as determined from normal mode flexible fitting analysis have been defined. To understand the variability of substrate influences on the chaperonin mechanism, unsymmetrized structures of various GroEL substrate protein complexes + ADP will be obtained using cryo-electron microscopy of single particles. The observed presence of a multitude of conformational changes in GroEL during substrate protein binding suggests that GroEL allosteric transitions are not two-state. Resolving the low resolution multiple allosteric structural states will lead to a more comprehensive structural picture of GroEL allostery. The specific classification procedures employed for the chaperonin system should enable others to employ similar methods to resolve multiple heterogeneous protein populations.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The presence of projects using single particle analysis with cryoelectron microscipy will help foster new collaborations within Kansas and will enhance the education and training of local graduate students and undergraduate students (e.g. partial training at the Scripps Research Institute). The PI, Dr. Scott Falke at William Jewel College, Edward Gogol at UMKC and David Prendergrass at the KU Edwards campus have set up opportunities for undergraduates to work on various biophysical aspects of chaperonin preparation, electron microscopy image collection and image analysis.

The Center's foci are: (1) natural resource and environmental science educational materials development; (2) dissemination, adaptation, and implementation of these materials by educators; and (3) development and implementation of professional development institutes. <br/><br/>NCSR has an established record of producing cutting-edge curriculum products that have been successfully adapted by natural resource programs across the nation. On-going evaluation of the NCSR program clearly demonstrates the positive long-term impact on faculty and their students of both the curriculum products and associated professional development. Materials being developed and disseminated include college-level courses, educator guides, laboratory and field teaching modules, and high school-level educational guides and instructional modules. Professional development activities focus on contemporary environmental science and natural resource topics and procedures germane to life sciences and advanced technical education for college faculty and secondary school educators. NCSR provides a comprehensive information and reference guide for natural resource educators on current concepts and practices in ecosystem management including Native American perspectives. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is its emphasis on addressing major challenges in sustaining natural resource environments while supporting the economic needs of a growing population. Natural resource professionals must understand ecological systems. Technicians who support production and stewardship need knowledge of the evolving complexities of ecosystem science and management techniques that can ensure sustainability of these critical resources. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project are the continued production of and increased skills and knowledge of advanced technicians nationwide. They bring to the workforce an understanding of the science and technical processes needed to rebuild and sustain our natural environment while providing economic benefit. NCSR's approach to ecosystem-based natural resource education is to: (1) emphasize seamless education from K-12 through the university; (2) work closely with employers in curriculum development; (3) develop core instructional materials that prepare students to obtain advanced knowledge and skills; (4) promote the successful use of these materials and approaches through professional development of college and secondary school faculty; and (5) produce skilled technicians who work for industry, agencies, and organizations involved with aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. This approach has proven to be effective both in creating widely adaptable curriculum products with emphasis on developing student understanding and in the use of inquiry-based science through rigorous laboratory and field-based instruction.

This outcome is the result of a departmental (and university) commitment articulated less than ten years ago to increase the numbers of minority graduate students, an effort that has attracted external support through a series of US Dept. of Education's Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) grants. The Department's success is based on: (1) a well-designed recruiting campaign to convince students that the environment is a welcome one; (2) a commitment to institutionalizing the effort; (3) and collaboration among faculty within the Department, between the Department and other components of the University as well as the Iowa state system. The Department clearly recognizes that the enrichment programs described in the proposal are of value to all graduate students, and by offering them in this way minimizes the risk of marginalizing minority students

The technology to be developed involves using mass spectrometers and heavy isotopes to measure the concentration and modifications of as many of the 30,000 different plant proteins as possible. This new technology in the field commonly known as 'proteomics' is badly needed in order to convert genomic sequence data into knowledge that represents a real understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. These measurements will be performed with specific 'knockout' mutant plants that are resistant to the effects of the plant hormone. By measuring how these mutations affect the presence of particular proteins, the handful of proteins that are specifically involved in mediating the effects of the hormone will be identified. Broader impacts of this project beyond the development of a much needed, generally applicable technology include organizing workshops for the research community in the methods that will be developed and the introduction of concepts in functional genomics into high school biology classrooms.

It has become a paradigmatic language for the programming language research community over the last twenty years. Standard ML of New Jersey is the most widely used and best supported implementation of Standard ML, and it has seen wide use in the programming language and formal methods research communities (among others) since the late 1980s. It is available as a free, open source software system with a liberal BSD-style license. To remain viable and competitive, a programming system needs to be continually maintained and improved, and the resources provided under this award will help to do this. In order to maintain and increase the value of SML/NJ to its user community, this proposal will address the following needs: (1) to keep SML/NJ in step with advancing technologies (e.g. support for 64-bit architectures, Unicode character and string types, improved interoperability with other languages, support for new operating system releases and new platforms), (2) to improve the system's performance, reliability, capabilities, and usability, both as a programming tool and as a research and education platform, and (3) to manage the open source development process (e.g. managing bug reports and fixes, integrating contributed code, testing, building releases, writing and revising documentation, etc.). In addition, the proposed equipment infrastructure, consisting of instances of supported architectures and operating systems, will help maintain the valuable diversity of platforms that SML/NJ is known for.<br/>This is awarded as a community resource. Broader impacts of this award include its wide use in research and education in the field of programming languages, and use in development of major systems.

The WAIS Divide core will be unique among Antarctic ice cores in that it will have discernable annual layers for the last 40,000 years. A critical element of the program is to determine the age of the ice so that the climate proxies measured on the core can be interpreted in terms of age, not just depth. This project will make electrical measurements that can identify the annual layers. This information will be combined with information from other investigators to develop an annually resolved timescale over the last 40,000 years. This timescale will be the foundation on which the recent climate records are interpreted. Electrical measurements will also be used to produce two-dimensional images of the ice core stratigraphy; allowing sections of the core with abnormal stratigraphy to be identified. The broader impacts of this project include exposing a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students to ice core research and assisting the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C to develop a paleoclimate/ice core display.

Klartag<br/><br/>This project explores several challenging directions in the study<br/>of high dimensional convex bodies. The unifying theme of the<br/>project is that high dimensionality, when viewed correctly, may<br/>entail simplicity and order, rather than enormous diversity which<br/>is impossible to control, the so-called ``curse of<br/>dimensionality''. In particular, the PI will address the<br/>fundamental questions regarding distribution of mass in high<br/>dimensions, the typical shape of lower-dimensional sections of a<br/>given convex set, and the interplay between convex-geometric<br/>inequalities and functional inequalities, mostly in the category<br/>of logarithmically concave functions. While classical convexity<br/>focuses on fine properties of bodies or shapes in a fixed<br/>dimension, in the asymptotic theory one views the dimension as<br/>being finite, yet tending to infinity. We aim at bridging<br/>between these two disciplines, both by applying classical tools<br/>to the study of asymptotic questions, and by drawing corollaries<br/>of a classical flavor from asymptotic results. These corollaries<br/>are often of an almost-isometric nature, not only isomorphic.<br/><br/>The study of high dimensional objects is common to various<br/>scientific disciplines, including statistical mechanics, the<br/>theory of machine learning and asymptotic combinatorics, to name<br/>a few. Connections between these areas and asymptotic convex<br/>geometry have already begun to emerge. A better understanding of<br/>the high dimensional phenomena from the geometric viewpoint has<br/>the potential to contribute to the development of the<br/>aforementioned fields and to others

This proposal aims to develop a new methodology to prepare gene therapy vectors by an electrostatic co-extrusion (ECE) process. This process would make it possible to encapsulate DNA using charge-neutral bilayers, potentially reducing the cytotoxicity of the vectors and improving the bioavailability of the DNA by not having a strong attachment of lipid to the DNA. Importantly, the encapsulation would be performed with very little loss of DNA, giving ECE a major advantage over pressure extrusion or other liposome preparation methods.<br/><br/>The specific aims of this research are to: (1) demonstrate the ability of electrostatic co-extrusion to efficiently encapsulate naked plasmid DNA, DNA condensates, and siRNA within bilayers of varied lipid composition, (2) characterize vectors created by electrostatic co-extrusion to classical techniques through the assessment of homogeneity and range in size, zeta potential, and DNA content, (3) quantify and optimize DNase resistance, serum stability, and in vitro transfection rates of vectors produced by electrostatic co-extrusion, and (4) investigate approaches that would allow this technique to be scaled up for bulk manufacturing.

Do rocks deform in the ductile regime by diffusion creep (with strain rate proportional to stress), or by dislocation creep (where doubling the stress increases strain rates ~10 times)?. Is the lower crust relatively strong, with efficient coupling of strain between the crust and mantle, or weak, as in the classic jelly sandwich model? Is the upper mantle strong, as expected for dry peridotite, or weak, due to high volatile content? Is deformation in the upper mantle localized along shear zones beneath crustal faults, or distributed, as in thin viscous sheet models?<br/><br/>This is a project that will use seismic anisotropy to measure strain in the mantle and that when combined with mineral physics, to constrain deformation mechanisms and therefore to constrain rheology. The PIs maintain that the strike-slip system in New Zealand is the best place to study these relationships because the signal is large and simple with constraints at the surface provided by geology, GPS, and known relative plate motions for the last 45 million years. Specifically the project involves: 1) Deployment of 30 Ocean Bottom Seismographs; 2) Measurement of seismic anisotropy using a variety of techniques (shear-wave splitting, surface wave dispersion, Pn and Sn travel times, and receiver functions); 3) Calculations of mantle finite strain fields that might be responsible for anisotropy, constrained by relative plate motions and observed strain in New Zealand and considering a variety of vertical and lateral distributions of temperature and deformation mechanisms; and 4) Combination of laboratory, theoretical and seismological constraints on anisotropy to bound the conditions under which dislocation creep occurs.

Mixed polymer brushes refer to monolayers of two unlikely polymers grafted to the same solid substrate. The mixed brushes grafted onto a plane of solid substrates were successfully used by the PIs to design smart and responsive surfaces which change the surface composition, interfacial energy, adhesion, adsorption, wetting behavior, etc upon external signals (solvent, pH, temperature). The mechanism of the switching/responsive behavior was shown to originate from the microphase segregation of unlikely polymers where outside conditions may strongly affect the phase segregation. In this proposal, we suggest the translation of the developed approaches into a new challenging system - spherical mixed brushes. Two unlikely polymers will be end-grafted to the same spherical nanoparticle. The spherical geometry brings new aspects to the phase segregation of the mixed brushes. Upon external stimuli, the phase separation in the spherical mixed brushes results in several characteristic morphologies: core-shell, inverse core-shell (polymers are segregated in the radial direction) and Janus-like morphology (two unlikely polymers occupy different sides of the particles). The mechanism is strongly affected by the ratio between the nanoparticles' radius and brush thickness. This new aspect will allow us to add a new parameter (particle radius) for the regulation of the response. This research will focus on the systematic study of the phase segregation mechanism in the spherical brushes in a controlled outside environment. The regulated response of the brushes will be used to regulate self-assembly of the smart particles in colloidal systems (colloidal solutions and suspensions). Formation of supra micelles upon external signal is the second target of the project. Two collaborating teams from Clarkson University and Clemson University will concentrate their expertise on the synthesis and study of the hierarchical self-assembly of spherical mixed brushes.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>The smart nanoparticles will allow for the modification of bulk properties as well as the<br/>modification of surface properties of materials. Development of this approach will be<br/>important to transform recent advances in nanoscience to industrial technologies with broad<br/>applications from nanocomposites to drug delivery systems. Another priority of the proposed<br/>project is the involvement of the brightest high school, undergraduate and graduate students in the modern surface and nanotechnology research. The project will result in the training of the students in the area of surface modification and characterization of nanostructured systems. Students will also greatly benefit from the collaboration between Clemson and Clarkson Universities. Moreover, they will be actively involved in the international research collaboration that is also planned in this project. Significant effort will be directed to increase<br/>the numbers of students, especially minorities and women, who pursue advanced degrees in science and engineering.

The study will focus on the Amundsen Sea and Pine Island Glacier, and will document how this water gains access to the continental shelf, transports heat into the ice shelf cavities via deep, glacially-scoured troughs, and rises beneath the ice to drive basal melting. The resulting seawater-meltwater mixtures upwell near the ice fronts, contributing to the formation of atypical coastal polynyas with strong geochemical signatures. Multidecadal freshening downstream is consistent with thinning ice shelves, which may be triggering changes inland, increasing the flow of grounded ice into the sea. This work will be carried out in combination with parallel modeling, remote sensing and data based projects, in an effort to narrow uncertainties about the response of West Antarctic Ice Sheet to climate change. Using state-of-the-art facilities and instruments, this work will enhance knowledge of water mass production and modification, and the understanding of interactions between the ocean circulation, sea floor and ice shelves. The data and findings will be reported to publicly accessible archives and submitted for publication in the scientific literature. The information obtained should prove invaluable for the development and validation of general circulation models, needed to predict the future role of the Antarctic Ice Sheet in sea level change.

One of the fundamental steps involved in signal transmission between the nerve cells, is the conversion of a chemical signal liberated at the end of one nerve cell, into an electrical signal at the second nerve cell. This step is mediated by a class of membrane bound proteins known as ligand gated ion channels. An important member of this family is the glutamate receptor, which upon binding to the chemical signaling molecule glutamate undergoes a series of changes that culminate in formation of an ion channel across the cell membrane that leads to the generation of an electrical signal. The PI's research is aimed at understanding the series of events and the role of these in the generation of the electrical signal. Her laboratory has probed the vibrations of the glutamate and protein to study their atomic-level environment and hence obtained detailed insight into the interaction between the signaling molecule glutamate and the receptor. The PI will now extend these investigations to study the changes in these interactions in a time-resolved manner, as the protein evolves from the unbound state to the glutamate bound form. These high-resolution kinetic structural studies coupled with functional investigations of the protein will lead to a basic understanding of the role of the specific interactions between glutamate and the receptor in the formation and closure of the transmembrane ion channels and hence provide insight into the mechanism by which these proteins convert chemical signals into electrical signals. As a part of this project the PI will be training the future scientists, students and postdoctoral fellows, in cutting edge interdisciplinary research that covers the synergistic areas of chemistry, biochemistry and neuroscience. The goal of the training is to develop the student's and fellow's technical and critical thinking and more importantly reinforce their interest in science.

An analogous background of electromagnetic origin was discovered fifty years ago, but it originated at a much later time in the evolution of the Universe. This search takes advantage of LIGO's high sensitivity at gravitational wave wavelengths that are sub-multiples of the interferometer arm length. In addition, at such wavelengths, the gravitational signal has a distinct spectral shape that can facilitate its identification in the presence of a much higher level of instrumental noise.<br/>The discovery of this effect would make possible a look at the earliest epoch of the cosmos and would drastically impact the understanding of our world. The analysis of the LIGO data to search for this effect requires algorithm development and large scale computing. This is ideal training for young scientists and students who thereby acquire skills valuable in all sectors of technology and of and its applications in our society.

Objectives have been defined to investigate the determinants of initial and longitudinal outcomes, as well as to compare Kaizen events with a more traditional improvement mechanism (continuous process improvement teams).. Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies (surveys, operational performance data, observations, document reviews, and interviews) will be used to collect data from eight manufacturers over a three-year period. We explicitly including both social and technical system outcomes and will empirically test claims that Kaizen event use will lead to the creation of a culture of continual improvement over time.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Research results will be shared with the collaborating organizations and industrial consortiums will be used to disseminate the results to a broader industrial and research community. Members of these consortiums will be able to use the research findings to design better Kaizen events, with a higher probability of successfully sustaining outcomes. Also, the research will be integrated into engineering curricula of both undergraduate and graduate courses at Oregon State University and Virginia Tech. Both PI's are actively teaching engineering courses in which lean practices and change mechanisms are explicitly covered.

Using secondary school teachers learning to use a reformed-oriented environmental science curriculum (Looking at the Environment - LATE), groups of teachers will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions. These are: (1)a traditional face-to-face workshop, (2)self-guided online professional development, or (3)online professional development guided by a facilitator and structured as a short course. The content of the professional development is held constant over the three conditions and the online aspect is based on previous research and development activities (Knowledge Networks On the Web - KNOW). Various measures are used to assess impact including: (1) teacher backgrounds and beliefs surveys, (2)written tests of teacher concept knowledge, (3)post-professional development interviews, (4)classroom observations of teachers enacting the curriculum and (5)student learning measures based on the curriculum materials.

Carmona and K. Ronnie Sircar, Princeton University<br/>Jean-Pierre Fouque, North Carolina State University<br/>Thaleia Zariphopoulou, University of Texas at Austin<br/><br/>FRG: Collaborative Research on Mathematical Methods for Defaultable Instruments <br/><br/>This project investigates problems in financial mathematics motivated by credit markets in which a major source of risk is the potential default of debtors on their payment obligations. Specifically, the problems under consideration are i) utility-indifference valuation of default risk; ii) design of instruments to optimally enhance credit worthiness; iii) asymptotic analysis of stochastic intensity models to study the time-scale content of corporate yield spreads; iv) computational issues related to the analysis of correlation between defaults across firms, modeled as large systems in interaction. The first part involves stochastic control problems related to random intensity models and infinite dimensional interest rate models. The second also overlaps and involves filtering of partially observed systems. The third uses singular and regular perturbation techniques for the class of interacting potential partial differential equations arising in this context, and the fourth uses interacting particle systems to compute probabilities which are sensitive to correlation of defaults, as well as Monte Carlo computations designed for the analysis of rare events. The intellectual merit of this project is in developing applicable scientific tools to address the particular class of optimization, design, calibration and computation issues which are essential for managing default risk.<br/><br/>Defaultable instruments, or credit-linked derivatives, are financial securities that pay their holders amounts that are contingent on the occurrence (or not) of a default event such as the bankruptcy of a firm (or a country or municipality), non-repayment of a loan or missing a mortgage payment. The market in credit-linked derivative products has grown more than seven-fold in recent years, from $170 billion outstanding notional in 1997, to almost $1400 billion through 2001. These instruments raise new challenges in modeling, analysis, computation and estimation, some of which we propose to study here by bringing together a Focused Research Group with expertise in applied mathematics, stochastic processes and computational statistics. The broader impact of the project is in deeper understanding of credit risks, which affect people from large commercial institutions to individuals with pension funds and mortgages, and designing and correctly valuing instruments to control for it. The project is also strongly geared towards training of five graduate students and one postdoctoral associate, who will benefit enormously from interaction with all parts of the broad-based group through many meetings, and in particular a large international conference on the research area at the end of the three years. The experience gained by the PI's will be reflected in their teaching of specialist graduate and undergraduate classes, and advising Senior Thesis projects in this field. As well as the closing conference, the results of the work will be disseminated through academic and industry meetings, classes and articles written for peer-reviewed journals.

With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Rilling and colleagues will conduct a series of experiments that will contribute to the young but rapidly growing field known as social cognitive neuroscience. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to monitor brain function in people engaged in genuine social interactions. This will be accomplished with a simple interactive game that has been studied for decades, the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) Game, and a computer interface that allows subjects in the MRI scanner to view and respond to a non-scanned partner's behavior. The primary goal of the project is to continue to understand the neurobiology of social cooperation and non-cooperation. This will involve experiments on the neural bases of the prosocial emotions, emotions that help to sustain and reinforce cooperation, such as camaraderie and trust. The research will also inform our knowledge of how the brain normally functions to maintain beneficial interpersonal relationships. Four experiments will be conducted that will address the following related questions: 1) Whether activation of brain reward areas in response to mutual cooperation (observed previously) is dependent on accompanying monetary gains, or whether the reward is purely social in nature; 2) Whether the neural response to mutual cooperation differs for individuals belonging to a common, unifying group vs. different groups;  3) Whether men and women differ in their neural response to mutual cooperation; 4) Whether activation during decision-making can predict subjects' cooperation; and 5) Whether using deception to achieve greater experimental control affects results. <br/><br/>Among the broader impacts of this project is the possibility that understanding how the brain normally functions to maintain beneficial interpersonal relationships will provide clues as to the location of brain system malfunctions in patients with social behavioral disorders, such as autism, conduct disorder, or sociopathy. This project can shed light on the neural correlates of camaraderie and social bonding, which can occasionally manifest themselves in socially destructive behaviors such as gang violence, warfare, genocide. <br/>

How do neutrons and protons interact among themselves in extremely isospin asymmetric systems, such as, neutron stars? How does the equation of state, i.e., a relationship among energy, density and temperature, change as a function of isospin asymmetry in neutron-rich nuclear matter? Answers to these questions have significant astrophysical ramifications for the structure of neutron stars and the dynamics of supernova explosions. However, astrophysical observations are too limited to answer these questions. Fortunately and interestingly, these questions can be studied experimentally by using nuclear reactions induced by short-lived isotope beams at the planned Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) in the USA and other competing facilities abroad. The physics associated with these experiments is currently one of the major thrusts and at the foremost front of nuclear sciences. In particular, with high energy neutron-rich beams at RIA, a transient state of nuclear matter with appreciable isospin asymmetry and compression of more than twice the saturation density of normal nuclear matter can be created. RIA will thus provide a unique opportunity to explore the nature of nucleonic matter under extreme conditions of isospin asymmetry and density. <br/>To facilitate the success of the experimental research on the isospin dependence of the in-medium nuclear effective interactions and the nuclear equation of state, I shall carry out theoretical studies on several issues important for planning experiments and interpreting data by investigating novel properties of neutron-rich matter and their manifestations in nuclear reactions induced by rare isotope beams. The major foci of my work will be on developing new models for nuclear reactions induced by radioactive beams; identifying the role of isospin degree of freedom in the reaction dynamics; determining experimental observables that can be used to extract critical information about the isospin dependence of the in-medium nuclear effective interactions; and constraining the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter.

First, a set of recently published globally-distributed 'response functions' will be transformed into a global-scale mantle model with greater detail than previously possible. Following this, geomagnetic observatory time series data will be analyzed with the goal of devising new methods to extract an even higher resolution view of mantle conductivity, particularly at frequencies where the Earth's external magnetic field is dominated by the diurnal (and harmonic) Sq (solar-quiet) magnetospheric and ionospheric electrical current systems. This promises to provide a framework to improve the spatial resolving power for future upper mantle investigations, and to improve our view of the geodynamics of the region most closely associated with plate tectonics.<br/><br/>Scientific and technical merit. The electrical conductivity of the mantle depends on temperature, composition (e.g. Fe content), state (e.g. partial melt fraction), and the presence of volatiles. Mantle conductivity primarily increases radially with depth, but a growing body of evidence indicates there is significant lateral heterogeneity in the upper and mid-mantle. A research program is proposed that will lead to significant improvements in imaging these 3-d variations, and in interpreting and understanding the geodynamic significance of global scale lateral conductivity variations. External electrical current systems in the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere (source currents), generated by variations in solar wind activity, in turn induce electrical current to flow in the Earth's interior. This is a source of signal that may be extracted in the form of electromagnetic 'response functions', which in turn contain information about the distribution of electrical conduction within the Earth's interior. Empirical orthogonal function analysis of geomagnetic observatory data simplifies the task of interpreting the configuration of the source currents, and improves the quality of the resulting response functions, which are inverted to obtain a higher resolution model of the mantle's electrical properties.<br/><br/>Broader impacts. New constraints on the 3-d structure and physical state of the Earth's deep interior are of great importance to the broad community of researchers working to understand the dynamics and evolution of the Earth. Co-registered electrical and seismic models can be used to separate temperature and compositional effects in 3-d tomographic images, and to develop equations of state relevant to deep Earth materials. A global 3-d conductivity reference model can be used to provide boundary conditions, as well as large scale context, for modeling and inversion of data from regional electromagnetic studies, such as those supported by the NSF Continental Dynamics Program, the Margins Program, and Earthscope (http://www.earthscope.org/links_pubs/index.html). A global 3-d reference model can be used by academic, government and industry groups to address the problem of contamination and biased interpretation of data in situations where the induced internal magnetic variations are a source of noise, e.g., in studies of crustal magnetization with satellite data, or long-baseline aeromagnetic data. The improved characterization of magnetospheric and ionospheric source fields, as viewed from an Earth fixed reference frame will be very useful to researchers working with satellite data, e.g., to provide improved external field corrections for modeling of the main or crustal fields, and for studies of ionospheric and magnetospheric physics. Improved characterization of source fields is essential to progress in satellite-based induction studies.

First, current and new cyclophane diimine ligands will be optimized for Ni(II) and Pd(II) based olefin polymerization catalysis. This will be done by incorporating electron-donating and withdrawing substituents into the ligands, by changing the backbone structure of the cyclophane diimines; and by introducing fluorinated phenyl rings. Next, Fe(II) and Co(II) complexes of cyclophane tridendate ligands will be explored as olefin polymerization catalysts. This part of the project aims to define any macrocyclic effects of cyclophane ligands on tridendate late transition metal catalyst systems. Finally, late transition metal complexes of the cyclophane ligands will be tested for ethylene homopolymerization and copolymerizations with polar comonomers. The polymerization properties of the complexes will be correlated to the catalyst structures. The trends observed and insights gained will guide further design of better olefin polymerization catalysts.<br/><br/>The broader impacts from the proposed activity include interdisciplinary training of students at multiple levels. Minority and women graduate and undergraduate students will be employed on this project. Additionally, it will impact the polyolefin industry, where the successful development of a commercially viable late transition metal polymerization catalyst would have a tremendous impact.

Gene expression is a temporal process and most systems in the cell are continuously regulated. New high-throughput biological techniques can generate large quantities of static and time series data. Time series experiments can be used to identify pathways and networks that are activated as a part of a biological system or in response to external stimulus. These methods hold the promise of revolutionizing molecular biology by providing a large-scale view of cellular activity. However, time series datasets also introduce many new computational challenges. In this project algorithms specifically designed for such experiments will be developed to take advantage of unique features in such data and address the unique problems they raise. This will be achieved by developing computational methods for the analysis of gene expression data and by combining different data sources using a variety of computational techniques. The educational component of this proposal will develop ways to teach and supervise computer science, biology and medical students by developing new classes at the graduate and undergraduate levels, by fostering close interactions with biologists in both research and training, and by helping develop and execute a joint PhD program in computational biology between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.

Intellectual merit <br/>Advances in the study of quantum foundations using the (consistent or decoherent) histories approach have made it possible to resolve, or at least better understand, a number of the paradoxes which have perplexed students of quantum mechanics ever since it was developed in the early twentieth century. The fruits of this work, in particular the possibility of applying probability theory to microscopic quantum systems in a consistent way, will be used to study some of the remaining conceptual difficulties of quantum theory, in particular the nature of quantum locality: are there or are there not in the quantum world nonlocal influences producing action at a distance contrary to relativity theory? In addition, consistent probabilistic ideas will be employed to elucidate the physical significance of some of the standard tools used by quantum physicists, such as density operators and POVMs, whose mathematical de nitions are clear and simple, but whose intuitive significance is often very obscure and the subject of dispute. Various problems in quantum optics, including the nature of the quantum jumps exhibited by an ion in a trap when illuminated in a suitable way by laser light, will be studied using simplified quantum models whose properties are easily calculated and thus make it possible to get to the essential ideas behind quantum processes without <br/>lengthy mathematical calculation. Finally, the nature of the weak measurements introduced by Aharonov and collaborators will be studied using POVMs and statistical correlations. <br/>The nature of quantum information, as it arises in quantum computation and quantum cryptography, will be investigated by applying ideas from standard (classical) information theory, as developed by Shannon and his successors, to the statistical correlations between microscopic quantum systems corresponding to consistent sets of probabilities generated by different types of entangled state. A special focus will be on the question of how much information of a particular type about one quantum system is present in a different system due to their statistical correlation. This will be studied both for quantum communication channels, where one is interested in correlated quantum properties at two different times, and for entangled states, where the properties are those of two different systems at the same time. The question of how entangled quantum states can be distinguished, and the nature of the statistical correlations that arise during the process of decoherence, are among the subjects to be investigated from this point of view. <br/>2. Broader impacts <br/>The research effort will contribute to the education program at Carnegie-Mellon University at both the undergraduate and graduate levels through providing research projects for students studying physics and computer science. Postdoctoral research associates will have an opportunity to sharpen their skills while participating in this research group, making them more valuable members of the scientific community. Students and postdocs will take part in an ongoing seminar series in quantum information, and occasional courses which address these subjects, both of which attract other scientists and science students living in Pittsburgh. The results of foundations research as embodied in occasional lectures and articles written for teachers, possibly even a textbook, will help improve the teaching of quantum mechanics, a subject which students always find very difficult, not least because of the conceptual confusion produced by unresolved foundations issues of the type this research is designed to clear up.

Both proton-implanted and oxidized VCSELs will be studied experimentally, following the change in spatial and spectral characteristics of the VCSEL when different kinds of optical feedback, non-polarized, polarized, and spatially filtered feedback, are applied. The goal is to find conditions, feedback level, external cavity length, feedback phase, etc., under which the VCSEL can operate with single-mode and/or single polarization even if the injection current is relatively high. The PI will also examine the route for the VCSEL to enter the regime of chaotic oscillation and compare it with the existing theoretical prediction. The broader impact of the program will be through the training of undergraduate students to work in a technically demanding field.

It expands the number of simulations in physics, creates new simulations addressing introductory chemistry, creates simulations addressing the conceptual understanding of equations in solving science problems, and further refines some existing simulations. It increases, by approximately 35, the 35 online interactive simulations that have been developed for teaching physics (http://www.colorado.edu/ physics/phet). The project produces and widely disseminates on-line supporting materials for use in undergraduate and high school science courses. The supporting materials include: guided-discovery, tutorial worksheets; a list of learning goals; materials to support in-lecture, homework, and laboratory use; assessment instruments; and other user-contributed materials. The simulations being introduced and their effectiveness are being evaluated in at least eight additional courses in physics and chemistry at the University of Colorado and a diverse set of partner institutions. The materials are being extensively tested to ensure that they are easy to use and effective at promoting deep conceptual understanding and positive attitudes about science and technology.
0443387	Facility Support: Multi-User Facility for U-Th-Pb Geochronology Utilizing a Laser-Ablation Multicollector ICPMS	EAR	INSTRUMENTATION & FACILITIES	08/01/2005	10/12/2006	George Gehrels	AZ	University of Arizona	Continuing grant	David Lambert	07/31/2008	$346,472.00	Joaquin Ruiz	ggehrels@email.arizona.edu	888 N Euclid Ave	Tucson	AZ	857194824	5206266000	GEO	1580	0000, OTHR	$0.00	EAR-0443387<br/>Gehrels<br/><br/>This award supports the development and operation of a U-Th-Pb geochronology lab (the Arizona LaserChron Center) that utilizes a multicollector ICP mass spectrometer (from GV Instruments) coupled with a 193 nm excimer laser (from New Wave Research). These instruments are capable of generating U-Th-Pb ages rapidly (40 per hour), with a precision of 2-3% (2-sigma), utilizing a beam size of 10 to 50 microns. This rapid throughput is optimal for applications that require generation of large data sets (e.g., detrital zircon provenance studies). The spatial resolution provided by laser ablation also provides a powerful tool for unraveling complex growth/disturbance histories commonly encountered in igneous and metamorphic terranes. The laboratory is presently able to routinely conduct U-Th-Pb age determinations on zircon, sphene, monazite, and monazite inclusions in garnet grains, and efforts to develop analytical methods for analysis of apatite, rutile, and xenotime are ongoing. We anticipate generating ~50,000 U-Th-Pb ages per year in support of ~50 different projects. Students are encouraged to use the facility, and funds are available to support student involvement. We also encourage use of the instrument in a classroom setting as it can be operated remotely with simultaneous displays of laser excavation and age calculation.

For some proteins, post-translational modifications have a tremendous impact on both the structure and the function of the protein. Structural regulatory control of protein function has been well established in many facets of biology and is often a key control step in signal transduction events that are essential for life, such as the response to nutrients and stresses, cell cycle progression, and proliferation. However, unexpected alterations in protein structure can be detrimental. Misfolded proteins are frequently associated with irreversible loss-of-function and disease instead of regulation. In this project, one group of proteins will be investigated for their ability to adopt a specific type of misfolded state (prion conformation) as a means of regulation. A group of prion proteins may have evolved with the intrinsic ability to produce major changes in conformation as a means of regulation of a central process essential for life: protein synthesis. Interestingly, a complex network of prion proteins may regulate protein synthesis in yeast. This research will focus on elucidating the underlying mechanistic principles of this type of regulation. The broader impact of this CAREER project will include training of undergraduate students in prion biology, as well as inclusion of under-represented minority high school students in the research project.

Newlon	10/31/2007	$160,818.00		atila.abdulkadiroglu@duke.edu	2960 Broadway	NEW YORK	NY	100276902	2128546851	SBE	1320	0000, 1045, OTHR	$0.00	Is there a fair and efficient way of allocating public schools among pupils? Can parents manipulate public school admissions processes, and are school districts able to avoid these manipulation efforts? Can school districts maintain racial and ethnic balance at schools while providing parents with choice? The theory of mechanism design attempts to provide theoretical answers to such questions by studying the design of institutions through which individuals interact. Practical mechanism design or market design, a rising field in economics, on the other hand, goes a step further and designs and implements mechanisms for complicated real-life problems. <br/><br/>This project aims to contribute to these two fields through the study of problems of allocation of<br/>student places in public schools. The project encompasses both theoretical and empirical areas of research. The first segment of this project, a collaboration with the New York City Department of Education, focuses upon the issue of controlled choice constraints in allocation and the appeal of outcomes resulting from those constraints. The problem of complementarity in this issue will be addressed through the development of a theory of fair allocation. The design of an appeals process will, importantly, yield a new class of problems involving hybrid models and consider the problem of design efficiency. Further, research on related distributive issues will add to the literature on atching.<br/>The second major segment of this project, involving collaboration with the NYC DOE and Boston Public Schools, focusses upon the design and evaluation of systems that address many of the theoretical problems discovered and discussed prior. First, an evaluation exercise for the public schools admissions process in New York will meet an increasing need to report design efforts in economics literature. Second, a major multi-year study of the Boston schools admissions process will assess the incentives and efficiency of a system that has been in place for nearly two decades through simulation exercises. The design and results of this study will represent both an end-to-end<br/>process, from mechanism design theory to its application, and will advance policy research and practice.<br/>The successful completion of the project requires a highly interdisciplinary approach, both intellectual and social, with collaboration across disciplines of economics, operations research, computer science, and public policy. The participation of policy makers within the scope of this project introduces new questions and access to rich data sets otherwise unavailable to economists; access to such data encourages collaboration across fields within economics, among theoretical economists, labor economists and econometricians. The interdisciplinary approach of this project<br/>therefore will yield the creation and maintenance of a network across disciplines and across fields.<br/>The rising field of practical mechanism design provides immense opportunity for interdisciplinary education at the undergraduate and graduate levels and for the training of practitioners and public servants. One objective is to integrate this frontier research into the economics curriculum and PhD program, with courses open to economics and engineering students that provide new research opportunities and new solution strategies by introducing the economist.s approach to well-studied engineering problems. A website dedicated to the training of public servants in school districts will be developed; it will provide a forum for issues related to school choice, offer a database of school choice plans throughout the US, and offer free software that will aid practitioners in designing dmissions processes<br/>Intellectual Merit: The expansion of knowledge on practical mechanism design would represent an important development and cross-fertilization within the discipline of economics. First, the practical mechanism design exercise introduces new theoretical problems and policy questions. The project will push the frontiers of the theory of mechanism design by studying these problems in a theoretical context. Second, the design and implementation of mechanisms in real-life markets requires a systematic study of institutional details; when these details expand beyond the boundaries of economists. analytical toolbox, it will systematically incorporate computational and<br/>experimental economics. Third, the results and the lessons derived from the design exercises will be published in scientific journals, thereby fostering the creation of a design literature, whose focus will differ significantly from the theoretical literature. Fourth, a practical mechanism design approach offers an opportunity to revisit long-standing questions with new and rich data sets. <br/>Broader Impact: This project has a direct public benefit: it will help school districts design better student assignment mechanisms. It will also enhance policy makers. understanding of factors that effect student achievement and parental preferences in school choice. The development of new theories and design of new models and processes has several other applications and extensions, including government or public-sector labor markets.

Ingber	07/31/2007	$140,000.00	John Ulicny	klingen@engr.wisc.edu	21 North Park Street	MADISON	WI	537151218	6082623822	ENG	1415, 1504	0000, OTHR	$0.00	ABSTRACT - 0424087<br/><br/>Electro- and magnetorheological (ER and MR) fluids are particulate suspensions whose rheological properties are dramatically altered by electric and magnetic fields, respectively. The applied fields also alter the suspension microstructure, causing the formation of particulate columns oriented in the field direction in quiescent suspensions, and the formation of concentrated particulate stripes oriented in the flow direction in sheared suspensions. These structural changes are intimately connected to the rheological phenomena. The formation of particulate columns is known to cause the dramatic rheological changes. The appearance of stripes is associated with the onset of a transient rheological response, where the shear stress slowly increases as the stripes coalesce, coarsen, and densify. ER and MR fluids are being exploited in the development of such applications as shock absorbers, clutches, and brakes, with MR applications recently reaching commercialization. Understanding and modeling the transient structural and rheological behavior is crucial for the design, optimization and control of ER and MR fluids and devices. <br/><br/>Particle-level simulations have been valuable for understanding the relationships between particle properties, interactions, and macroscopic behavior. However, these approaches are computationally expensive, and thus ill-suited for modeling the behavior of an entire device. Other modeling strategies must be developed to complement particle-level simulations and overcome their inherent limitations. We have developed a continuum description of the structure evolution in ER suspensions, as characterized by the time and position-dependent particle volume fraction _(x; t). The particle flux is related to the particle contribution to the stress via a momentum balance. Using this two-fluid approach, one predicts the patterns observed experimentally-column formation in quiescent suspensions, and stripe formation in sheared suspensions- without the computational expense of following the motion of individual particles. <br/><br/>Although this continuum model can successfully reproduce certain features of structure evolution, assumptions employed for the constitutive behavior limit its predictive power. Most notably, assuming a form for the electrostatic stress appropriate for an isotropic suspension precludes an estimate for the field-induced shear stress and thus the associated rheological transients; and the neglect of nonlocal polarization gives little insight into the long-time transients. The main goal of the proposed work is to combine the strengths of the two modeling approaches to obtain a multiscale description of ER/MR fluids and devices, overcoming the limitations of our prior continuum modeling effort. We will employ particle-level simulations (i.e., Stokesian dynamics simulations) to determine the appropriate constitutive behavior for particle stress and particle flux for use in the continuum model. Employing this constitutive behavior will allow us to probe both the evolution of structure and shear rheology from a continuum perspective. We will also extend a selfconsistent field model of ER fluids to model nonlocal polarization contributions in the continuum model, in order to describe the long-time transient phenomena. The proposed work will yield a complete continuum description of the rheology and mass transport in ER and MR fluids that can be used in the design, optimization and control of ER and MR fluids and devices. <br/><br/>Simulation studies will be performed by Klingenberg, Morris, and students, with continuing consultation with Ulicny at General Motors. Experiments for verification will be performed at both UW and GM. GM will also provide experimental results for clutch performance from measurements on a clutch test rig at GM.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact. The proposed work will specifically benefit the design, optimization and control of sheared ER and MR devices by providing a models for both the rheology and mass transport. Such information is necessary as particle transport appears to be ubiquitous in sheared ER and MR fluids, and impacts the apparent rheology. More generally, the proposed work will benefit suspension mechanics research as we further develop continuum methods for describing the flow of suspensions. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this work includes an educational component through the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the technical modeling aspects of this work, as well as the experimental techniques. Results from this work will be available to the scientific community through submission of manuscripts to refereed journals, and presentations at scientific meetings.

The overarching goal is to develop models that describe the interconnections among key constructs in order to reexamine the content of elementary science methods courses, mentoring for early career teachers, and professional development opportunities and coaching for teachers all along the Teacher Professional Continuum. The main constructs of interest in this five-year study are beliefs about science teaching, science content knowledge, readiness to change teaching practice, teachers' sense of efficacy in teaching inquiry-based science and transfer and fidelity to elements of professional development. CAREERS is examining these beliefs, attitudes and knowledge for 300 pre-service teachers and 500 mid-career teachers. Additionally, science teaching practice is being examined for all 300 pre-service teachers during the science methods course with a follow-up on 60 of these teachers through student teaching and 30 through their first two induction years. The science teaching practice of the 60 mid-career cooperating teachers who supervise these student teachers is also being studied. The study design provides a longitudinal view of teacher development that examines teaching effectiveness at critical transition points (i.e., from science methods through student teaching and to induction) and how eight hypothesized factors influence fidelity to methods taught in an inquiry-based methods course. A randomized study examines the influence of characteristics of cooperating teacher mentors (their degree of experience with inquiry based instructions) on continued success on the student teachers in maintaining their inquiry approach to teaching.

A number of design styles have emerged to meet related tradeoffs, including such recent advances as structured ASICs. However, a fundamental change is upon us with the impending slow-down of Moore's law in 10-15 years-the size and performance of individual transistors are not going to improve as fast as today, and competitive semiconductor products will have to use spatial resources on a chip more efficiently. Such improvements will require synergies between computer and electrical engineering, as well as large-scale mathematical and combinatorial optimization. The challenges to interconnect scaling that arise in semiconductor technology nodes below 180nm give us a glimpse of problems to come. First, interconnect delays do not improve as fast as gate delays. Therefore, in chips that started shipping two years ago, critical interconnect delay exceeds gate delay. Moreover, today interconnects occupy a much larger volume on a chip than gates, and therefore gates must be spaced further apart to facilitate routing. By mitigating capacitance between adjacent wires, unused space improves power dissipation and signal delay, while decreasing signal noise. These global effects have not been expected in the late 1990s and devalue, to a large extent, the ongoing miniaturization of CMOS transistors. In technology nodes below 65nm, wires become so slow relative to gates that they must be heavily buffered during layout, making buffers most heavily used gates. In other words, most of the gate-area is used for communication rather than for computation. Since buffer locations and densities are not known in advance, additional unused space must be left throughout the chip, and interconnect becomes even longer.<br/><br/>The scaling effects outlined above already require a rethinking of methodologies for designing circuits and systems. Logic circuits must be synthesized so as to minimize communication and interconnect rather than gate area. At the system level, global communication and global wires must be minimized. Latency can be hidden by deep pipelining, non-traditional signaling strategies and such fundamental new concepts as networks on a chip. An additional thrust of this proposal is to carry over spatial planning to much earlier stages of chip and system design than is common today. The project will develop new software tools for optimizing shapes and relative locations of large modules, and inter-module communication at the system level. Spatial planning additionally requires attention to large fixed-shape modules, e.g., embedded memories and design Intellectual Property, that are difficult to pack and may require alignment. The more futuristic part of the research will consider spatial planning and physical optimization in the context of carbon-based nano-devices, quantum dots and quantum circuits. These technologies employ radically different types of interconnect and imply different design constraints and optimization.

In the past decade, many researchers have tried to explain the large-scale patterns of collisional mountain belts, such as the Himalayas, using models of flow of partially molten mid- to lower crust. In contrast, there have been few studies of crustal flow in exhumed continental arcs. The North Cascades, Washington, is an exhumed Late Cretaceous (circa 90 million years ago) arc, which includes rocks that were once at depths of 35-40 km and are now exposed at the surface. This mountain range also displays evidence for uplift and erosion during formation of adjacent non-marine sedimentary basins in the Eocene (approximately 50-45 million years ago); these basins are filled with the eroded debris. Field-based structural study and laboratory analytical work (geochronology, petrology, microstructural analysis) are being carried out by an interdisciplinary team of geologists to determine the timing of metamorphism, partial melting, exhumation of deep crustal rocks, and basin formation and evolution in the Cascades. These studies are aimed at providing a view of the construction and collapse of a continental arc analogous to the Altiplano region of the modern Andes in Bolivia and Argentina. Much of the research is focused on the Skagit Gneiss Complex of the North Cascades. These rocks record a history of partial melting, which probably occurred during exhumation of the mountain belt. The gneiss is bounded in part by low-angle structures that resemble detachment faults. Relationships between flow of these migmatites and bounding units have not been previously studied, but can provide information about the coupling or decoupling of deep and shallow crustal processes. Kinematics of deformation are being analyzed over a range of structural depths to determine the directions and conditions of crustal flow, and whether flow occurred in a channel parallel or oblique to the edge of the North American plate boundary. Eocene basins that flank the North Cascades contain thick sedimentary sequences deposited by rivers in a system of strike-slip and normal faults. Volcanic tuffs interlayered with the sedimentary rocks facilitate dating of the time of basin initiation, and the rates of deposition. Vast swarms of Eocene dikes intrude both crystalline rocks and basins. A major goal of the mapping and dating of the dikes is to provide a record of regional deformation during exhumation of the mountain belt and basin formation. The orientation of these structures can be compared to the flow directions recorded by the migmatites. This research involves three graduate, undergraduate research assistants, and summer interns. The principal investigators are conducting a field trip to the North Cascades involving students from all three universities, and are publishing an illustrated, data-filled field guide related to the trip and the research results on the internet.

Under direction from Congress, the NSF and the Office of Science Technology Policy are facilitating a series of six workshops to address current and future research on the science and technology of security evaluations. This workshop focuses on the methodological issues related to the use of brain imaging technologies, like fMRI, to recognize deception. The workshop will bring 12 leading experts and practitioners together for two days in August 2005 at the NSF. Participants will present and discuss the results of recent brain imaging research on basic cognitive and emotional processes as they relate to the activity of deception. Both small group and large group discussions will be used to focus the ideas and experiences of the participants in outlining key issues and research questions, ultimately leading to the formation of a series of proposed research directions. Participants will also address the ethical, legal and privacy concerns of current research. A final report will be prepared summarizing presentations and views of the workshop participants and the resulting research agenda.

The methodology combines a mesh deformation and adaptation algorithm and an hp-finite element method to obtain high spatial accuracy. Multi-scale resolution is provided by using a mesh refinement criterion that detects oncoming topological change and automatically refines the mesh. To allow topology change (reconnection of fluid interfaces), a level-set formulation is used in a small spatial and temporal window around the topology change event. Once the topology change is complete, the window is removed and the high-accuracy deforming mesh simulation is continued. This approach will provide better accuracy and efficiency than previously possible for multi-fluid problems with topological change. The techniques developed can also be used with formulations such as molecular dynamics for the topological change window and thus they are the step towards a first-principles prediction of practical problems with topological change.<br/><br/>Examples of flows having topological change include wave crashing, cavitation, bubbly flows, boiling, atomization, mold-filling, liquid jets in a gas, coating flows, etc. The design of many practical devices hinges on an accurate prediction of these flows. One such example is liquid fuel injection into either jet engines or internal combustion engines. The performance of these devices is strongly dependent on the performance of the fuel injectors. (Most people are familiar with the idea of getting their automobile fuel injectors cleaned to increase efficiency and reduce pollutant production). Injectors are currently designed almost entirely using a trial and error approach because current analytical and numerical tools cannot predict the process. This investigation aims to develop a simulation technique that will provide accurate and reliable predictions of practical flows having topological change.

Statler	07/31/2010	$286,882.00	William Coles	rickett@ece.ucsd.edu	Office of Contract & Grant Admin	La Jolla	CA	920930621	8585344896	MPS	1216	0000, 1207, OTHR	$0.00	AST 0507713<br/>Rickett<br/><br/>The objectives of this project, led by Dr. Barney Rickett, are: (1) to determine the angular structure of some very compact radio sources; (2) to measure the small-scale turbulence in the interstellar plasma; and (3) to study the propagation of waves through turbulent media. These objectives<br/>are quite disparate areas of science, related by the radio scattering methods that will be employed in the work. As the radio signals from quasars and pulsars travel toward the Earth, they suffer scattering analogous to the twinkling of starlight in the Earth's atmosphere, except that the cause is fluctuations in the density of the interstellar plasma. Though this scattering hampers the direct study of the quasar or pulsar, it provides a probe of the interstellar plasma and a method of measuring very small structure in the source. In its simplest form it is based on the familiar observation that stars twinkle and planets don't - because planets have a larger angular size than stars and this smoothes out the twinkling.  The sources that will be studied with these techniques are particularly interesting for different reasons. One is the recently discovered double pulsar binary system J0737-3039. This system is a remarkable laboratory for studies of gravitational physics and pulsar magneto-spheres.  Dr. Rickett's studies will help realize the potential for gravitational and magnetospheric studies. Another class of source is the so-called intra-day variable. These are active galactic nuclei which are so compact that they must be incredibly bright, in fact so bright<br/>that they come very close to the inverse Compton limit. Dr. Rickett's studies will help determine if indeed the inverse Compton limit is violated. Some of the scattering techniques are mature and need only refinement, whereas others, such as the parabolic arcs recently discovered in pulsar spectra, have great promise but are still in their infancy. The development of these techniques is an important part of this work. This includes the development of digital simulation tools to study cases which are analytically intractable. The microstructure of the interstellar plasma is not well understood and measurements have been for the most part restricted to one dimension, but new techniques have already started to provide a two dimensional view and this will be pursued vigorously.<br/><br/>The work impacts several areas of astronomy: pulsars; gravitation; extra-galactic sources; and interstellar medium. The development of techniques, particularly digital simulations, will also have a broad impact outside astronomy, including the solar wind plasma, and wave propagation in the atmosphere and in the ocean. This award is primarily for the support of graduate and undergraduate students. The training they will receive has broad applicability in many branches of science and engineering.<br/>

It is likely that the functional understanding of fruit development genes in the model plant system of Arabidopsis will be directly transferable to crop plants, and thus this research should facilitate gene discovery in plants of agricultural importance.  Fruit size, shape, and method of seed dispersal varies markedly in different species, but the molecular and genetic basis of this diversity is completely unknown.  The central issue addressed involves the identification of the major genes that are required for normal fruit development. A number of genes that control the formation of the different parts of the fruit will be identified and these genes are important for fruit size, shape and seed dispersal.  A series of genetic and molecular approaches are proposed to identify and characterize additional genes that regulate the upstream patterning processes that control fruit development.  These studies should lead to a simple model for the action of major genes in controlling fruit development and this model should be generally applicable to many species.   This research will also provide excellent training opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellows. The resources created will be incorporated into laboratory courses and outreach efforts.

Mishkind	07/31/2007	$204,262.00		ahirsch@ucla.edu	10889 Wilshire Boulevard	LOS ANGELES	CA	900951406	3107940102	BIO	1165, 1329, 7472	9109, 9178, 9183, 9237, 9251, BIOT, SMET	$0.00	The goal of this project is to better understand attachment and infection thread formation of bacteria during the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis that occurs with legumes. The nitrogen-fixing symbiosis between bacteria of the Rhizobiaceae and legume plants involves a constant dialogue between partners that results in bacterial attachment to plant roots, the formation of infection threads through which the bacteria enter the root, and the development of the nodule on plant roots, in which the bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia that is readily assimilated by the plant. Nod factor, a bacterial signal molecule, is critical for infection thread formation and nodule development. However, some legumes differ from this paradigm. They form nitrogen-fixing associations in the absence of nodules and with bacteria other than rhizobia. Infection thread formation and invasion does not require Nod factor suggesting that other bacterial factors are important for infection thread formation and that fewer steps are required for establishment of the symbiosis. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Most bacterial-eukaryotic cell interactions involve host receptor-protein-pili interactions followed by endocytosis. This type of protein-protein interaction could mediate the non-nodulating legume symbiosis. This project will use biochemical, genetic and genomic approaches to assess the role of bacterial pili and to look for putative plant pili-binding proteins in both nodulating and non-nodulating legume symbioses. To elucidate the role of pili in attachment and infection thread formation, candidate genes involved in pili formation will be identified in rhizobial and non-rhizobial species and mutants generated to assess how the symbiosis is affected. Pili-binding proteins also will be identified in model legumes and gene disruption techniques will be employed to determine their requirement for establishment of the association.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The results of this study will provide a more concrete analysis of the earliest stages of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis in a non-nodulating legume, and will be prepared for publication in peer-reviewed journals as well as being of topic of discussion in Dr. Hirsch's undergraduate course: Chemical Communication between Plants and Other Organisms. A postdoctoral associate will be directly involved in this research as well as a Ph.D. student. In addition, a Masters degree student will be helping the postdoctoral associate; both are female Asian-Americans.

Drawing on her many years of experience with the Colorado River Indian Tribes of Arizona, Dr. Susan Penfield will direct a research team working in close collaboration with tribal members to add substantially to the existing linguistic data for two highly endangered languages spoken in this community: Mohave [estimated 35 speakers] and Chemehuevi [estimated 5-7 speakers]. This project will also address the question: How can electronic documentation be used and controlled by indigenous communities as a vehicle for language preservation? This research will define the model needed to shift more of the responsibility for indigenous language documentation to the communities where these languages are spoken. The project will focus on the video and audio documentation of conversational practices and recorded narrative in both languages, provide training for tribal members in technology-based documentation and descriptive linguistics, use collected data to construct language lessons supporting the tribes' goal of language revitalization, make digital text, audio and video databases and develop a standard set of protocols for indigenous community use in defining issues of public access related to these digital archives and databases.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project will increase the general understanding of the process video documentation for endangered languages, add to the linguistic database for Yuman [Mohave] and Southern Numic [Chemehuevi] language families, evaluate the use of technology for on-line fieldwork, provide digital archives of linguistic data for public use and generate guidelines for indigenous communities regarding public access to digitally archived tribal resources. This project builds on previous work which resulted in a handbook for tribal members titled, Technology-Enhanced Language Revitalization (Penfield, Cash Cash & Roberts, 2004). A similar handbook focused on language documentation will result from the present project. In addition, a curriculum will be developed for a course on indigenous language documentation to be offered at the American Indian Language Development Institute, held annually in Tucson, Arizona.

The scope of the proposed work includes the development<br/>of a numerical model capable of incorporating the multiple<br/>temporal and spatial scales necessary to characterize the impact<br/>of absorption-induced heating of the parametric gain media, and<br/>analysis of more tractable model equations such as the<br/>parametrically driven nonlinear Schroedinger equation coupled to<br/>the one- or two-dimensional heat equation.<br/><br/>This research is important for several reasons. The most<br/>immediate of these lies in its applicability to parametric gain<br/>devices, such as optical parametric oscillators, used for<br/>conversion of optical fields to frequencies in the far-infrared<br/>region. Such devices are very important for spectroscopic<br/>applications, including the detection of environmentally harmful<br/>agents or chemical weapons, and for military countermeasures,<br/>including jamming of infrared-based missile guidance systems.<br/>From a more theoretical standpoint, the proposed research draws<br/>from several areas that have recently made significant advances in<br/>maturity, including multiscale simulation techniques, rigorous<br/>collective coordinate reductions, and the dynamics of patterns in<br/>dissipative equations.

Apart from high-resolution surface imaging and spatially resolved chemical analysis, EBSD provides the opportunity to directly monitor local grain orientations. The proposed e-bam lithography capability allows fabrication and simultaneous characterization of novel nanostructures. With this configuration, the system is uniquely suited to the broad-based CSM materials research programs currently well established in several academic departments including Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Physics, Chemical Engineering, and Chemistry. Three examples of the extensive materials research that will be advanced by acquisition of this system include new solar materials, advanced structural steels for energy and transportation systems, and development of nanophotonic structures. Solar cell properties critically depend on the interfacial microstructures and the high-resolution SEM would provide this essential capability to evaluate microstructural development as a function of processing. Additional areas of interest involve synthesizing modulated doped electronic films, which consist of alternating stacks of oxides with an individual layer thickness on the order of 100 nm. Thermomechanical processing of sheet and plate steels offers the opportunity to modify crystallographic textures through the cross section. Assessment of microstructures with the EBSD capability, which allows direct assessment of local texture variations between grains, is critical for complete phase identification and the assessment of the effects of processing history microstructure and performance. Recent research has demonstrated novel optical properties in nanoscale metallic structures involving the interaction of photons and surface plasmons. This research leads to the development of nanophotonic structures, which will potentially allow the integration of photonic and electronic functionality on a single chip. Key to developing plasmonic structures is access to high resolution, flexible, nanoscale lithography to allow resonator structures, gratings, and nanoparticle arrays to be routinely fabricated. Acquisition of a state-of the-art scanning electron microscope system will enable the entire CSM research community, students (female/minorities) and local industrial partners to work on the forefront of newly developed materials that are critical to current and future needs of our society. <br/><br/><br/>Funding is requested for a high-resolution scanning electron microscope to do detailed patterning of materials. This system is critical for several ongoing and developing new research programs at the Colorado School of Mines, a university uniquely positioned to support the growing materials oriented research programs in the Denver and Rocky Mountain areas. The system will be the central focus of a university facility to support the broad-based materials research on campus. Our research in Materials Science and Engineering has a long history in traditional fields such as extractive metallurgy, steel processing, and ceramics and has now expanded to include a variety of advanced materials. The expanded focus on novel materials research is evident from the success of several materials oriented centers including the Advanced Steel Processing and Products Research Center, the Colorado Center for Advanced Ceramics, the Advanced Coatings and Surface Engineering Laboratory, the Center for Solar and Electronic Materials, and the Center for Fuel Cell Research. Through these centers, we are actively involved in research on a wide variety of newly developed materials including non-oxide ceramics, nanostructured materials, advanced metallic alloys, thin film coatings, fuel cell materials, photovoltaics, photonic materials, polymers, biomaterials (prosthetic implants) and advanced steels. The proposed instrument allows very detailed materials characterization, which will enable our students, faculty, and industrial partners to actively work on the forefront of advanced materials and nanostructures that are essential to current and future needs of our society; ranging from environmental issues, telecommunication and energy conservation to life sciences.

The intellectual goal of the research is to address several questions related to this structure, including its size, extent along our line of sight, and the degree of spatial and kinematic symmetry relative to the plane. This information will be used to test models for the origin of this asymmetry, which may involve a triaxial thick disk, a gravitational interaction with the Galactic bar in the disk, or the fossil remnant of a galaxy merger. The research will have broad impact through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students, and by fostering close collaboration between a research extensive university, and two primarily undergraduate institutions.

The objective of this research is to demonstrate a proof-of-principle nanopatterning process with the capability to write periodic patterns of nanometer-scale features of a variety of motives using compact table-top lasers emitting at short wavelengths, about 10 to 50 times shorter than visible light. The approach that will be pursued is multiple beam interferometric lithography. The method will exploit the coherence characteristics of these lasers to generate by interference periodic light patterns of different motives that will be used to write on photoresist. Through further processing these patterns will be transferred to substrates of interest such as ceramics or semiconductors to realize functional devices.  <br/><br/>The proposed research is significant as it promises to realize a nano-patterning scheme of unprecedented resolution thereby extending laser manufacturing to wavelengths only available until now at large synchrotron facilities.  Furthermore, it promises the realization of a versatile table-top patterning tool that could easily be integrated with other processing tools in a laboratory environment. Such tool will enable the engineering of robust templates of controlled feature size for applications such as the growth of artificially engineered nanoscale magnetic materials for data storage, and nanoscale semiconducting and sub-wavelength optical materials for lightwave technologies. It will also impact the biological sciences, by providing scaffolds to immobilize proteins, and arrange DNA strands or molecules thereby enabling novel sensing and diagnostic tools. The proposed research will also offer unique opportunities for the training of students in an innovative and forward looking nano-technology. The combined research and education opportunities of this project will greatly benefit the US nanoscience and nanotechnology initiatives, which in turn have direct impact on electronics, biology, medicine, energy storage and material science among other fields, ultimately beneficiating society.<br/>

Magnetic, gravity, swath bathymetry and multi-channel seismic data will be acquired from the southern end of the Adare Basin to the northern parts of the Northern Basin and Central Trough in the Ross Embayment. Previous surveys documented 170 km of regional extension between forty-three and twenty-six million years ago, which resulted in some seafloor spreading in the Adare Basin. However, the relationship of Adare Basin spreading to the overall extension and the southward continental basins of the Ross Embayment has not been established. This relationship is critical to understanding the tectonic evolution of East and West Antarctica and linking Pacific plate motions to the rest of the world. The study will also offer unique insight into rifting processes by studying the transition of rifting between oceanic and continental lithosphere. In terms of broader impacts, this project will support two graduate students and field research experience for undergraduates. The project also involves cooperation between scientists from the US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.

The physical feeling is that the tagged particle is in some scale a type of homogenized random walk or Brownian motion with parameters reflecting system interactions. This picture to first order in terms of the law of averages has been established. Also, to some extent, under equilibrium conditions, second order features such as fluctuations have been understood. But less is known in non-equilibrium situations. In this context, the specific proposed work is to characterize the non-equilibrium fluctuations in certain mean-zero simple exclusion and zero-range systems where some calculation is possible. Resolution of these issues will also have some bearing on non-equilibrium fluctuations of hydrodynamic limits which is as well an open problem.<br/><br/>Informally, the proposed project is to investigate some asymptotic behaviors of a distinguished, or tagged component interacting with others in certain models of traffic, queuing and fluids. More specifically, the proposed work is to study non-equilibrium fluctuations of such tagged components. The broader impacts of the proposal are in its connections with statistical physics where determining tagged component behavior is important to understanding transport, and multi-scale phenomena.

Redepenning and Bernard Doudin of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop chemically modified nano-electrodes to be used in magnetoelectronic devices, such as permanent memories, reconfigurable logics, and fast electronic components. To accomplish this goal, the investigators plan to explore two types of barriers and to reduce the size of the junctions. One will be comprised of silicon oxide produced by repetitive hydrolysis/condensation of tetramethylorthosilicate on the surfaces of the electrodes. A second class of junctions will be produced by irreversible polymerization of appropriate metal complexes onto the surfaces in the junction. The idea is to passivate the surfaces of magnetoresistance tunnel junctions while introducing thin dielectric materials with controllable properties. The goal is to understand the elusive properties of barriers and how resonant tunneling effects occur.<br/>The discovery of giant magneto-resistance led to commercial devices such as hard-disk read heads, magnetic field sensors and magnetic memory chips. Tunnel magneto-resistance devices are another example of development from laboratory proof of principle to industrial applications within a remarkably short time. Future generations of magnetic sensors and memory elements are likely to be be constructed in the nano-scale. Understanding magnetoresistance properties at the nanoscale will help build the knowledge base required for future device miniaturization. This research will involve graduate students, undergraduate students, and high-school teachers, giving them complementary and interdisciplinary education in nanotechnology. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will create new synergies between chemists and physicists.

During sexual maturation, levels of sex steroids are elevated in trout and salmon, and androgens (testosterone and 11-ketostesterone) selectively promote growth of the heart in male rainbow trout. The investigators recently demonstrated that sex steroids rapidly (10-15 min) increase contractile strength of the rainbow trout heart, in a sex-dependent manner. However, the mechanisms responsible for this effect have not been defined. Contraction of the heart is a complex process, involving many cellular systems, and this process relates directly to fish health and swimming performance. Specific objectives for this interdisciplinary project are to: 1) characterize sex-specific steroid binding to hormone receptors in cardiac cells; 2) identify whether sex steroids selectively promote the metabolism of carbohydrate and energy production to support contractile function; 3) characterize the effects of steroids on calcium storage and release within cardiac muscle cells; and 4) measure heart function and swimming abilities of fish receiving sex steroids at levels present during spawning periods. Trout and salmon are extremely important in the Pacific Northwest, in terms of aquatic ecology, Native American culture, and economic interests. Thus, this project will be of interest to various scientists, regional Native American tribes, and the fish farming industry. The project is also designed to provide students, including those from underrepresented groups, the opportunity to participate in research activities, enhancing their own scientific education and experience. Ultimately, the results may improve environmental management of wild trout and promote a better understanding of vertebrate cardiac function.

For example, various types of endoscopes are used for colonoscopy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, enteroscopy, bronchoscopy, and cystoscopy. In addition, a rapidly expanding number of formerly open surgical procedures now are being converted to endoscopic procedures including resection of gallbladders, retrieval of donor kidneys, resection of tumors of colon and pancreas, correction of hiatal hernias, coronary artery bypass grafting and minimal invasive neurosurgeries. Despite a large body of knowledge in medical image analysis, endoscopy videos are not systematically captured for real-time or post-procedure reviews and analyses. They are recorded occasionally to magnetic video-tapes (i.e., VHS). No hardware and software tools have been developed to capture, analyze, and provide user-friendly and efficient access to the medical, scientific, or educational content on such videos. This project aims to develop an Endoscopic Multimedia Information System (EMIS) to capture high quality endoscopy videos, analyze the captured videos, and provide efficient access to the content of these videos.<br/><br/>Images of endoscopy videos significantly differ from medical still images as studied<br/>in the literature of medical image processing. The project will develop a new capturing system for endoscopy videos designed for patient's privacy and is non-disruptive to endoscopic procedures<br/>and non-restrictive to a particular endoscope vendor. New algorithms for automatic classification of informative and non-informative frames. The technique does not need any predefined parameters or thresholds. New algorithms for automatic content analysis for protruding lesions such aspolyps. Many protruding lesions are clustered together. A new region segmentation technique that can identify isolated lesions will be developed first. To handle clustered<br/>lesions, algorithms using a region pattern graph that captures important characteristics of relevant regions will be developed..<br/><br/>The proposed system will directly benefit endoscopic research, education, and training. Contributions to research-based training of graduate students who will contribute to research-based advanced training of students in graduate and undergraduate programs in computer science and medical informatics at PI and CoPI's institutions. The project will contribute to training of a new generation of computer scientists with a unique skill set supplement to traditional<br/>medical imaging. This research will enhance research opportunities for junior high and high school students participating in various university programs (UTA Summer Science Camp, Program for Women in Science and Engineering) and national programs. (4) Broaden the participation of under-represented groups.

Recently, a class of algorithms has been proposed to<br/>approximate the Fourier transform, with provable quality guarantees,<br/>in dramatically less time than required by traditional exact<br/>algorithms. The investigator and his colleagues evaluate competing<br/>variations of the algorithm, both proposed and new, and choose the<br/>best from among them for general purpose use as well as for specific<br/>application to Magnetic Resonence Imaging and solution of partial<br/>differential equations, including advection-diffusion equations.<br/><br/>The Fourier Transform is a fundamental technique with many<br/>applications. The investigator and his team investigate recent<br/>approximate methods that are dramatically more efficient than<br/>traditional methods. The team directly addresses applications to<br/>biomedical Magnetic Resonance Imaging and the modeling of liquid and<br/>gas behavior, which has further applications to studying the<br/>atmosphere and bodies of water in the environment, as well as<br/>applications to manufacturing. The investigator and his team also<br/>make available fundamental tools that will be useful to others in a<br/>broad range of scientific, educational, and engineering settings<br/>including modeling the interactions of tiny particles, reliable<br/>telecommunications, and imaging generally. The project combines<br/>cutting-edge techniques from several disciplines and trains a graduate<br/>student in these techniques and their integration.

Specifically, counts of globular cluster stars (i.e., luminosity functions) will be<br/>employed to determine evolutionary timescales. Also, internally-consistent photometry will be<br/>measured to compare stellar properties (luminosity, temperature) at different phases of evolution<br/>and at the same points of evolution across different clusters. Three aspects of the cluster colormagnitude<br/>diagrams will be examined: 1) The epoch of red giant branch ascent, including red giant<br/>evolutionary timescales, the red giant branch bump (its luminosity and sharpness), and the<br/>location of the red giant branch-tip; 2) horizontal branch and asymptotic giant branch morphologies,<br/>distributions, and evolution; and 3) blue stragglers and their radial distributions, distributions on the<br/>cluster color magnitude diagrams, and the presence of unusual blue straggler populations. The<br/>statistical nature of these investigations requires quality photometry of large samples of cluster stars<br/>which will be extracted from previously obtained wide field (for cluster outskirts) and high<br/>resolution (for cluster cores) images obtained at national and international observatories telescopes<br/>(plus archival images, including the Hubble Space Telescope where possible). Novel (within the<br/>astronomical community) statistics will also be employed in the analysis to assess<br/>significance/confidence levels of trends and relations.<br/>Undergraduate and Master's students at San Diego will be heavily involved in this work - both with<br/>the reduction and analysis of the astronomical data and the application of advanced statistical<br/>methods. The training of a graduate student at UCSC is also supported here. The final photometry<br/>will also be made publicly available.

Quantum mechanical calculations will be used to determine metal-molecule bond energies and geometries. A database of metal-organic interactions will be constructed from the integrated experimental and theoretical results, and general guidelines for the design and construction of metallic contacts to SAMs and other thin organic surfaces will be formulated. <br/>The idea is to develop simple and reliable techniques to form metallic interconnects to organic thin films in two- and three-dimensions. The production of stable metallic contacts to thin organic films is critical to many strategic technologies including polymer light emitting diodes and molecular electronics.

The principal investigators are Ursula Sheppard, University of New Mexico (UNM), and A. Joshua Leffler, Louisiana Tech University. In Australia, two CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation) facilities (Darwin and Atherton) and the Lizard Island Research Station, which is part of the Australia Museum, will host the students. Fourteen undergraduates and one graduate student from UNM and Louisiana Tech will spend one month in the summer of 2006 engaged in field research and visits to various ecosystems, including subtropical rain forest, tropical savanna, tropical rain forest, and barrier-reef islands. This award builds on and expands upon two earlier grants from the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering that supported a summer institute for U.S. students in Australia. This new award supports a field research program that teaches the scientific process, ecological research techniques, and natural history in Australia. It will focus on training students in biodiversity assessment and conservation.<br/><br/>The goal of this program is to prepare students for future research endeavors by teaching the research process from conception to publication. This goal will be accomplished by starting students on projects specifically directed by faculty, who will teach techniques related to field ecology and biodiversity. Students will then progress to more complex projects designed around specific questions in biodiversity. Finally, students will design, conduct, analyze, write up, and present a final project of their choosing. Students will also learn about tropical flora and fauna and various conservation projects. The program targets undergraduates early in their academic career, students who are unlikely to have the opportunity to do field research abroad, and biology and other majors.

Main St, Suite 710	Durham	NC	277054010	9196843030	SBE	1392	9179, SMET	$0.00	Most vertebrates possess some overlap of the right and left visual fields. The region of overlap, the binocular field, contains unique visual cues that provide an accurate estimate of distance and three-dimensional shape. The fact that animal's might use these cues to guide behavior has several interesting implications to the study of primate evolution. While there is an abundance of data suggesting that many animals perceive binocular cues, there is little evidence demonstrating binocular information is advantageous during ecologically relevant behaviors. Determining the conditions under which binocular cues are useful will be a first step in answering why most animals have binocular vision and why primates in particular have such a wide region of overlap. This project tests whether binocular information is more useful for grasping than reaching, and whether biocular cues are only useful in tasks requiring a high degree of precision. Kinematic analyses will be used to evaluate the effect of removing binocular cues on the locomotion of two primates, two marsupials, and two carnivorans in three conditions, simple locomotion, precision reaching, and precision grasping. These kinematic data will be used to evaluate the praxic hypothesis, the idea that the binocular field is correlated with the region of space over which animals make visually guided movements. The praxis hypothesis has the potential to relate eye orientation to behavioral ecology in a diverse array of species. More specifically, it provides a proximate explanation for theories of primate origins such as the nocturnal visual predation hypothesis and fine-branch arboreal hypothesis.<br/>In addition to its importance for studies of primate evolution this project will have a more general societal impact. It will encourage undergraduate participation in science by involving Duke students in data collection and analysis. Additionally, the results of this project will be included in teaching at both an academic level through college courses and public education at local schools and science museums.

Brooks to work with Dr. Luca Bottura at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.<br/><br/>Obstacles in design, realization, and performance of a magnetic measurement system are of great interest in areas of magnetic applications and applied superconductivity. Specifically, the need to measure magnetic fields faster and more accurately is a necessity. Rotating coil systems are one of the most accurate methods of field measurement in certain applications. But, due to the added complexity of mechanical rotation, the method is not the speediest. He proposes to improve upon previous rotating coil measurements systems. The fundamental objective will be to increase the speed at which these measurements can be made, without degrading the accuracy. This is important for measuring fields that change rapidly. As an approach to achieving this objective, the investigation will entail both the measurement instrumentation and the necessary electromechanical system. One of the most prominent areas of research in magnetic fields is their use in particle accelerators for physics research. CERN has started a vigorous research and development program for its next and greatest accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC superconducting magnets require extensive testing at CERN to verify their performance before commissioning. One of the main tests is the magnetic field quality test, for which a rotating coil measurement system is utilized. Also, due to the stringent magnet performance required for the LHC, these magnets have to be operated with high accuracy. Therefore, Dr. Luca Bottura has<br/>started a conceptual design of a Reference Magnet System (RMS) to aid in optimally controlling the LHC. This system requires a new and improved rotating coil system. This project will be a major enhancement of the facilities at CERN and the new rotating coil system will be the next evolutionary step in accelerator magnet measurement. By means of the CERN accelerator school, which provides papers and tutorials on accelerator topics, other institutions will leverage our work to advance their systems. These improvements in accelerator magnet performance are<br/>necessary for the particle physic experiments at these facilities, so that science can be exploited for the betterment of society.

The first<br/>two days will be devoted to a symposium that will be open to the scientific<br/>community. There will be four sessions: (1) Neurobiological Basis of Social<br/>Behavior; (2) Fear and Anxiety; (3) Sleeping and Dreaming; (4) The Aging<br/>Brain. The speakers represent a balance of species used (invertebrates to<br/>mammals), experimental approaches used (from molecular and cellular to<br/>behavioral levels of analyses), gender, and career level. The third day of<br/>the meeting will be devoted to a workshop of speakers and invited conference<br/>participants, where they will explore ways in which information discussed<br/>during the symposium can be used to take their respective research areas in<br/>new directions. This conference aims to: Bring together researchers who are<br/>asking similar questions, but are using different species and different<br/>experimental approaches; Promote the use of simple systems for addressing<br/>complex biological problems; Promote interaction between junior scientists -<br/>women in particular - and established investigators and leaders in the<br/>field; Provide a high-quality educational forum, in an intimate setting,<br/>that is conducive for in-depth discussion and learning between trainees and<br/>more senior researchers. A Meet-the-Speaker luncheon is aimed specifically<br/>at trainees, giving them the unique opportunity to interact with<br/>internationally recognized experts in an intimate setting. A Poster Session<br/>also gives trainees and more senior researchers the opportunity to highlight<br/>and discuss their own work. The speakers use modern, cutting-edge<br/>technologies for addressing problems in the area of Neural Control of<br/>Behavior. By bringing together these researchers, and giving them a forum<br/>for discussing their work, the message can be effectively spread that these<br/>modern techniques are being used with great success in a wide variety of<br/>animal systems. This conference will provide an important interdisciplinary<br/>communications-mechanism for advancements in the neuroscience community.
0524602	QnTM: Efficient Synthesis of Quantum Logic Circuits by Rotation-Based Quantum Operators and Unitary Functional Bi-Decomposition	CCF	QuBIC	08/01/2005	07/25/2005	Massoud Pedram	CA	University of Southern California	Standard Grant	Pinaki Mazumder	07/31/2006	$49,998.00		pedram@usc.edu	University Park	Los Angeles	CA	900890001	2137407762	CSE	1708	7203, 9184, BIOT	$0.00	Current-day electronic computers are not fundamentally different from purely mechanical computers: the operation of either can be described fully in terms of classical physics. By contrast, computers could in principle be built to profit from actual quantum phenomena that have no classical analogue, such as entanglement and interference, sometimes providing exponential speed-up compared with classical computers. Every quantum algorithm requires the implementation of a quantum oracle (logic circuit), whose function is to recognize solutions to a given problem. To completely exploit the quantum parallelism, this oracle should be realized by using quantum gates because it must be able to handle an arbitrary superposition of basis vectors (quantum states.) A key problem is thus how to construct a minimum-cost realization of this kind of quantum logic circuit. This research focuses on the development of an efficient synthesis framework for quantum logic circuits. The proposed synthesis algorithm and flow can generate a quantum circuit using the most basic quantum operators, i.e., the rotation and controlled-rotation primitives in the Bloch Sphere Representation. More importantly, this work introduces the notion of quantum factored forms, and develops a canonical and concise representation of quantum logic circuits, called a quantum decision diagram (QDD). The QDDs are amenable to efficient manipulation and optimization including recursive unitary functional bidecomposition. Subsequently, an effective QDD-based algorithm is developed and applied to automatic synthesis of quantum logic circuits. If successful, this research will pave the way toward building quantum computing circuits and eventually systems. Its impacts can thus be broad and substantial.
0406446	The Faddeev Knots and the Skyrme Solitons	DMS	GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS	08/01/2005	07/29/2005	Yisong Yang	NY	Polytechnic University of New York	Standard Grant	Christopher W. Stark	07/31/2008	$124,000.00		yyang@duke.poly.edu	15 Metrotech Center	Brooklyn	NY	112013826	7182603360	MPS	1265	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Abstract<br/><br/>Award: DMS-0406446<br/>Principal Investigator: Yisong Yang<br/><br/>This project is to develop a general existence theory for the<br/>knotted solitons arising in Faddeev's quantum field theory<br/>model. The difficult structure of the problem requires innovative<br/>techniques and ideas beyond the well developed tools such as the<br/>method of concentration-compactness. Recently, the PI has<br/>collaborated with F. H. Lin on the existence of these Faddeev<br/>knots and a series of important results have been obtained. A<br/>notable feature in their study is that, although compactness may<br/>fail, existence may be achieved as a consequence of two key<br/>inequalities: the first inequality, called by them the<br/>Substantial Inequality, ensures the existence of at least one<br/>topological minimizer; the second inequality, giving an optimal<br/>sublinear upper growth estimate for the Faddeev energy in terms<br/>of the associated topological charge, implies the existence of an<br/>infinite family of topological minimizers, hence the existence of<br/>the Faddeev knots. This progress opens new directions for<br/>achieving a higher level of understanding of various unsettled<br/>aspects of the Faddeev knots, including the existence of<br/>unit-charge unknots (ring-like solitons), existence of<br/>high-charge knots and their stability, and transition pictures of<br/>knots in view of their topological and energetical<br/>characteristics. The similarity between the Faddeev energy and<br/>the Skyrme energy may be exploited to tackle the difficult<br/>existence problem of the Skyrme solitons. Indeed, a by-product of<br/>the work of F. H. Lin and the PI will be a proof of the<br/>existence of unit-charge Skyrme solitons which corrects the<br/>flawed (but well-known) proof of M. Esteban published in 1986.<br/>This study may also be extended to the Skyrme model in two<br/>spatial dimensions which has applications in condensed matter<br/>physics and cosmology. This project also suggests new directions<br/>for the study of the existence problems of global energy<br/>minimizers with topological characteristics in other important<br/>related areas.<br/><br/>The concept of knots is of foundational importance in<br/>science. For example, Lord Kelvin first explored the idea of<br/>using knots to model atoms and molecules. More recently, the<br/>concept of knots has inspired various fundamental areas,<br/>including particle and condensed-matter physics, statistical<br/>mechanics, cosmology, molecular biology, and synthetic chemistry.<br/>Up until recently, mathematical work had been focused on<br/>topological and combinatorial classifications of knots, but not<br/>on existence. In 1995, Faddeev and Niemi started a seminal study<br/>on the existence of knots as the soliton solutions of a quantum<br/>field theory model known as the Faddeev model using high-power<br/>computer simulations. The proposed work develops a mathematical<br/>existence theory of such knots. This work will give new insight<br/>into the mathematical structure of knots and their computer<br/>realization.

University Blvd.	Denver	CO	802104711	3038712000	ENG	1491	9181, BIOT	$0.00	Lengsfeld<br/>0433810<br/><br/>This proposal was an unsolicited submission. This proposal aims to develop a new methodology to prepare gene therapy vectors by an electrostatic co-extrusion (ECE) process. This process would make it possible to encapsulate DNA using charge-neutral bilayers, potentially reducing the cytotoxicity of the vectors and improving the bioavailability of the DNA by not having a strong attachment of lipid to the DNA. Importantly, the encapsulation would be performed with very little loss of DNA, giving ECE a major advantage over pressure extrusion or other liposome preparation methods.<br/><br/>The specific aims of this research are to: (1) demonstrate the ability of electrostatic co-extrusion to efficiently encapsulate naked plasmid DNA, DNA condensates, and siRNA within bilayers of varied lipid composition, (2) characterize vectors created by electrostatic co-extrusion to classical techniques through the assessment of homogeneity and range in size, zeta potential, and DNA content, (3) quantify and optimize DNase resistance, serum stability, and in vitro transfection rates of vectors produced by electrostatic co-extrusion, and (4) investigate approaches that would allow this technique to be scaled up for bulk manufacturing.

The symposium is part of a series of symposia held over the past 10 years at ISU in the areas of Growth Factor and Signal Transduction. The purpose of the symposium is to gather together a wide variety of researchers involved in investigation of genome structure/function using molecular and computational biology tools, and statistical methods. With recent, rapid advancements in genome sequences of many vertebrates, the time is appropriate for more broad comparative approaches in the study of genome structure and function. The PIs have recruited 18 outstanding researchers in functional genomic analyses for the plenary addresses including four well-regarded female investigators. This symposium will open up discussion of current research in this field and will help to focus attention on important new directions for future research. There will be plenary talks, a poster session for associated work to be presented and time allotted for informal discussion sessions and workshops. A significant effort is outlined to include participation of students from under-represented groups. The university will use its connections with New Mexico State University and with the Minorities in Agriculture, Natural Resources and Related Sciences (MANRRS) to ensure minority student involvement. Travel grants funded in part by this award will be available to students and junior faculty with special efforts made to support applicants from under-represented groups. Funds from this grant also will be used to defray travel costs for invited speakers.

This study will use high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations to analyze the absorption by carbon, silicon, oxygen, and nitrogen ions in a sample of high-quality quasar spectra covering redshifts two to five. This will yield metallicities, relative abundances, and their scatter, as a function of density and red shift, which will constrain the shape and evolution of the ultraviolet ionizing background radiation, the initial mass function, and the type of source responsible for the enrichment. Observed absorptions will be compared directly to realistic spectra from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, both to test those simulations, and to constrain the effect of feedback on the IGM, the role of red shift-four galaxies in the enrichment of the IGM, and the allowed presence of metals in warm and hot gas.<br/><br/>As well as stringently testing cosmological simulations, the basis for a vast array of theoretical work, this research will develop broadly useful tools, train students, and afford ample opportunities for public talks and other educational outreach.

Merton's theories, his ideas on the relations of theory and research, and on the sociology of science. Robert Merton has left beyond an extraordinary legacy of sociological work, both published and unpublished. His work has addressed a number of contemporary issues such as the relationship between (1) basic and applied research, (2) theory and empirical research, (3) history and systematics of theory, and (4) institutional and cultural contexts of knowledge production and the knowledge produced. The workshop, however, will address primarily (a) the relationship of theory to empirical research, and (b) the relationship between sociological theory and the sociology of science. The goal of the conference and the resultant book is to provide a scientific inquiry into the current state of the sociological projects to which Merton was key contributor. The later included both specific subfields, such as social psychology and the sociologies of science, deviance, bureaucracy, communications; and the broader projects of developing theories of the middle range which relate closely to empirical inquiries. Scholars will be invited as participants, but the PI will invite submissions for participation. <br/><br/> The conference will be the basis for an edited book. The preliminary proceedings of the conference will be made available as part of a website on the work of Robert Merton. This includes a compilation of the memorials written after Merton's death, other assessments of his work, a critical bibliography, and guidance for students. Arrangements have been made to include tapes of Professor Merton, and of the ASA Memorial for Professor Merton, and to contain a preliminary guide to the Merton archives that are being established at Columbia. It is expected that a variety of other sites will to post links to this site (which will be hosted at the Social Science Research Council that operates one of the most active and frequently visited websites in social science).

Boyer and Krzysztof Galicki<br/><br/>Professors Boyer and Galicki propose to investigate several<br/>projects in geometry and topology. The objective of all the<br/>projects is to study fundamental questions in Riemannian Geometry<br/>with two main focal points: Contact Geometry of orbifold bundles<br/>over Calabi-Yau and Fano varieties and the existence of some<br/>special (i.e., Einstein, positive Ricci curvature, transversely<br/>Calabi-Yau) metrics on such spaces. The questions and problems<br/>proposed here are deeply rooted in the principal investigators'<br/>earlier work which exploited a fundamental relationship between<br/>contact geometry of Sasakian-Einstein spaces and two kinds of<br/>Kaehler geometry, namely Q-factorial Fano varieties with<br/>Kaehler-Einstein orbifold metrics with positive scalar curvature,<br/>and Calabi-Yau manifolds with their Kaehler Ricci-flat<br/>metrics. Most recently the principal investigators and J. Kollar<br/>have solved an open problem in Riemannian geometry. We have<br/>proved the existence of Einstein metrics on exotic spheres in a<br/>paper to appear in the Annals of Mathematics. Furthermore, we<br/>have shown that odd dimensional homotopy spheres that bound<br/>parallelizable manifolds admit an enormous number of Einstein<br/>metrics. In fact, the number of deformation classes as well as<br/>the number of moduli of Sasakian-Einstein metrics grow double<br/>exponentially with dimension. The techniques used by the<br/>principal investigators borrow from several different fields; the<br/>algebraic geometry of Mori theory and intersection theory, the<br/>analysis of the Calabi Conjecture, and finally the classical<br/>differential topology of links of isolated hypersurface<br/>singularities. These methods can be extended much further and in<br/>various directions. More generally the principal investigators<br/>want to address several classification problems concerning<br/>compact Sasakian-Einstein manifolds in dimensions 5 and 7. These<br/>two dimensions are important for two separate reasons. In view<br/>of earlier work higher dimensional examples can be constructed<br/>using the join construction. At the same time these two odd<br/>dimensions appear to play special role in Superstring Theory. In<br/>the context of recent developements in String and M-Theory the<br/>principal investigators also propose to investigate some related<br/>problems concerning self-dual Einstein metrics in dimension 4.<br/><br/>Mathematics is the foundation upon which our modern technology is<br/>built, and much of its understanding and development must preceed<br/>technological progress. Nevertheless, our research into a<br/>particular type of geometry is closely linked to some important<br/>problems in modern Theoretical Physics and should provide an<br/>important mathematical basis for their understanding. For<br/>example, the mathematical models that we are studying are<br/>currently being used in supersymmetric string theory which is a<br/>model for the unification of gravity with the other fundamental<br/>forces of nature. This also has applications to the Physics of<br/>black holes.

This technology is readily adaptable to a compact module configuration which can, in turn, be integrated into large arrays of millimeter wave receivers. Such array cameras can support a wide range of science, including observations of the cosmic microwave background, Galactic molecular line emission, and redshifted molecular lines in distant galaxies. A recent innovation from this group was to adapt millimeter-wave receiver architectures to integrated circuit style plug-in and surface mount carriers, which are fully compatible with automated capabilities found in the semiconductor industry. This project will develop new cryogenic detectors at 90GHz and an integrated heterodyne receiver, and will demonstrate the basic feasibility of mass production. Any developed modules will be available for demonstration at an observatory.<br/><br/>These technologies have application outside radio astronomy, such as for remote sensing and telecommunications.

The P.I. will prove two major results:<br/>the first is the existence of solutions to the equations of isentropic gas dynamics with large data (including the vacuum), and the second is the construction of time-periodic shockless solutions of the Euler equations of gas dynamics.<br/><br/>This project extends mature results for solutions having small data to the physically in-<br/>teresting regime of large data, and makes accessible many fundamental questions for systems with large data. These include the structure of solutions, decay, uniqueness and continuous dependence, and convergence of viscous and/or relaxation approximations. Moreover, the periodic solutions developed here contain a number of new features not previously known in hyperbolic systems, such as a group velocity, sustainability of solutions, and soliton-like traveling waves. The results of this project also raise challenging questions for numerical analysts and experimentalists.

Lowry at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>This research examines the regulation of neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral components of the stress response by serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) actions in the rat dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), a nodal structure in the neural circuits mediating physiological and behavioral responses to stress. The project has two primary objectives, 1) to determine the effects of increases in extracellular 5-HT concentrations in the DMH on neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stress and 2) to investigate the effects of the manipulations described above on signaling within neural circuits mediating physiological and behavioral aspects of the response to <br/>stress. The Pis will examine regulation of the magnitude and duration of the acute stress response. This is a fundamental question in vertebrate stress physiology, and has implications for human health, as insufficient control of the stress response has been implicated in human physiological and behavioral disorders, including hypertension, asthma, panic disorder, and major depression. <br/><br/>These studies will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Lowry, an international expert on the neuroanatomy of brain serotonergic systems and their roles in the regulation of <br/>behavioral responses to stress.

The fundamental and unique characteristic of the equipment is the capability of measuring 3D dynamic motions of nano-, micro- and meso-scale structures under varying environmental conditions with unparalleled accuracy, frequency span, speed, and simplicity of operation. As such, the proposed equipment enables transferring full capability of vibration and modal testing from macro- to micro/nano-scale systems, and facilitates experimental investigations and model validation activities for micro/nano-dynamics, including multi-physics phenomena. <br/>The equipment can be utilized in multiple disciplines, including nanotechnology systems, micro/nano-robotics, biomechanics, micro/nano-manufacturing, and MEMS/LIGA systems. The projects enabled by the use of this equipment, such as determination of elastic properties of nanotubes from dynamic experimentation, and assessing biological changes to cells by the changes in dynamic response, exploit applications to new horizons not seen to date. <br/>By introducing the equipment in undergraduate and graduate courses, and by extensively using it for innovative, student-centered research projects, the PIs will significantly advance the understanding and research education of micro/nano-scale phenomena. We hope to excite and attract the students from underrepresented groups by publicizing the use of the proposed state-of-the-art equipment for research and education. Each project enabled by the equipment will include both graduate and undergraduate students to enhance their research experience and expertise on micro/nano-scale phenomena. The equipment, including creative applications, will be announced to industry, government and academia (internally and externally) using newsletters, a dedicated webpage, personal contacts, seminars and conferences. We believe the equipment will be pivotal in transforming the micro- and nano-scale systems and associated phenomena to commercial products to obtain cleaner environment, more efficient products, and significantly enhanced capabilities in the areas of communications, data storage, sensors, biotechnology, medical, defense, and consumer products.

Bennett in the Chemistry Department at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee will acquire an ultrahigh vacuum atomic force microscope (AFM). The instrument will be used primarily for two projects: a) the measurement of frictional properties of thin films that will allow nano-tribological measurements to be related to the properties of realistic contact geometries; b) investigations on the electrical properties of linked oligomers of aryl isocyanides to determine their potential as molecular wires. Other projects include studies on gate insulators for MOS devices and single-molecule fluorescence studies. <br/><br/>Chemistry is a scientific discipline that studies structure and processes at the molecular scale. In the past, chemists learned to examine and elucidate molecular events by performing collective spectroscopy, that is, measuring average properties from solution or solid-state experiments. Modern techniques, including AFM, allow measurements on a much smaller scale. AFM allows the direct observation and understanding of molecular events occurring in chemical and biological processes, enables the correlation of microscopic structures to macroscopic properties, and permits the design of materials with nanoscopic features. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, including surface and materials science.

Phillips <br/>Palms: A Model System for Evaluating Hydraulic Costs of Plant Size <br/><br/>What are the limits to tree height? This question is both of fundamental interest to biologists, and to those interested in the management of forestry and carbon sequestration. This research will focus on water transport that is one of several key factors that may constrain tree height. The physics and biology underlying hydraulic costs of tree height are complex, and therefore not well understood, because the branching architecture in most tree species ramifies the water stream into innumerable flow paths. In addition, complex branching distributes foliage in multi-faceted layers adding further complexity. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to simplify the problem of assessing hydraulic costs of tree height by using the columnar palm as a simple model of hydraulic tree structure. The research with palms will take place at the Tiputini Research Station in Ecuador. The structural traits of the columnar palms allow analysis of water use in trees without branches. Palm trees consist of a solitary pipeline that supplies water to a distinct and compact crown of leaves. Measurements will characterize water flow through palms that vary in height, up to their maximum. Modeling of integrated impacts of water limitation on growth during the three-year research project will clarify understanding of the relative strengths of six specific mechanisms that incur costs for water transport and potentially limit vertical height growth in trees. Fundamental biophysical processes of the water transport will be examined in this research, resulting in the project improving understanding of water use by most tree species. <br/><br/>The project includes broader impacts that promote international scientific cooperation and exchange between Ecuadorian and U.S. undergraduate students. In addition, the project provides a scientific basis for the economic and social use of the palms throughout Amazonia, which are estimated to be second only to grasses in economic importance. Finally, the project will contribute to continuing NSF support for undergraduate educational activities and research training at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station.

The promise of being able to exchange any amount of information, anytime, anywhere is prompting more and more subscribers to rely solely on their wireless devices for communicating sensitive nformation. As a result, offering a wide range of wireless services to more subscribers while preserving the security of information is becoming essential. Wireless system design efforts so far has aimed solely on providing high capacity. This research nvestigates the fundamental design principles of high capacity ireless systems that ensure secure information delivery.<br/><br/>This research includes the development of a comprehensive framework for the design of the multiuser physical layer that aims at achieving high capacity and secure transmissions for all users. The research addresses the existence of intruders that aim to disrupt communication by creating intentional interference, i.e., jammers; intruders that intercept the communication and attempt to decode the information of the users, i.e., eavesdroppers; and intruders that listen in on the communication and then create intentional interference accordingly, i.e., correlated jammers. Assuming a variety of levels at which the intruders are capable to harm the multiuser system, and using these scenarios as additional design constraints in the physical layer design, this research seeks to establish the performance limits of a variety of multiuser systems in nonfading and fading channels in the presence of security threats; the ways in which the system entities, i.e., transmitters and receivers, can collectively cope with security threats at the physical layer; and the jointly optimum transmit strategies for the users that render the intruders ineffective. The investigators study a variety of multiuser channels including scalar, waveform and vector multiple access and broadcast scenarios, as well as relay and cooperative communication scenarios and identify the fundamental design trade-offs for capacity versus security for a variety of wireless networks.

The Intelligent Mobility Platform with Active Spoke System (IMPASS) utilizes rimless wheels with individually actuated spokes to provide the ability to step over large obstacles like legs, adapt to uneven surfaces like tracks, yet retaining the speed and simplicity of wheels. Since this system lacks the complexity of legs and has a large effective (wheel) diameter, this highly adaptive system can move over extreme terrain with ease while maintaining respectable travel speeds, and thus has great potential for search-and-rescue missions, scientific exploration, and anti-terror response applications. This research project will research, demonstrate and evaluate this novel concept with a focus on studying the issues of mobility, intelligent motion planning, and design. The intellectual merits of the proposed activities lie in the development of an original concept of a new type of high mobility locomotion system and an improved understanding of mobility and intelligent motion planning issues. The broader impacts of this research include the many important application areas of the high mobility system enabled by extending human reach capabilities into unknown and hazardous environments. This effort will integrate research with education and promote teaching and learning by integrating the prototype design into the two-semester undergraduate senior design project. The robot prototypes developed will be demonstrated to the public at the FIRST robotic competitions and at local high schools to promote interest in science and engineering.
0518482	Ubiquitous Prions: Networks of Self-perpetuating Protein Conformations	MCB	Genetic Mechanisms	08/01/2005	06/19/2007	Irina Derkatch	NY	New York University Medical Center	Continuing grant	Susan Porter Ridley	07/31/2008	$480,000.00		irina.derkatch@med.nyu.edu	545 First Avenue	New York	NY	100166481	2122638822	BIO	1112	1116, 9183, BIOT, 1112	$0.00	Some proteins can acquire stable unconventional conformations and pass them on to newly synthesized protein molecules with the same primary sequence. These self-perpetuating protein conformations are called prions. For years, prions were considered to be a rare abnormality. However, recent identification of prions as benign epigenetic modifiers of cellular functions in fungi suggests that prions play a role in normal cellular physiology and evolutionary adaptation. Consequently, there are indications of the existence of molecular mechanisms governing the formation and elimination of self-perpetuating protein conformations. The long-term goal of the PI's research is to understand these mechanisms and the biological role of prions. The major objective of this project is to explore a novel scientific concept of epigenetic control of the appearance of protein-based hereditary traits. Genetic analysis in yeast is the major approach. It is hypothesized that there are two different ways for proteins to attain a prion state. The first mechanism is by direct seeding involving imperfect templating of novel prions by pre-existing ones. Aim 1 will provide material and data for elucidating this mechanism. The second mechanism does not involve a pre-existing template - the prion conformation is a result of spontaneous misfolding. Aim 2 is to determine protein characteristics and cellular factors that facilitate such spontaneous prionization. Because discovery of ubiquitous functional prions is likely to impact many fundamental cellular processes, these studies are expected to impact various fields of modern biology and our understanding of regulation, heredity and evolution. Obtained results may also contribute to agricultural and environmental sciences by explaining yet another mechanism of attaining phenotypic variability. The research will be integrated with education. The lab relies heavily on graduate students - two graduate research assistants are expected to work full time on this project and perform most of experimental work. Also, the S. cerevisiae experimental system provides a unique opportunity to engage undergraduate and even high school students in prion research. Undergraduate students are involved through the NYU Summer Undergraduate Research Program; high school students - through the Intel Science Talent Search project. Results will be presented to diverse audiences.

Under this award, the Principal Investigator (PI) will study the way that local mountain-induced circulations change in response to the daily changes in large-scale weather patterns, and to study the way in which these local circulations feed back on the large-scale flow. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>When an air stream encounters a mountain barrier, mountain waves may be set up above the barrier and lee vortices may form near the surface downstream. Visible manifestations of the flow patterns in these waves may appear in the form of lenticular clouds. When mountain waves break down they form regions of clear air turbulence that are hazardous to aviation, and they also exert a drag on the larger-scale atmospheric flow. The cumulative effect of the drag exerted by flow over mountains throughout the world is too large to be neglected in models of the global weather and climate; but global models lack sufficient detail to correctly calculate the drag from first principles. Out of necessity, this gravity wave drag is parameterized, but the quality and accuracy of these parameterizations are not well established.<br/><br/>Most previous investigations have studied the behavior of mountain waves and lee vortices in situations where the large-scale flow did not vary in time or space, however recently the PI, and others, who will also collaborate in the research, have shown that the mountain waves produced in hypothetical horizontally-uniform steady-state environments may be very different from those that occur in slowly varying environments with temporal fluctuations on a period of two days and spatial variations with a wavelength of 2000 km. Preliminary results also suggest that large-scale variability exerts an even more dramatic effect on the structure of lee vortices. The PI will thoroughly examine the influence of realistic large-scale temporal and spatial variations on the development and subsequent decay of mountain waves and lee vortices. He will also examine the interaction of the mountain waves with the larger-scale weather pattern in order to determine how this interaction should be represented in global weather and climate models. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/> The research and professional development of two graduate students will be supported under this award. Results may have a positive impact on the forecasting of mountain waves, downslope winds and lee vortices in mountainous regions. Lee vortices can have a major impact on air quality in cities downwind of mountain barriers. In addition to modifying the dispersion of everyday pollutants, lee vortices can recirculate chemical or biological agents over a compact region. This research should also improve computer models for the simulation of global weather and climate by helping to improve the representation of gravity wave drag in those models.

The structure and function of molecules that control the processes of life are maintained by weak forces (hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds) and thus are sensitive to small changes in their ionic and osmotic environment. For this reason, organisms invest considerable energy in controlling intracellular and extracellular fluids. In fish, for example, osmoregulation typically consumes 25-50% of total metabolic output. Beyond this, osmotic equilibrium is a fragile balance that is maintained through the continuous interplay of a major portion of the neuroendocrine array. Indeed, a persistently difficult challenge in clinical medicine is the regulation of salt and water balance in seriously ill patients. In view of the cost and importance of osmoregulation, it may seem ironic that the mechanisms that monitor and control salt and water balance in vertebrates are so poorly understood. Closer attention, however, reveals the impediment: the typically complex structure and arrangement of osmoreceptive cells and tissues. In virtually all cases, one cannot simultaneously measure changes in cell size and the osmoregulatory output (hormone release) in a cell that can be distinguished specifically as osmoreceptive cells. In teleost fish, prolactin (PRL) is an essential osmoregulatory hormone that maintains hydromineral balance in fresh water and whose secretion is controlled directly by extracellular osmolality. Consistent with these actions, plasma PRL is elevated in the tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, a euryhaline teleost, in fresh water and PRL release is stimulated when extracellular osmolality declines. Our previous NSF-supported studies demonstrated that a fall in extracellular osmolality leads to the passive influx of water into the PRL cell that increases cell volume within minutes. This initiates an influx of extracellular Ca2+ through stretch-activated channels, producing a rise in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i which stimulates PRL release. This rapid response is extended under sustained stimulation in vitro with increased PRL release being observed for 24 h in hyposmotic medium. On the other hand, PRL release is reduced under hyperosmotic conditions, reflecting its counteraction to salt water osmoregulation. However, signal transduction mechanisms that underlie the osmotic control of sustained PRL release and gene expression are not known. In fact, very little is known about the cellular mechanisms that transduce either acute or chronic osmotic information in any osmoregulatory endocrine system. The present work is aimed at characterizing cellular mechanisms by which extended exposure to physiological changes in ambient osmolality evoke sustained changes in PRL release and gene expression using the tilapia PRL cell model. These studies will provide new insight into the cell-signaling mechanisms that mediate the sustained alteration of the release and production of osmoregulatory hormones that at present cannot be obtained with other model systems. This work will involve students at many levels from high school to graduate students, including several underrepresented minorities, who will be trained in an important area of research, which will have an impact in cell physiology.

Differential equations are commonly used to model physical and biological phenomena in many areas of science and engineering. A differential equation is a rule, a relationship between the solution and its derivatives, that determines how an initial configuration evolves into future configurations. The focus of this project is on the approximation of Lyapunov exponents and related quantities that provide information on stability, the tendency for nearby configurations to evolve nearby, and instability, the tendency for nearby configurations to move apart, and on the analysis and computation of lattice differential equations, i.e., differential equations that are discrete in space and continuous in time. Much of this work emphasizes the blending of rigorous analysis with practical implementation of algorithms. This research has as a central theme: the combination of dynamical systems and numerical analysis ideas together with the modeling and analysis of differential equations. Discrete models play a prominent role in the modeling of physical and biological systems. Of particular interest are traveling wave solutions of lattice differential equations. Sacker-Sell and Lyapunov spectral intervals are natural analogues of the real parts of the eigenvalues that provide stability information for time-varying differential equations. The investigator develops, analyzes, and justifies the use of numerical techniques for the approximation of these spectral intervals. A suite of computational modules for the computation of stability information and for functional traveling waves is being developed. It is backed by analysis of the numerical techniques in a form that should prove useful to working scientists and engineers.

For example, the Wisconsin Land Information System and the new Federal Geospatial One-Stop portals disseminate data and support procedures and simulations in emergency situations. However, geospatial data are complex and highly heterogeneous, having been developed independently by various levels of government and the private sector. This project includes metadata integration methods to enable more precise location of data sources over the web and to provide geospatial portals with query capabilities and semantic resolution for the types of information integration that could help in information discovery, problem-solving, or emergency response.<br/><br/>The research will develop methods and tools to support the integration of information in such a way that end users will have a homogeneous view over heterogeneous data sources. An ontology-based architecture will be developed with which each individual heterogeneous data source can be added to the network of information with relatively little effort. Ontology mappings will establish correspondences between terms in heterogeneous sources and those of standard models and ontologies. The approach also extends ontology mappings to incorporate semantics regarding spatial considerations, such as accuracy, for spatial integration.<br/><br/>Information integration is an area of research that stretches over databases, artificial intelligence, digital libraries, and the semantic web. This project will extend significantly the state of the art of information integration in general and of geospatial information integration in particular, by providing a robust and scalable framework that encompasses techniques and algorithms for integrating heterogeneous data sources using an ontology-based approach.<br/><br/>This project's goal of semantic integration for geospatial data fits into a broad vision for creating a cyberinfrastructure on the Web. In a geospatial cyberinfrastructure, data will be automatically located and semantically matched to other relevant data sources. Manual intervention will not be needed or will be minimal. With such a structure, emergency managers, government officials, and the general public will not be constrained to pre-formulated queries. Instead, ad hoc, exploratory queries and analyses will be possible. From an educational viewpoint, the project will significantly benefit the training of graduate and undergraduate students, in particular of women and minorities, and will include the design of new graduate and undergraduate courses.

There are also well-developed methods for the control and estimation of high or infinite dimensional linear systems. But methods for the control and estimation of high or infinite dimensional nonlinear systems are much less developed. The goal of this research project is to develop model reduction techniques for high or infinite dimensional nonlinear control systems so that low dimensional methodologies and intuition can be utilized. The project will be based on new generalizations to nonlinear systems of balanced realizations and proper orthogonal decompositions.<br/><br/>The world is growing more complex as are the mathematical models that are used to describe, control and measure it. Not only are the sizes of the models growing but also their complex nonlinear behaviors. We need methods to capture their essential behaviors in simpler descriptions. An example is modeling of climate on a regional level. Such phenomena are modeled by nonlinear partial differential equations in time and three space variables. Moreover there are inputs from other climate regions, oceans, etc. Moreover it is only possible to measure the climate at discrete times and locations. Such models are discretized into very high dimensional control systems that strain our current computing capacity and our abilities to interpret the resulting data. What is needed are methods for reducing the complexity of models while maintaining their ability to mirror reality. The goal of this project is to develop such methods.

The instrument will be central to research supported NSF research grants awarded to the six major users, including the Cornell Proteomics Core facility, and multiple minor users. The instrument will complement existing equipment in the proteomics core facility and the Department of Plant Biology, particularly through its application in the analysis of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions and in de-novo sequencing of proteins from organisms whose genomic sequence is unknown. Highly sensitive and accurate tandem mass spectrometers are critical in the identification and characterization of low abundance proteins. In addition, the instrument will be a key tool for comparative quantitative (plant) proteomics studies using stable isotope labeling. The mass spectrometer will accelerate and facilitate a wide range of research projects of Cornell Faculty across different departments. The instrument is also expected to aid in the training of more than 40 undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and will play a role in an NSF-funded outreach program in 'Plant Genomics', a program that attracts high school students and teachers, and impacts undergraduate students from diverse colleges in the region.

The research includes both theory and numerical simulations, which will be compared with observations. The macroscopic study of jet dynamics will address whether and where jets are magnetically or kinetically dominated, which involves estimating the sound, Alfven and flow speeds, heating and cooling rates, and viscosity, for both the jet and the medium. This research will use relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic theory and simulations. The microscopic process study will determine the required properties of shocks in jets, studying particle acceleration, magnetic field generation, and high frequency emission from AGN and GRBs. This research will use a relativistic electromagnetic particle code, enhanced to compute emission from a relativistic shock.<br/><br/>This research will provide a fundamental physical understanding of various microscopic plasma processes, and will develop perturbation theory and numerical simulation methods of broad applicability. The work involves a student and a post-doctoral fellow supported by other funds, and requires significant interaction between university and research facility scientists.

The 2005 conference is the 11th biennial international meeting in a series that focuses on the advances made as the combined power of genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, electrophysiology, imaging and behavioral analysis are brought to bear on fundamental problems in neurobiology. This simple organism can be easily studied and many advances that are made are relevant to the human nervous system. The topics covered will range from molecular biology to complex behavior and include: nerve cell specification, axon guidance and target recognition, synaptic function, neurophysiology, neuronal cell biology and pathology, and complex behavior (for example, circadian rhythms and learning and memory). By vote of the previous participants, the meeting will remain of moderate size (430 participants) to facilitate discussion, exchange of ideas and techniques, and to promote new collaborations in this rapidly evolving field. All applicants will be encouraged to submit an abstract and the majority of participants will either give a talk or present a poster. The speakers will be chosen from the most timely and interesting abstracts submitted a few months in advance of the conference, to ensure that late-breaking science is covered in all of the talks. In the event that the conference is oversubscribed, participants will be chosen to include at least one representative from each participating laboratory. This conference has an established history of highlighting the work of younger investigators and women.

Recent experiments on MgSiO3 perovskite, the dominant phase in Earth's Lower Mantle, indicate the D discontinuity might result from a phase transition from perovskite (pv) to a post-perovskite (ppv) of CaIrO3 structure-type. While this discovery by the mineral physics community has led to rapid application to interpretation of the seismic data, there are several open questions concerning the atomic structure and elastic properties of ppv. The structure and elastic properties are data crucial to the testing of theoretical models and to interpretation of the seismic observations. While studies of silicate ppv structure and elasticity is stymied by the extreme conditions required for synthesis, there are recent theoretical predictions and experimental evidence of pv-ppv phase transitions in NaMgF3 starting at as low as P~18 GPa. NaMgF3 is often used as an analogue for the silicate pv phase. Accurate in situ studies of NaMgF3 and of CaIrO3 at high pressures and temperatures offer a way forward for systematic theoretical/experimental studies of the crystal chemistry and elasticity of the ppv structure at ambient and at high PT conditions. Further, the ppv-NaMgF3 can be recovered to ambient conditions when quenched from above 40 GPa at room temperature, allowing accurate studies of crystallography and elasticity at ambient and high PT to address many of the gaps in our knowledge for this new, and until recently, relatively obscure class of materials. Comparisons of the compression mechanism for the pv form of NaNgF3 through the pv-ppv transition would aid in testing the validity of proposed mechanisms in a system that is tractable both theoretically and experimentally. Although challenging theoretically, CaIrO3 itself needs to be reexamined using modern diffraction techniques, since positions of oxygen were only determined graphically in the mid 60's. Because neutrons are more sensitive to the oxygen in the presence of heavy elements such as iridium than are X-rays, a systematic study of this phase at high PT using neuron scattering is required. These studies will be underpinned by theoretical work being carried out in Minnesota on both NaMgF3 and CaIrO3. The diffraction work will be carried out at neutron and synchrotron X-ray facilities with large volume high-pressure devices, where diffraction and ultrasonic data are collected simultaneously, allowing direct correlation of crystal structure and elasticity as pv-NaMgF3 transforms to ppv-NaMgF3. These results will be applicable to the possible pv-ppv transition at the core mantle-boundary.

Microporous materials (see, for example, http://www.bza.org/zeolites.html) are extremely important industrially, with a global market of several million tons per year. They are used primarily to convert heavy petroleum to fuel, or to soften or purify water. In water softening, for example sodium or potassium inside the pores are exchanged with hard magnesium or calcium. Despite their enormous significance, all such materials known to date are negative in charge and the species in the pores can only be cationic. They would be considerable scientific and industrial interest in obtaining a new class discovery would lead to new applications based on the anions that reside in the pores. For example, anionic pollutants could be trapped by the material, releasing an environmentally benign species in the process. Separations of anionic mixtures, exchange for making new compounds, as well as new catalytic where the size and shape of the template complements that of the material. Preliminary work has been successful in making the switch. Our cationic material can exchange for a variety of other anions in high capacity. It may be possible to recycle these anion-exchangers or absorb priority anionic pollutants, such as arsenates. The research plan is integrated with the educational plan. A series of laboratory experiments and lecture course modules will be developed that study advanced physical techniques for characterizing these materials. The target courses range from freshman to graduate levels. This project is highly interdisciplinary, encompassing chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering, and will give excellent training to graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This CAREER award seeks to develop a new methodology for the synthesis of cationic, inorganic microporous hosts. Layered and microporous metal oxides are a class of materials central to a wide variety of industrial and environmental processes, but currently all hosts are anionic or neutral in charge. This project focuses to create a new class of cationic hosts using anionic structure directing agents (SDAs). The size and shape of the SDA will allow us to tune the channel size and porosity of the cationic host. The potential for scientific and industrial payoff is considerable, opening up a range of possible anion-based applications, including environmental trapping of pollutants, anion-exchange, separation and catalysis. Preliminary work with anionic SDAs has been successful in obtaining our first cationic layered materials, which is highly stable and can exchange for a variety of other anions in high capacity. It may be possible to recycle these anion-exchangers by reversing the intercalation, or absorb other priority anionic pollutants, such as arsenates. Expertise and experience gained in the research plan will be incorporated into the educational plan, building upon the PI's past and present experience in microporous materials. A series of laboratory experiments and lecture course modules, ranging from the freshman to graduate levels, will be developed based on open-frameworks and advanced characterization techniques. This project is highly interdisciplinary, encompassing chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering, and will give excellent training to graduate and undergraduate students. The project will allow the PI to make a significant contribution to materials chemistry, research and education over the course of his career.

Box 92957	Los Angeles	CA	900092957	3103367608	GEO	5750	9196, EGCH	$0.00	This project will construct a comprehensive theoretical model of the Earth's inner radiation belt protons and light ions. The model will be based on an existing simplified proton model. It will describe the inner zone's full spatial dependence, energy dependence, and solar cycle time dependence. Components of the model will include: Monte Carlo simulation of the albedo neutron decay source; injection of solar protons and helium; secondary sources of light ions from nuclear reactions of trapped protons with the neutral atmosphere; energy loss to ionization of the neutral atmosphere, and to free electrons in the ionosphere and plasmasphere, with solar cycle dependence from the historical solar activity record; particle acceleration by adiabatic compression based on multipole geomagnetic field models from the archeomagnetic record and the International Geomagnetic Reference Field; numerical trapped particle trajectory tracing to calculate drift averages of the neutron decay source and the atmospheric densities, and the rigidity trapping limits; nuclear scattering of the trapped particles from the neutral atmosphere, including elastic and inelastic processes; radial diffusion with empirically determined diffusion coefficients; and decay of radioactive trapped secondaries. The resulting model will be compared to existing radiation belt data and empirical models for validation. <br/><br/>The model will provide a framework for understanding the physical processes occurring in the inner zone of the radiation belt. The proposed quantitative study of the relative importance of each model component will lead to a new understanding of the dominant physical mechanisms. In particular, the lifetimes and significant loss mechanisms of the trapped particles will be determined, the relative significance of the external (radial diffusion) and internal (neutron decay and nuclear reaction) sources will be evaluated, and the nuclear reactions that are significant for populating the inner radiation belt will be identified. An accurate model the inner radiation belt will be of practical value for specifying the hazardous radiation environment in low Earth orbit. Current empirical models are used extensively in spacecraft design but are lacking in the detailed energy, spatial, and temporal variations that will be addressed in this work.

The objectives of this research are to explore an innovative approach in developing a nanotechnology-based cooling device being capable of removing high heat flux for cooling the next generation computer chips, and to nurture a new generation of young engineers in nanoscience/engineering. The approaches employed in this project include plasma nanocoating technology to fabricate self-dispersing nanoparticles for stable nanofluids and nanofluids Oscillating Heat Pipes (OHPs). The exploration of plasma nanocoating technology will focus the surface modification of nanoparticles with targeted functions including the effects of plasma chemistry, coating nature and uniformity, and surface functionalities on improving dispersity of nanoparticles and consequently on stability and heat conductivity of nanofluids. The pioneering research of nanofluid OHPs will integrate the ultra-high thermal conductivity of nanofluids, high heat transfer coefficient of thin film evaporation, and heat enhancement of oscillating motion into one nanotechnology-based cooling device for high heat flux removal. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project presents a unique opportunity to explore the frontiers of nanoscience/engineering for intelligent design and development of new-generation heat transfer fluids and cooling devices. Fabrication of the novel nanofluid OHPs will unleash the computing power needed to meet the high demands in scientific computing, image analysis, and remote sensing. Life-science-related research will also benefit from the nanotechnology-based rapid cooling to protect the cells/tissues by eliminating ice formation and solute damage. Cross-trained by experts in a combined setting of academia, national laboratory and industry, the students involved in this project will be tailored to form much broader visions than those for supporting their discipline-specific research alone. Most importantly, the students will be trained to plan for and perform independent research on different sets of constraints and criteria in demonstrating their excellence.

Phelps<br/>Title: Altered nociception and neuronal migration in the dorsal horn of reeler mice <br/>Grant Number: IOB-0518714<br/><br/>The reeler mouse (a mouse whose reeler gene is defective) is characterized by motor coordination defects and tremors that result from errors in cell migration during development of the cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex, both in the brain. Reelin, the protein missing in reeler mice, binds to lipoprotein receptors (VLDL/ApoE2), leading to phosphorylation of the intracellular protein Disabled-1 (Dab1). Mice missing either Dab1 or VLDL/ApoE2 receptors have anatomical and behavioral defects virtually identical to those of reeler mice, as these three molecules function in a common signaling pathway.<br/><br/>Dr. Phelps's lab has provided the first evidence that reeler mutants also have profound sensory defects, including mechanical insensitivity and increased thermal sensitivity. The first aim of this proposal is to determine if mice lacking Dab1 or VLDL/ApoE2 receptor also have defects in pain sensation. The second aim is to study the migratory errors that cause the abnormal sensory processing. Preliminary results suggest that part of the spinal cord (the superficial dorsal horn) in reeler mice contains mispositioned neurons. To prove that these migratory errors are caused by Reelin deficiency, the Reelin signaling pathway will be blocked with the goal of recapitulating the migratory errors in a culture dish. To further link the defects in pain processing with anatomical rearrangements, experiments will be conducted to determine which neurons along the pain processing pathway are responsible for the sensory defects. These studies will focus on the primary sensory neurons that detect pain and their targets in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Finally, the basic migratory patterns that establish dorsal horn lamination will be examined. <br/><br/>This proposal continues activities initially funded by an NSF Early Career Award. Integration of research and teaching activities includes teaching an undergraduate class on the principles of nervous system development and disseminating multimedia material developed for this class in the California Digital Library. Additionally, minority students have and will continue to conduct research in the Phelps' laboratory.

With regard to infinite<br/>dimensional stochastic equations and statistical hydrodynamics,<br/>the investigator focuses on three questions. The first concerns<br/>the structure of typical solutions for nonlinear stochastic<br/>partial differential equations such as the two-dimensional<br/>stochastic Navier-Stokes equations and the stochastic Burgers<br/>equation. The second concerns the uniqueness of steady states for<br/>inviscid randomly forced equations on unbounded domains. The<br/>third concerns the mechanism of energy transfer from high to low<br/>modes in stochastically forced formally conservative systems. For<br/>each of these questions new analytic approaches and new phenomena<br/>have been described. A goal of this work is to more completely<br/>analyze these phenomena. In combinatorics, growth models, and<br/>random matrix theory the investigator studies basic questions of<br/>Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) random matrix theory, focusing<br/>on the connection of symmetrized combinatorial models to limiting<br/>distributions of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. The questions<br/>considered include problems of random tiling that arise in<br/>physics, polynuclear growth models that arise in the study of<br/>random interfaces, and percolation models that arise in condensed<br/>matter physics and electrical engineering. A goal of the work is<br/>to prove new central limit theorems in the context of GOE random<br/>matrix theory. <br/><br/> Understanding the small-scale structure of stochastically<br/>forced hydrodynamic equations is related to turbulence theory and<br/>statistical mechanics. The small-scale structure of solutions is<br/>of both theoretical and experimental importance. It is this<br/>structure that matters in turbulent flows arising in many concrete<br/>problems of aerodynamics and fluid mechanics. The particular<br/>questiuons studied here contribute to the current understanding of<br/>this small-scale structure. It has recently become clear that<br/>random matrix theory techniques answer a wide range of questions<br/>in a variety of seemingly unrelated fields. Essentially, random<br/>matrix theory affords a model that captures the fluctuations of<br/>many distinct processes. The questions studied in this project<br/>widen this class of problems and processes and improve the current<br/>understanding of the various phenomena that lead to random matrix<br/>statistics.

Code is being developed to explicitly integrate the time-dependent Hartree-Fock and density functional equations, and to carry out Ehrenfest dynamics. This is being used to study the electronic and molecular dynamics ofmolecules in intense laser fields prior to ionization. Ab initio molecular dynamics will be applied to benzene dication fragmentation and to study reaction branching ratios. The mechanism of OXA-10 beta-lactamase and carbonic anhydrase, and inhibition of matrix metalloproteases are being investigated by QM/MM methods. Studies in materials, inorganic and organometallic chemistry include zinc oxide chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition, excited states and non-linear optical properties of donor-acceptor conjugated macrocycles and bonding in main group metal - transition metal complexes. To support these studies, new computational methods are being developed in areas such as reaction path optimization, automated potential energy surface searching and ab initio molecular dynamics.. The work is having a broad impact on a wide variety of topics in chemistry.
0522263	Everyday Morality in American Mental Health Care: A Comparative Ethnography	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY	07/01/2005	07/13/2005	Paul Brodwin	WI	University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee	Standard Grant	Deborah Winslow	06/30/2007	$55,972.00		brodwin@uwm.edu	P O BOX 340	Milwaukee	WI	532010340	4142294853	SBE	1390	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Many professions in modern society have formal codes of ethics. But we know little about how professionals actually resolve ethical dilemmas in the midst of everyday work. Do abstract ethics codes significantly influence the ways professionals understand and act on their ethical obligations? Or are practical, local workplace conditions more important determinants? This two-year project develops new empirical methods for the study of everyday ethics in modern professional life, focusing on the case of American community psychiatry. Ever since deinstitutionalization in the 1960s, most severely mentally ill Americans receive treatment in community settings. Front-line clinicians in community psychiatry face difficult moral dilemmas: caring for patients who mistrust the mental health system, persuading or coercing patients to accept treatment, and acting as gatekeepers to scarce medical and financial resources. This project features in-depth ethnography and interviews with mental health clinicians in two contrasting settings in Milwaukee, WI: an outpatient clinic (resembling standard office practice) and an innovative program in Assertive Community Treatment (where treatment is delivered in patients' homes and mental health workers are involved in all aspects of patients' lives). The conditions of work differ dramatically across these settings, in terms of the professional/patient relations, everyday work activities, and the workplace mission. The project compares how clinicians in each setting talk about moral concerns, negotiate conflicts with patients, and adapt formal ethics codes to shifting everyday realities. It will thus determine how workplace conditions affect clinicians ' moral judgments and their face-to-face interactions with patients.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this knowledge is to show which aspects of the workplace push professionals to abandon abstract ideals and devise new, or more intuitive, moral explanations. Results will be widely presented to educators in community mental health fields (social work, nursing and psychiatry) to help them recognize when and why ethics codes become useful or irrelevant. This research will also advance bioethics - a field dominated by theology and law - by demonstrating the value of empirical, ethnographic research into moral decision-making and its social context.

Traditionally, biologists have constructed models to capture this complexity and verify their intuitions as well as communicate how a particular biological system or subsystem actually works. To build these models, biologists rely on a very general and broad array of knowledge, and also augment it with depth and expertise obtained from small number of exemplar systems. With availability of large amount of high-throughput experimental data, biologists are also faced with the task of reconstructing models from data where relevant information may be deeply buried in layers of numerical information.<br/>Biological models are often presented pictorially as graphs and flow charts with many components, each corresponding to a certain biochemical reaction. Such diagrams have also, but not always, been associated with mathematical models, mostly in the form of differential equations. The equations are used to perform simulations of the system, when they have a well-defined set of kinetic parameters. The model is refuted or validated depending on whether the simulated traces agree with biological data.<br/><br/>Often one is faced with situations, where there is no mathematical model, or the model is incomplete and they lack a complete set of parameters, and yet biologists do have detailed descriptive understanding of many of the components and their interactions. For instance, current microarray data analysis techniques draw the biologist's attention to targeted sets of genes but do not otherwise present global and dynamic perspectives (e.g., invariants) inferred collectively over a dataset. When ontologically invariants are inferred from experiments (using GOALIE redescription tool), such invariants can be compared with the known descriptive information to determine if we have complete and consistent theories about certain biological processes.<br/>This project addresses these two scenarios by providing automated reasoning tools that bridge both computational and descriptive models in biology. The results from these tools and experimental analyses hint at the construction of efficiently testable predictions. The results of wet-lab experiments are then used to refine and amend the formal model. This feedback cycle between modeling and experimentation has proven important in obtaining a process-level understanding of the underlying cellular machinery.<br/><br/>The further characterization of specific parts of the mammalian cell cycle behavior (e.g. how a possibly unknown factor may allow the phosphorlyzation Cdk inhibitor p27 by Cdk2 at G1/S.)<br/>In the longer run, understanding the wider implications of the complex regulatory and metabolic architecture of the cell cycle will provide significant insights into new applications of biology and advanced computing. In addition, they will provide new perspectives on computing by exploiting biologically driven metaphors. More importantly, the approaches developed in the context of hybrid-system (HS) models and bio-ontology will find applications to swarm robotics, social-software, e-commerce, complex interactive engineered systems, computer-security, adaptive software, etc., although from our own historical perspective, we will remain engaged in proving the first successes of this approach in biomedical applications.

The partnership takes a three-step approach to this problem. (1) In the first step the project engages whole groups of ethnically diverse upper elementary school students in science research partnerships offered as afterschool programming; research partnerships help make the scientific process seem accessible and engaging, so that participants consider themselves able to do science. (2) In the second step PRI scientist educators engage a subset of those students who are especially interested in further opportunities for research and associated Museum education, and during the process help students consider if a career in the geosciences might be appropriate for them. (3) In the third step students are involved as mentors in research partnership outreach for the next cohort of students and as interpreters for peers in their school classes and afterschool activities. <br/>The project involves ethnically diverse upper elementary school students from a part of Ithaca, NY that has a high proportion of minority students. Students participate at PRI's new education and exhibits facility, the Museum of the Earth. The project uses several of PRI's existing initiatives for involving students in science, including the Devonian Seas Project, the Mastodon Matrix Project, and Collections Connections. K-5 students from GIAC visit the Museum exhibits and participate in research partnership activities according to their age level; twelve 4th and 5th graders become Junior Geoscientists and visit the Museum twice a week for the academic year, participating in geoscience activities, helping to create an exhibit, and learning to be docents. Later the students interact with their peers at school and GIAC, and help train the next cohort of Junior Geoscientists. The project runs for two years, in order to test the effectiveness of having students from the first year teach students from the second. The project is being tested in Ithaca's urban microcosm, after which PRI will implement the project in nearby Syracuse and Utica, looking toward application of the model to enhancing diversity in the geosciences nationally.

Some theorize that ritual promotes sociality by requiring costly investments of time, effort or resources as reliable signals of commitment to the group. Public displays of devotion allow individuals to monitor each other's behavior and thus serve to prevent cheating and encourage cooperation. These issues will be studied by a dissertation project in cultural anthropology focusing on the Afro-Brazilian religion of Candomble. The ceremonies and feasts of the religion can be particularly extravagant and expensive for followers, yet it is a growing spiritual option for many poor and low middle-class Brazilians. This research will investigate the relationship between religious commitment and solidarity in Candomble congregations in the city of Salvador da Bahia. It will test the hypothesis that members of these religious communities who display higher commitment levels to the religion will also be more cooperative and cohesive. Commitment will be assessed through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods including participant observation, semi-structured interviews and a commitment scale. Cooperation will be measured through the use of an experimental economic game. Social network analysis will reveal levels of cohesion and solidarity within each community. <br/>The broader impact of this project is gaining an understanding of the elements which characterize a successful religious group, which is increasingly important given the current resurgence of religion as a political and social motivation. Parallel processes may also operate in other social institutions that restrict membership. Additionally, this research project will advance the training of a doctoral student and provide training opportunities for two undergraduate assistants from Brazilian universities.

Energy management therefore plays a paramount role in not only hardware design but also in user-application, middleware and operating system design. This project focuses on techniques, algorithms and OS support to scale down energy needs whenever the system performance can be relaxed. Specifically, the project will study energy-aware resource reservations and slack-stealing algorithms to satisfy both performance needs and energy constraints.<br/><br/>Many energy management schemes also focus on a single resource that is dedicated to real-time or non-real-time processing. Unfortunately, in many practical systems such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), cellular phones, robots and personal computers, the combination of hard and soft real-time periodic tasks, aperiodic real-time tasks, interactive tasks and batch tasks must be supported. Each task may also require access to multiple resources. Therefore, this project will tackle the NP-hard problem of providing timely and simultaneous access to multiple resources by the use of practical abstractions and near-optimal heuristics aided by cooperative scheduling. Approaches where power management is carried out in different islands separately will also be compared against non-partitioning approaches. Finally, the project will address the need for explicit power management in system software for sensor networks.

Students are conducting long-term investigations and monitoring of the Earth system in and around the Jemez Pueblo and the neighboring Valles Caldera to understand: variations in weather and micro-climate; evolutionary trends in vegetation, soil conditions and the distribution of fauna and flora due to natural and human influences; the complexity of the hydrologic system; and the dynamics of the still active volcanic and seismic systems in the region. These investigations are closely tied to the cultural and historical traditions of the Jemez people. In partnership with scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and community leaders from the Jemez Pueblo, students and teachers are learning about Earth processes through experimentation in the classroom and a weeklong summer science camp in the Valles Caldera area. By institutionalizing effective teaching practices in the Jemez middle schools, the project invigorates students' interest in scientific exploration. This project offers the Jemez Pueblo community an opportunity to start a new tradition, one that is consistent with their traditional culture, but also includes new ways to address problems facing their society and the world. The long-term vision of this program is to extend participation to all of New Mexico's Native American people and become a model implemented by school districts across the U.S.
0510825	Cyclic Processes Within Surface-exposed Fractures Affecting Evaporation and Salinization Mechanisms	EAR	HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES	08/01/2005	07/21/2008	Maria Dragila	OR	Oregon State University	Continuing grant	Thomas Torgersen	07/31/2010	$349,740.00	Noam Weisbrod, Abraham Grader	maria.dragila@peak.org	OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY	Corvallis	OR	973318507	5417374933	GEO	1579	9189, EGCH	$0.00	0510825<br/>Dragila<br/>This project will investigate chemico-physical processes in near-surface fractures that may be responsible for enhanced basin-scale evaporation and accelerated transport of solutes (salinity) to groundwater. In arid and semiarid regions where groundwater is a scarce commodity, groundwater salinization has become an ever-increasing concern. This same mechanism is also of interest because of the waste facilities typically located in these type environments. Salt crust formation is the result of a complex process caused by the interaction of various important mechanisms, such as gradients in permeability, osmotic potential and thermal energy. These processes can act in concert to either reduce or enhance salt crust formation, including: (1) accelerated evaporation during nighttime venting; (2) osmotic gradients that result in vapor pumping and saline back-diffusion; (3) salt precipitation that can clog internal pores and/or cause surface sealing of the rock; (4) salt crust morphology that can impact fracture aperture; and (5) haloclasic erosion that can change the surface texture and evaporation rate. Even though these mechanisms have<br/>been observed either in the field or during preliminary work, the long-term effect has not been evaluated.<br/>The working model consists of a vadose zone with exposed surface fractures. When these fractures are air filled, evaporation from the fracture walls triggers capillary forces that draw pore-water and solutes from the matrix where further evaporation occurs, thus resulting in enhanced salt accumulation on the fracture walls. Daytime vapor pressure gradients drive a relatively slow diffusional process that vents moist fracture air. During nighttime, however, unstable air-density gradients permit denser surface air to enter the fracture resulting in mass convection and venting of moist fracture air, thus enhancing evaporation of the fracture surface and enhancing concomitant salt crust formation. Theoretical analysis indicates that nighttime convective venting may increase evaporative potential by a factor of 80. The concept of a near-surface fracture serving as a reactive convection cell and the concept of nighttime convection has only recently been investigated. This project will focus on the impact that this convective venting has on salt crust formation under various natural conditions. The proposed research will use a Climate Control Chamber (OSU) and x-ray CT-scanning (PSU) to investigate pore-scale processes of evaporation and salt deposition within rock cores for a range of permeabilities. Intermediatescale experiments will be conducted in a large Climate Controlled Room (BGU) to explore the aforementioned mechanisms under controlled conditions for a natural fractured rock. Field-scale venting and evaporation dynamic will be investigated in a real fracture (instrumented to a depth of ~1.4 m.) located at a well-characterized fracturedchalk<br/>site. Numerical models will be used to quantify basin scale impact of this process on contaminant bypassing, solute loading to aquifer and basin scale evaporation. Most importantly the project will determine the limiting parameters for this process, i.e., under which geologic and climatic conditions will this process be most important.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The role of open (air-filled) cavities in vadose zone hydrodynamics has been largely ignored, except as rapid conduits of fluids. There is substantial field evidence that salty crust is indeed precipitated on the surfaces of fractures that cross the upper vadose zone during the long dry season emphasizing the need to investigate this process. We are not aware of any treatments of this topic outside of those recently submitted for publication by the<br/>PI's. The project design is such that it will not only develop fundamental understanding of the salt crusting process, but also establish the parameters important for basin scale hydrology. Applicability within arid land hydrology understanding the potential for diverted contamination seepage from waste facilities.<br/><br/>Broader impacts:<br/>This project is the result of international collaboration between Oregon State University, Pennsylvania State University and Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel. Two students involved in the project will work in an international interdisciplinary setting developing collaborative skills essential for their success as future scientists. Because science education is a national priority, the project will also participate in the NSF G-K12 Program with the dual goal of disseminating research results to educators and providing pedagogical training to graduate students readily<br/>tangible and inspiring toward the pursuit of further research. The project will develop a workshop unit for in-service K-12 teachers, pilot a thematic unit at a participating primary school, develop a teaching kit that can be on loan to interested educators, and a web site for those who wish to replicate the teaching kit and unit.

In light of the fast growing data deluge in science, engineering, industry and society, recognition systems must be able to operate without human supervision. This poses new challenges: How can one learn automatically models of a large number of object classes from unlabelled images? How can one represent these object classes such that they can be searched efficiently? How can one leverage the learnt models to learn new object classes from very few examples?<br/><br/>It is proposed that these challenges may be met by inferring hierarchical representations of object classes from unlabelled image data. Object classes are represented as constellations of parts, where each part extracts shape and appearance information.<br/>Non-parametric Bayesian techniques may be employed to organize these object classes into tree-structured representations. The richness of this representation grows incrementally as more data is presented to the system. New similarity measures between object classes naturally derive from this representation facilitating recognition.<br/><br/>Outreach to the local community is established through a collaboration with the California State University Northridge where students, often minorities who are the first in the family to obtain a university degree, will have the opportunity to engage in visual recognition problems proposed by and relevant to local companies.

A<br/>patterned polymer brush in comparison is one that is attached to a surface in a spatially<br/>defined micron or nanometer-sized region. A focus of the proposed research will be to<br/>examine the synthesis of di- and triblock copolymer brushes and to evaluate in detail<br/>their polymerization and microstructure. A second focus of this proposal will be to<br/>pattern polymer brushes at length scales comparable to brush length and to investigate<br/>their behavior and microstructure in these confined regions. Patterning methods will<br/>include e-beam and EUV lithography as well as near-field scanning optical methods. If<br/>successful, this study will provide an exciting opportunity to overcome many of the<br/>barriers currently encountered in small scale (~10 nm) structure formation and at the same<br/>time provide an excellent model system for exploring the converging length scales in<br/>top-down (lithography) and bottom-up (self-assembly) processing. We expect that this<br/>convergence will lead to interesting synergies and may enable directed assembly of the<br/>block copolymer brushes. Such an approach could bridge the gap between the limits of<br/>current lithographic methods (>50 nm) and the need to achieve nanostructures as small as<br/>10 nm. The proposed research will require expertise in polymer synthesis, lithographic<br/>patterning and analytical methods capable of characterizing the small-scale structures we<br/>plan to produce. To aid us in the characterization of these new materials, we will make<br/>use of our collaborations to investigate the patterned block copolymer brushes using a<br/>range of synchrotron based analytical methods including X-ray reflectometry, grazing<br/>incidence (GI) SAXS and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) studies.                          <br/>Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity: This program will engage motivated<br/>undergraduate researchers throughout the course of the proposed research program.<br/>Students will be connected with graduate student mentors and will participate in all<br/>aspects of the research program. REU students from programs at Cornell will take part<br/>during the summer. Participants in this program will take part in outreach activities<br/>aimed at communicating the use of patterned polymer brushes. We will also provide<br/>educational samples of patterned brushes to interested teachers during participation in<br/>Cornell high school teacher outreach activities. A number of companies will collaborate<br/>with us on our research activities helping to carry out patterning studies.

Nelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Hrvoje Petek of the University of Pittsburgh in a research effort as a Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT). Their work will focus on developing devices and methods enabling the manipulation of electromagnetic fields at the nanometer scale. Specifically, the group will work on developing a structural element (a portal) that will enable a shaped, femtosecond laser pulse to individually address single quantum dots in proximity to the portal. The NIRT brings together a multidisciplinary team that can address all aspects of the project from quantum dot synthesis to femtosecond coherent control and time-resolved plasmonic imaging to theoretical modeling and design. The results of this research should contribute broadly to nanotechnology and nanoscience by enabling direct access to the nanoscale with optical methods that have long been restricted to micron length scales. This work will provide the participating graduate and postdoctoral researchers with opportunities to develop expertise in a unique combination of methods in modern optics and advanced materials research: ultrafast optics, coherent control, plasmonics, nanomaterials fabrication and design, and sophisticated modeling. Moreover, high school and undergraduate research students will be introduced to the work of this NIRT project through expansion of existing efforts at MIT and the REU program at University of Pittsburgh.

Lack of an adequate treatment of GSW and other important physical processes in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations hampers a full understanding of the evolution of the IGM. This research will carry out adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulations with all likely relevant physical processes carefully treated, to compute more precisely the evolution of the IGM, and specifically, the warm-hot IGM (WHIM) at low redshift and the Lyman alpha forest at moderate redshift. This will produce a detailed characterization of the distribution of the WHIM, allowing future observational determination of the fraction of the cosmic baryons in this state. It will also help to quantify systematic errors, again allowing future observational constraints on the matter power spectrum to be accurate enough to shed useful light on inflationary theories. This research will set up an adequate framework to interpret the vast observational database on evolution of the IGM, in a physically self-consistent fashion.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work include continuing an effective outreach program to the general public, using visualizations presented through effective channels, such as at the Rose-Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum of Natural History, and public television programs such as Nova.
0515263	Triggered Strategies in Wireless Networks with Multiple Calls, Multiple Channel Services and Multiple-Level QoS Degradations	CCF	THEORY OF COMPUTING	07/15/2005	07/07/2005	Wei Li	OH	University of Toledo	Standard Grant	Richard Beigel	05/31/2008	$150,000.00		Liw@tsu.edu	2801 W Bancroft St., MS 944	TOLEDO	OH	436063390	4195302844	CSE	2860	9218, HPCC	$0.00	In this proposal, the PI will develop novel efficient and effective network adaptive and dynamic bandwidth allocation strategies, named as triggered strategies, for the advanced wireless networks with multiple-class calls, multiple-channel services and multiple-level quality of service (QoS) degradations. Different calls may have the different priorities for the upgrade and/or the degradation. The key idea of the proposed strategies is to give some reasonable more chances for the blocked calls in the common sense in order to get at least the minimal bandwidth requirement from one of the neighbor cells. The core theoretic concept here is developing the quasi-reversibility concept of stochastic processes with especially consideration of the wireless and mobility features of the networks. The significant result of the triggered strategies is that the equilibrium distribution of a wireless multimedia network in general can be verified to be a product form of individual cell's equilibrium distribution. The PI also plans to provide a complete theoretical analysis of the complexity for the proposed strategies and to test the actual performance of practical interest for general wireless multimedia networks with and without using of triggered strategies. The PI will compare the results under the triggered adaptive schemes with those possible results without using of the triggered strategies and will make a software package for the triggered strategies. Another idea of this proposal is to find the optimal triggered strategy in terms of the Markov Decision Process.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The proposed triggered strategies significantly improve almost all current existing bandwidth allocation strategies and importantly produce ways of finding extremely important network's performance measures, which could not be obtained in terms of the current methods in the literature. These measures, for example, may include the proportion of a class u call at cell j can only receive a level v QoS when it comes, the probability that a class u call will gain higher QoS than class v calls, degradation period ratio, degradation ratio, upgrade/degrade frequency, system degradation probability, call degradation probability and other network important measures. The proposed theoretic results will provide rigorously novel approaches for the analysis of adaptive resource allocation strategies for wireless multimedia networks which are in great demand.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: Our research results will be disseminated in leading journals and conferences, and will be incorporated into courses and seminars. Via the training of students, and via collaborations and technical interactions with colleagues, both in the US and abroad, the work will lead to yet further technical progress. There are ongoing collaborations with colleagues in Canada, Japan, and China. This project will lead to the incorporation of various novel technical tools into independent studies, courses, and research seminars, which will be part of the training of many students in the department of electrical engineering and computer science. For example, this project will directly impact the capabilities, interests, and careers of the graduate students who participate in the project. At the University of Toledo, a new Ph.D. program in Computer Science and Engineering is in the final stages of approval and implementation. The success of this project would give the program a very strong boost.
0514509	Endocrine Activity and the Ontogeny of Social Interactions and Bonding	IOS	BEHAVIORAL SYSTEMS CLUSTER	09/01/2005	07/18/2005	Michael Hennessy	OH	Wright State University	Standard Grant	Diane M. Witt	08/31/2009	$300,986.00		michael.hennessy@wright.edu	3640 Colonel Glenn Highway	Dayton	OH	454350001	9377752425	BIO	7472	1096, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	In both our own and other species, important, but still poorly understood, relations exist between the body's physiological reaction to stress and the presence of significant social partners.  On the one hand, the presence of social partners with which a strong bond has been formed can often reduce the physiological stress response, while on the other, reductions in stress-related hormone levels seem to promote the formation of social bonds.  The current project will examine these effects and how they change over the life span as individuals form differing age-specific social relations and undergo normal developmental changes in neuroendocrine activity.  These questions will be studied in guinea pigs because of their similarity to primates in the ways that social behavior affects stress hormone levels, and because these questions can be studied with greater experimental control, more economically, and in a reasonable period of time in this rodent species.  This project will assess the impact of various social partners throughout the life span on stress hormone levels; examine how this impact varies with normal age-specific changes in social interactions and stress hormone responsiveness; and assess how altering hormone responsiveness affects the formation of adult social bonds.  These studies will provide new information on the development of basic biobehavioral processes related to stress and social interactions, and they will provide a unique contribution in their longitudinal approach.  The work will also integrate research and undergraduate education by involving promising undergraduates interested in careers in the life sciences in every aspect of the studies.

The framework<br/>consists of a suite of security mechanisms spanning three phases:<br/>prevention, detection, and reaction. This research seeks to provide fundamental<br/>security services covering key management, authentication, compromise<br/>detection, and revocation. These services are essential for the successful<br/>deployment of sensor networks. In addition, the research seeks solutions that<br/>are designed and implemented in a distributed manner, where no central<br/>authority is involved. This distributed property is critical for unattended<br/>sensor networks deployed in adversarial environments, because a central<br/>authority is a single point of failure from both security and performance<br/>perspectives. The success of this project will have broad impact, making sensor networks more trustworthy and amenable to commercial, civilian, and military applications. The results of the project are disseminated through publications and talks, and the research is integrated into the computer science and engineering curriculum at Penn State.
0516587	Role of Brain Circuits in Legged Locomotion in Insects	IOS	SENSORY SYSTEMS, ENVIRON & STRUCTURAL SYS CL	09/01/2005	06/20/2007	Roy Ritzmann	OH	Case Western Reserve University	Continuing grant	Mark Kirk	08/31/2009	$545,000.00		roy.ritzmann@case.edu	Nord Hall, Suite 615	CLEVELAND	OH	441064901	2163684510	BIO	1185, 7474	9183, BIOT	$0.00	Legged locomotion evolved as the most effective form of movement through difficult environments. Although much research has focused upon control of basic leg movements, it is an animal's capacity to re-direct these movements around unpredicted barriers that makes legged locomotion particularly successful. Upon encountering an obstacle, an animal must evaluate the object with its sensors, then use that information to effectively turn or climb over the barrier. In this project Dr. Ritzmann will examine how insect nervous systems control these movements. He will target specific brain regions with a range of techniques with increasing precision. These techniques include various recording and stimulation procedures combined with high-speed video analysis of behavior. They will allow Dr. Ritzmann to examine just how sensory information is used to generate descending commands that ultimately alter leg movements and, thereby, allow the animal to deal with barriers.<br/>Dr. Ritzmann's project will have wide ranging impacts. The issues of movement through complex terrain confront virtually all legged animals, and similar control systems must be present. In vertebrates, control occurs through interactions between motor regions of the brain, such as the cerebellum, and local circuits in the spinal cord. Nevertheless, the basic control problem is the same as that found in insects, yet insects provide significant technical advantages for the experiments that he will pursue. The control issues must also be solved by robots as they traverse complex and unpredictable terrain. Indeed, failure to deal with such problems limited success of search vehicles in the World Trade Center tragedy. In other projects, Dr. Ritzmann collaborates with engineers in Dr. Roger Quinn's Biorobotics laboratory to develop advanced robotic vehicles based upon biological control that can perform dangerous missions with little supervision. Results from Dr. Ritzmann's project have tremendous potential for improving the designs of these vehicles.

The recent results in human visual perception strongly suggest that contour extraction is a key step to object recognition. A development of a contour-based system for object recognition is proposed. The first step of the new approach concentrates on extraction of object contours from edge images that correspond to contours as perceived by humans. Since the extraction of complete contours may not be possible (e.g., due to occlusion), extraction is focused on meaningful parts of contours. The proposed approach uses a mixture of bottom up and top down processing for edge grouping. After each step of bottom-up processing in a pyramid architecture, top-down evaluation is applied to select the most promising grouping constellations. A promising grouping constellation is defined using cognitively motivated constraints. In accord with the cognitive simplicity principle known from Gestalt psychology, partial shape similarity will be used as a primary building block of such constraints. In accord with the newest results in human perception, grouping of edges to parts of object contours and recognition of the parts using shape similarity play a key role in object recognition. This means that object recognition is possible if only part of a contour is constructed, and the construction of the whole contour is not necessary for recognition. In particular, object recognition works in the presence of occlusion and segmentation errors. <br/><br/> The proposed solution to the object recognition problem can make a significant step to improve the application scope of vision systems. The results of this work will be applicable to vision systems, large image databases, and video analysis systems. The proposed research to find interdependence and structural information among visual parts may lead to further understanding of human visual perception and cognition. The proposed research will provide an excellent resource for interdisciplinary work for graduate and undergraduate students in computer science and psychology. The PIs will offer courses and seminars on proposed research topics that will bring the state-of-the-art knowledge and technology to the classrooms.

In light of the fast growing data deluge in science, engineering, industry and society, recognition systems must be able to operate without human supervision. This poses new challenges: How can one learn automatically models of a large number of object classes from unlabelled images? How can one represent these object classes such that they can be searched efficiently? How can one leverage the learnt models to learn new object classes from very few examples?<br/><br/>It is proposed that these challenges may be met by inferring hierarchical representations of object classes from unlabelled image data. Object classes are represented as constellations of parts, where each part extracts shape and appearance information.<br/>Non-parametric Bayesian techniques may be employed to organize these object classes into tree-structured representations. The richness of this representation grows incrementally as more data is presented to the system. New similarity measures between object classes naturally derive from this representation facilitating recognition.<br/><br/>Outreach to the local community is established through a collaboration with the California State University Northridge where students, often minorities who are the first in the family to obtain a university degree, will have the opportunity to engage in visual recognition problems proposed by and relevant to local companies.

The geological conditions that led to the formation of this and other related deposits are poorly understood; this project will characterize the lateral and vertical zonation of minerals within the Navachab hydrothermal system and determine how those distributions can be recognized spectrally. The geological characteristics to be documented at this site will contribute to a better understanding of element redistribution in the Earth's crust and provide improved criteria for exploration using field-based and remote-sensing methods in many regions of the world. Because the Navachab Mine is Namibia's only active gold mine and a major stimulus for economic development in the country, an improved understanding of this formation will enhance efforts to locate and develop such resources in Namibia. <br/><br/>The project builds on a successful international collaboration among the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, the Geological Survey of Namibia, AngloGold Ashanti (owners of the Navachab Mine), and the U.S. Geological Survey's National Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science. These partners are committed to using new remote-sensing technology to advance understanding of fundamental geological processes as well as to assist Namibia both in sustainable development of its natural resources and in training a technologically-advanced domestic workforce. For the U.S. doctoral student, the project will provide first-hand experience in the increasingly global practices of scientific research and mineral exploration and production.

Box 1185	Arcata	CA	955181185	7078264189	GEO	1573	0000, 9229, OTHR	$0.00	The formation of basalt by partial melting of the Earth's mantle is one of the most significant geodynamic processes on the planet. Despite decades of high-pressure experiments, few peridotite partial melting data in the 2.0-3.0 GPa pressure range exist. In order to enhance our knowledge of near-solidus mantle melting, a three-year study investigating the 2.0-3.0 GPa partial melting systematics of multiple peridotite compositions will be completed. Handpicked olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and spinel grains from two mantle xenoliths, of differing compositional fertility, will be mixed in varying proportions to create starting materials of varying bulk composition. These same starting materials were studied previously at 1.0 GPa. Experiments will be performed using the piston-cylinder apparatus utilizing a combination of the diamond aggregate and micro-sandwich techniques to eliminate the problem of quench modification of the glass. This will enable determination of low melt fraction glass and residual crystalline phase compositions, estimation of solidus temperatures over a range of pressures, and quantification of melt productivity and the stoichiometry of mantle melting reactions. <br/><br/>The resulting polybaric dataset will provide constraints on the processes resulting in the formation of basalts in the mid-ocean ridge environment, as well as other tectonic regimes where polybaric melting and peridotite-melt interaction occur. An integral component and broader impact of the project includes the direct involvement of undergraduate research students and completion of an experimental petrology laboratory at a primarily undergraduate institution. Teaching activities using the laboratory and project data will be developed and incorporated into the geology curriculum, thus benefiting a larger population of students long into the future.

The participants will explore the proposed and potential value of NSF nascent and current observing systems to address these challenges. Of critical importance will be the identification of gaps in knowledge that will remain or become more critical as observing systems are deployed, and how this may affect the role of non-observing system science. Of particular importance will be the identification of synergies among and within<br/>observing systems and system requirements for inter-operability. The anticipated intellectual impact will be the identification of emergent frontiers, unrealized research opportunities, and unique infrastructure capacity that arise from the combined environmental research observing systems and networks. The workshop will have broad impacts by defining the potential of observing systems to generate solutions to environmental problems relevant to society. In addition, the resulting reports will contribute to the planning, funding, implementation, coordination, and use of the observing systems through formulating a set of recommendations for the AC-ERE, NSF, and the wider community.

It will include a power system and heated space sufficient for the experiments, as well as the capability for data acquisition, data storage, and real time data transmission via satellite. As part of the proposed work, two prototypes of this observatory will be built and tested for extended periods of time in cold chambers, on Mt. Washington, and at the South Pole.<br/> Significant outstanding science issues in several diverse fields drive the need for a network of reliable autonomous observatories capable of operation in polar regions. In solar-terrestrial physics, the geomagnetic polar cap forms a key window on the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere. In the field of atmospheric science one vital object of study for this new technology is the Type 1a (nitric acid trihydrate) polar stratospheric cloud, implicated in the annual austral springtime destruction of stratospheric ozone over Antarctica. For terrestrial seismic studies, a central goal is determining the crustal and mantle structure from analysis of seismic signals received following earthquakes, a methodology which requires a network of receiving stations over the area of study. The seismic character of Antarctica is not well-known, and furthermore, the lack of seismic stations at very high latitudes translates into ignorance of the polar regions of the Earth's core, since acoustic ray paths penetrating this region can only be received at extremely high latitudes.<br/> While one of the immediate applications of the proposed ARRO development is to replace the current generation of Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO's) in the Antarctic interior, the ARRO design is sufficiently agile to incorporate additional instrumentation and enable pursuit of a broad science agenda by a large and growing group of institutions and individual investigators.<br/> Finally, ARRO development includes several different layers of research and research training. Students will be directly involved in the development, from the initial design stages to deployment of the units to Mt. Washington and the South Pole. The eventual establishment of a network of observatories over the polar cap will involve a much larger number of students in a broad scientific agenda. ARRO also includes significant connections to industry and government units outside of the academic science community, and their participation will sharpen the capabilities of these companies to serve the nation in applications of technology to challenging environments of cold weather and high altitudes.

By exploring both family-level and individual-level measures of well-being, this dissertation research will shed light on the family and work tradeoffs that men and women make across the course of their lives and how these tradeoffs produce inequities in economic and health well-being. This research will also explore period effects and changes in the consequences of parenthood to women's and men's well-being over time. Finally, this research will explore variation in the consequences of parenthood to women's and men's well-being across sub-national political and economic contexts. In addition to gender differences, attention will be paid throughout to consequences of parenthood as they vary by other ascribed and achieved statuses including marital and divorce statuses, race, and social class. Research findings will be based on descriptive longitudinal analyses, fixed effects regression models, and cross-sectional instrumental variable models. Data comes from the five percent Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79), and the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women (NLSY Mature Women). This research will advance methodological and theoretical debates between sociologists, economists, and demographers, including but not limited to, post-industrial family and employment trends, how to quantify causal relationships, and the permanency of household-level versus individual-level economic well-being. Findings will also inform a number of family policy debates surrounding the tradeoffs between women and children's economic well-being.

The C. elegans equivalent of a female is a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite that can also mate with a male. Male-attraction and hermaphrodite-avoidance are elicited by factors released into the environment by hermaphrodites. Both sexes are exposed to the same social signals, and the nervous systems of males and hermaphrodites are highly similar, yet their responses are diametrical. The goal of this project is to understand how molecules and nerve cells (neurons) generate these gender-specific behaviors. C. elegans is an animal model well suited for studies of behavior because genetic techniques are well-developed, the nervous system is well-characterized (the number and type of neurons do not vary significantly from individual to individual), and their wiring-how they are connected into circuits-is known. This project will use genetic techniques to identify and characterize molecules important for gender-specific behaviors, and laser microsurgery to identify neurons important for gender-specific behaviors. One of the eventual goals of this project is to test these models for how neural activity generates behavior. The C. elegans nervous system is simple enough that it should be possible to reprogram behavior. For example, hermaphrodites could be made to express the key behavioral genes of males, making the hermaphrodites attracted to other hermaphrodites. The project will train undergraduate students in genetics and neurobiology, and give them a practical basis for understanding fundamental principles. Additionally, this research will allow a postdoctoral fellow to establish a new area of scientific investigation and train him to become and independent investigator. The results from these studies will be made available by publication in open-access journals and presented to the public by the PI through community and university presentations.

KDD is usually a multiphase process involving numerous steps such as data preparation, data preprocessing, feature selection, rule induction, knowledge evaluation and deployment etc. Many novel data mining and learning algorithms have been developed, though vigorously, under rather add hoc and vague concepts. These algorithms, in most cases, are individual creations of different researchers, without much common methodological and fundamental framework. In other words, great majority of work in data mining is focused on algorithm development while neglecting the studies of fundamental theoretical issues concerning data, inter-data relationships, and quality of the implicit information hidden in the data or data redundancies. Thus, it is not easy to fully understand and evaluate how individual phase influences each other and the impact of each phase on the whole knowledge discovery process. For further development and breakthroughs in data mining and learning algorithms, a deep examination of its foundation is necessary. The central goal of the proposed research is to develop a unified rough set based data mining framework to explore various fundamental issues of data mining and learning algorithms. It aims to present the analytical capabilities of the methodology of rough sets in the context of data mining methodologies, techniques and applications. It will provide a unified framework to help better understand the whole KDD process.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Rough set theory is particularly suited to reasoning about imprecise or incomplete data and discovering relationships in the data. The simplicity and mathematical clarity of rough set theory makes it attractive for both theoreticians and application-oriented researchers. The main advantage of rough set theory is that it does not require any preliminary or additional information about the data, such as probability in statistics, basic probability assignment in Dempster-Shafer theory or the value of membership in fuzzy set theory. Rough set theory constitutes a sound basis for KDD and can be used in different phases of the KDD process. In particular, the formal techniques of rough set theory lead to many novel and promising breakthrough methods and algorithms for attribute functional, or<br/>partial functional dependencies, their discovery, analysis, and characterization, feature election, feature extraction, data reduction, decision rule generation, and pattern extraction (templates, association rules) etc., which are the fundamental issues of the KDD process. Rough set theory represents a new innovative approach and can lead to the development of new learning algorithms to create novel uses and breakthroughs of data mining techniques.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The proposed collaborative project is interdisciplinary in nature. It will synthesize often-disparate work in data mining, rough set theory and high performance computing. The PIs' strong multidisciplinary research collaboration experience will lead to widespread awareness and impact of the proposed research to rough set, data mining and high performance computing community. It will design and develop a wide-range of novel data mining algorithms and methods including data reduction, rule induction and classification ensemble in one unified framework to better understand the whole KDD<br/>process. These algorithms and methods will significantly extend the application scope of data mining techniques and rough set theory and will result in the improved understanding of issues involved in designing efficient and innovative data mining and learning algorithms and methods. The proposed research will integrate tightly with teaching activities, the research results will be developed into undergraduate and graduate courses and research projects. Part of this approach includes the development of new cross-disciplinary courses that bring together computer science and mathematics for the understanding of principle and methods of theoretical foundations of data mining and rough set theory. The integration will help with training students in the issues involved in the rough set theory, design and implementation of novel data mining methods and algorithms, high performance computing. The active participation of students will allow for significant exposure to the latest research in data<br/>mining.

Such devices, predicted to revolutionize portable chemical detection and analysis, are expected to generate over 2 billion dollars in income by 2010. The newest open format devices, based on actuation of free surface flows, i.e. liquid-liquid or gas-liquid interfaces, provide an especially attractive platform for highly sensitive detection of adsorbed species. Essential to the operation and control of these devices is development and integration of sensing arrays for high resolution, autonomous identification of sample position, volume, temperature, speed, composition and molecular species. This research program targets the development and integration of miniaturized optical, spectroscopic and electroactive sensors with thermofluidic chips. The three-part program includes (a) integration of thin film waveguides with open fluidic devices for evanescent sensing of stationary or moving samples, (b) development of a novel liquid-core waveguide based on thermocapillary actuation of microscale rivulets and (c) development of electroactive nanowell traps for electrostatic confinement and concentration of biomolecules. The waveguide sensors will be used to monitor droplet location, composition, rate constants for chromogenic reactions, and binding to functionalized quantum dots in a liquid suspension. Additional signal enhancement will be explored through evanescent coupling to micro-ring or micro-disc resonators fabricated on the chip surface. The electroactive nanowell sensor arrays positioned beneath stationary or moving droplets will allow development of an electrical impedance spectroscopic technique for use as an environmental sensor of aqueous borne bacterial pathogens. Sensor development and optimization will proceed through experiment, theoretical modeling and numerical simulations. The broader impacts of this grant are as follows: The interdisciplinary nature of the research will allow development of a novel fluidic chip with integrated sensing arrays and provide students with unique training at the crossroad of microscale transport phenomena and photonics, two high growth areas with numerous applications to bio- and nanotechnology. Undergraduates will be recruited through the NSF REU programs at Cornell and Princeton to aid with chip and nanowell fabrication, assembly of simple prototypes and data analysis. Students will be trained in the physical and engineering principles governing advanced optical and electrokinetic sensing platforms; they will also develop demonstration units for undergraduate lab courses and K-12 education. The Princeton PI will expand a current course on microfluidic phenomena to include a 2nd semester on sensing principles for miniaturized devices. She will also be leveraging this study toward establishment of a new Princeton Center on Advanced Fluidic Technologies, a large scale pilot program currently under consideration by the New Jersey Commission on Jobs Growth and Economic Development The Cornell PI will design a new course geared toward modern engineering and fabrication techniques of optical and spectroscopic sensors for lab-on-a-chip technologies. The PIs will jointly organize sessions on optofluidics and sensing at the IEEE Tranducers and SPIE Optical Information Systems meetings.

First, the investigator will show<br/>that one currently advocated approach for the analysis of data<br/>from multiple genes, the concatenation approach, can be<br/>statistically inconsistent, even when a consistent method of<br/>phylogenetic tree estimation is used. Second, an algorithm for<br/>maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of species trees from data on<br/>multiple genes under the coalescent model will be developed and<br/>implemented, and will be made freely available via the internet.<br/>The availability of a method for ML species tree estimation will<br/>allow for likelihood-based hypothesis testing of phylogeographic<br/>and population genetic hypotheses. Further, methods for assessing<br/>uncertainty in the species tree estimates will be developed by<br/>extending traditional bootstrapping methods in phylogenetics to<br/>the case in which data have been collected for multiple genes<br/>sampled randomly throughout the genome. Finally, tests for the<br/>adequacy of the coalescent model will be developed by examining<br/>whether the observed gene trees are consistent with a given<br/>species tree using several metrics to measure levels of<br/>incongruence.<br/><br/>The inference of the evolutionary history of a collection of organisms <br/>based on the information contained in their DNA sequences is a problem<br/>of fundamental importance in evolutionary biology. The abundance of DNA <br/>sequence data arising from genome sequencing projects has led to <br/>significant challenges in the inference of these phylogenetic <br/>relationships. Among these challenges is the inference of the evolutionary <br/>history of a collection of species based on DNA sequence information<br/>from several distinct genes sampled throughout the genome. This project <br/>studies the effect of the coalescent process on the inference of species <br/>phylogenies using data from multiple genes. This work will first <br/>demonstrate that failure to model the coalescent process can lead to <br/>incorrect inferences of species relationships. The investigator will then <br/>develop methods that can accurately estimate species phylogenies through <br/>explicitly modeling the coalescent process, and will apply these <br/>estimation procedures to construct techniques for hypothesis testing and <br/>for measuring uncertainty in estimated species phylogenies.<br/><br/>--

Both courses contain investigative laboratory modules (labs) that emphasize the process of science and data analysis relevant for science and social science students. Much of the material in the 1st course is being adapted from DUE-9950476 A Data-Oriented, Active Learning, Post-Calculus Introduction to Statistical Concepts, Methods, and Theory (ISCAT). The 2nd course extends ISCAT and utilizes integrative research-based lab methodology currently used in science courses at Grinnell College (partially funded by DUE-9950289). Labs in both courses are being developed so that they can be individually integrated into many courses in both undergraduate statistics and other disciplines.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is to contribute to the scholarship of statistics education by developing material that expands the successful reforms of the algebra-based introductory statistics course and inquiry-based science courses into early statistics courses designed for students with strong quantitative skills and interests. This collaborative project aims to deepen the statistical knowledge of undergraduates who are future scientists and quantitative social scientists in order to strengthen the interdisciplinary dialog between statisticians and scientific investigators in the future. The project also addresses a 2004 CUPM Guide recommendation by developing a series of labs that emphasize data analysis and encourage students to collect data, determine an appropriate technique for analysis, use technology, perform the analysis, make inference, interpret and then present the results. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project include creation of models for mathematics, technology and science students to develop interdisciplinary data analysis and research skills by creating a 2nd course in statistics that easily fits into existing curricula at many institutions. This allows institutions that may not be able to add new courses to their curriculum to incorporate a few labs into a standard probability course or other science courses, thereby increasing the quantitative skills of students majoring in other disciplines. The development of the laboratory modules brings together information across many disciplines and increases collaboration between faculty in the physical, biological and social sciences. This material is being disseminated through presentations at professional meetings, by publication in statistics education journals, and online at CAUSEweb (#DUE-0333672). As modeled by ISCAT, dissemination of these labs includes data and simulations that are accessible through a variety of data analysis tools such as Excel, Minitab, Stata, R, and java applets on the internet.

Examples of problems of direct interest are those arising in the control and coordination of multiple autonomous air and space vehicles, and in the detection and resolution of conflicts in Air Traffic Control. The techniques developed in this project are also applicable to other systems which require similar levels of reliability and performance, such as highway traffic automation systems, health care systems, power networks, and financial services.<br/><br/>Of particular interest for this project is a better understanding of the interactions between real-time software and dynamical systems. This will lead to new and powerful tools and techniques for the design and analysis of embedded systems, as well as an improved approach to the requirement specification for real-time systems.<br/><br/>The main core of the research project is aimed at dramatically reducing the complexity of embedded and hybrid systems design and verification by exploiting the geometric structure of the underlying physical system in the modelling effort, and by preserving this structure in the design of control laws and algorithms. This will make feasible for the analysis of the complete system, including its physical and software components, otherwise poorly scalable techniques such as abstract interpretation and model checking, and will provide the means for the effective use of techniques based on compositional<br/>reasoning.<br/><br/>For example, group symmetries in vehicle dynamics give rise to families of equivalent controlled trajectories: such sets are called motion primitives for single vehicles, and motion coordination primitives for groups of vehicles. A maneuver automaton is a collection of a finite number of motion primitives. In other words, a maneuver automaton is a discrete model of the vehicle dynamics, which leads to a dramatic reduction of the complexity of describing and controlling the vehicle behavior, by providing a high level of abstraction, and at the same time providing invariants which ensure that the physical state remains within some known bounds.<br/><br/>The educational part of the project is implemented through new course and curriculum development, and student mentoring. The main educational objective is to provide both undergraduate and graduate students with the knowledge and the skills to understand the key issues and to ensure technical leadership in the current and future aerospace information technology arenas. Finally, a special effort is devoted to the development of an interactive web site, where it is possible to access all the relevant information and software developed for the courses, and as a result of the research project.

An unfolding IRT model is a probabilistic model that simultaneously estimates each respondent's latent trait along with the characteristics of each item using the responses to a test or questionnaire. In contrast to traditional IRT models that implement cumulative item response functions to measure traits like ability and proficiency, unfolding IRT models incorporate single-peaked, nonmonotonic item response functions to measure constructs like attitudes, preferences and individual locations within certain developmental processes that occur in stages. This research program will expand the applicability, utility and popularity of a particular unfolding IRT model for polytomous responses known as the generalized graded unfolding model (GGUM). These goals will be achieved through an integrated sequence of educational and research projects. Research projects will include:<br/>1) An investigation of alternative indices of model, item and person fit that can be utilized with the GGUM - the results will enable practitioners to better identify when the GGUM is and is not appropriate for a given set of item responses. <br/>2) An exploration of Bayesian estimates of GGUM parameters derived from a Markov chain Monte Carlo method - this technique will potentially improve the accuracy of GGUM parameter estimates in situations with sparse data and will better represent the uncertainty inherent in those parameter estimates.<br/>3) The development of a new multidimensional extension of the GGUM - this model will allow for the measurement of multidimensional latent traits that are of interest to social scientists in many substantive areas like psychology, marketing, political science, etc. <br/>4) The development of a new mixture model that is based on the GGUM response function - this mixture model will estimate latent traits of conscientious respondents while probabilistically culling unconscientious respondents from the measurement portion of the algorithm.<br/><br/>The educational component of this program includes a series of both introductory and intensive workshops on the application and benefits of the GGUM family of models. Workshops will be developed and presented to applied measurement practitioners across the U.S. and Europe. The refinement and subsequent distribution of free, user-friendly computer software that estimates GGUM parameters will complement these educational activities. <br/><br/>Recent psychometric research suggests that responses to typical attitude and preference questionnaires are more appropriately described by unfolding models rather than cumulative models. Indeed, the use of cumulative models in these situations can lead to invalid measures. Unfolding IRT models will promote more valid measurement in these situations while also providing other benefits commonly associated with cumulative IRT models. These include the ability to build item banks that maintain a common scale of measurement, the ability to estimate the precision of each respondent's latent trait estimate, and the ability to measure attitudes, preferences and other constructs in the social sciences using computerized adaptive testing methods. Consequently, the results from this research can improve the quality of measurements that are developed in many social science disciplines while simultaneously expanding applied measurement practices in ways that are both technically sound and practical. The educational component of this program will provide measurement practitioners with the requisite knowledge and tools to effectively use this growing methodology.

These near-Earth objects (NEOs) are important scientifically as they are the most immediate and representative source bodies for the delivery of meteorites to the Earth. Currently NEOs have mostly unknown origins from locations within the main asteroid belt and from extinct comets. A multi-year commitment of observing time (~2 nights per month over an initial period of two years) has been made by the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) at Mauna Kea, Hawaii for the purpose of enabling routine reconnaissance of newly discovered NEOs. NSF funding of this project will support the acquisition of these reconnaissance observations resulting in new spectral data for 80 to 100 NEOs per year, where all new data obtained will be reduced and publicly released in near-real time. In short order, this new reconnaissance program will eclipse the current number (~140) of NEOs having near-infrared spectral measurements. The specific science goals for these reconnaissance observations are: (1) To relate, as closely as possible, NEO spectral characteristics with major meteorite classes. (2) To quantitatively determine the relative consistency (or lack thereof) between the NEO population classes measured in space and the meteorite population classes determined by fall statistics on Earth. (3) To identify, as well as possible, specific main-belt source regions for specific classes of NEOs, and in turn, illuminate solar system origin links for specific meteorite types. (4) To characterize the properties of NEOs in comet-like orbits for the objective of illuminating asteroid-comet connections, thereby constraining the comet source fraction for NEOs. (5) To measure the spectral characteristics of NEOs residing in orbits reachable with propulsion requirements < 7 km/sec, so that mission planning can be driven by scientific criteria (basic knowledge of the target properties) rather than by simple dynamical requirements. (6) Separately evaluate the compositional properties of the potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) subgroup, to illuminate any difference in the relative hazard posed by these most closely approaching objects compared with the broader NEO population. Dr. Binzel and his team bring extensive spectroscopic experience to this project with more than 10 refereed publications and ~140 NEO observations obtained within the first two years of the prior three year funding period, and a substantially longer track record in asteroid research.<br/><br/>The long-term interests of society dictate that we achieve an understanding of the NEO population for assessing their impact hazard and potential for natural resource utilization in space. Linking astronomical measurements of NEOs to laboratory measurements of meteorites provides a broad connection across different scientific disciplines. Identifying source regions for NEOs linked to meteorite classes anchors a wealth of laboratory meteorite data on solar system formation conditions to distinct locations as important boundary conditions for forming planets in our own solar system and beyond. The proximity of NEOs make them the most easily accessible destinations for spacecraft exploration, making their reconnaissance critical for both American and international space exploration planning, including possible future human missions and future utilization of NEOs as space resources. Finally, the IRTF observations are to be conducted by remote observing from the MIT campus, allowing the integration of research and education for a substantial number of students who could not otherwise travel to the telescope.<br/>***

For example, the Wisconsin Land Information System and the new Federal Geospatial One-Stop portals disseminate data and support procedures and simulations in emergency situations. However, geospatial data are complex and highly heterogeneous, having been developed independently by various levels of government and the private sector. This project includes metadata integration methods to enable more precise location of data sources over the web and to provide geospatial portals with query capabilities and semantic resolution for the types of information integration that could help in information discovery, problem-solving, or emergency response.<br/><br/>The research will develop methods and tools to support the integration of information in such a way that end users will have a homogeneous view over heterogeneous data sources. An ontology-based architecture will be developed with which each individual heterogeneous data source can be added to the network of information with relatively little effort. Ontology mappings will establish correspondences between terms in heterogeneous sources and those of standard models and ontologies. The approach also extends ontology mappings to incorporate semantics regarding spatial considerations, such as accuracy, for spatial integration.<br/><br/>Information integration is an area of research that stretches over databases, artificial intelligence, digital libraries, and the semantic web. This project will extend significantly the state of the art of information integration in general and of geospatial information integration in particular, by providing a robust and scalable framework that encompasses techniques and algorithms for integrating heterogeneous data sources using an ontology-based approach.<br/><br/>This project's goal of semantic integration for geospatial data fits into a broad vision for creating a cyberinfrastructure on the Web. In a geospatial cyberinfrastructure, data will be automatically located and semantically matched to other relevant data sources. Manual intervention will not be needed or will be minimal. With such a structure, emergency managers, government officials, and the general public will not be constrained to pre-formulated queries. Instead, ad hoc, exploratory queries and analyses will be possible. From an educational viewpoint, the project will significantly benefit the training of graduate and undergraduate students, in particular of women and minorities, and will include the design of new graduate and undergraduate courses.

That evidence is largely revealed in the detailed<br/>abundance patterns of old stars, which bear the fossil record of the Galaxy's gas chemistry at the time they<br/>formed. It has never been possible to obtain similar evidence in even one other normal galaxy. This is simply<br/>because old stars beyond the nearest dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Local Group are too faint to be<br/>observed at the high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution needed for abundance analysis.<br/>Unlike single stars, high-resolution spectra can be obtained of unresolved globular clusters at distances as<br/>large as 4 Mpc with current telescopes. Globular clusters are bright enough and have low enough velocity<br/>dispersions that even weak lines could be detected in spectra of their integrated light. Detailed abundances<br/>have never been obtained for unresolved globular clusters only because current methods of abundance<br/>analysis only work for individual stars. A method for abundance analysis of integrated-light spectra will<br/>make it possible to measure detailed abundances in the massive galaxies of the Local Group and well<br/>beyond.<br/>To develop this technique, a training set of resolved globular clusters in the Milky Way and Large<br/>Magellanic Cloud will be created. In these training set clusters, color magnitude diagrams and fiducial<br/>metallicities from single stars can be obtained, supplying a wealth of information for developing and testing<br/>the proposed method for analyzing the integrated light spectra of unresolved globular clusters. Crucially, the<br/>training set includes globular clusters of a wide range of ages and abundances, so that the necessary<br/>strategies can be developed to deal with such variations in unresolved globular clusters.<br/>Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of this technique, with reasonable abundances being derived<br/>from the integrated spectra of NGC 6397 and 47 Tucanae. However, a number of additions/improvements<br/>will also be added here. These include incorporation of blended lines in the synthesis (including the effects of<br/>hyperfine splitting), profile matching of strong lines, and consideration of possible non-local thermodynamic<br/>equilibrium effects. In addition, issues which may affect the confidence of the results will also be explored:<br/>horizontal branch morphology and what constraints can be applied through spectral indicators (e.g.,<br/>hydrogen line widths), the sensitivity to the luminosity function of stars at the low mass end, as well as the<br/>giants, and the importance of assumed alpha-element enhancements in the modeling process.<br/>This method for measuring abundances will let astronomers study the detailed chemical enrichment histories<br/>of galaxies beyond the Milky Way for the first time. This will dramatically increase the pool of observational<br/>constraints on galaxy formation theories and therefore have broad impact on our understanding of galaxy<br/>formation. The training set spectra themselves will also provide abundances of Magellanic Cloud clusters<br/>which are not yet well known, provide a calibration library for line index systems, and help astronomers<br/>understand the initial mass function of stars in globular clusters and the nucleosynthetic yields of supernovae.<br/>The training set spectra will also be made available through existing database as soon as they are published.<br/>A majority of the funding goes to supporting the training and education graduate students using state of the<br/>art observational facilities and computational tools.

The research will extend the PI's studies of fundamental reaction mechanisms occurring in the rearrangement of hydrocarbons. These investigations, utilizing sophisticated experimental techniques, offer particularly attractive opportunities to test modern theoretical predictions. The hydrocarbon rearrangements to be studied include the isomerization of cyclopropane to propylene, the reaction path leading from the pentamethylene diradical to propylene, conversion of vinylcyclobutanes into isomeric cyclohexenes, and isomerizations of 1,3-cycloalkadienes. The methods and techniques that will be employed in these experiments include organic synthesis, the use of stable isotopes, application of many different spectroscopic tools, and kinetic and stereochemical analyses.<br/><br/>These investigations of the mechanisms of hydrocarbon thermal rearrangements, which will provide fundamental new information on chemical reactivity, are expected to have significant impact on much of synthetic chemistry. A major positive benefit of this research will be the young scientists nurtured by participation in the project. These undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows will become part of the human capital so essential for new scientific advances.

The vast majority of studies of fertilization use selected marine invertebrate or mammalians species as model organisms. The proposed studies exploit genetic and molecular tools available for the insect Drosophila melanogaster to discover new cellular and molecular components required for sperm activation.<br/><br/>Primary tools for this investigation Drosophila strains that are male sterile due to defects in sperm activation. The mutants define a genetic pathway of five genes whose functions are required after sperm entry into the egg but prior to sperm nuclear decondensation and aster formation. The protein products of two genes, called sneaky (snky) and misfire (mfr), will be studied to understand their function in the dynamic changes that occur in the sperm plasma membrane, nucleus and acrosome. Both the Snky and Mfr proteins are predicted transmembrane proteins. Their localization in normal and mutant genetic backgrounds will be studied using antibody and protein fusion probes. Functional domains will be identified through directed mutagenesis and protein interaction studies. Effects on localization of other membrane proteins will be monitored to gain a better understanding of the overall distribution of proteins in the highly polarized sperm. This project also includes studies to identify the products of three other genes in the snky-class that have proposed roles in acrosome biogenesis and function.<br/><br/>(1) The intellectual merit of the proposed studies lies in its goal to understand the molecular mechanisms of fertilization. Previous work in this lab led to discovery of a large number of genes required for male fertility. This project focuses on a small subset required in a narrow window of time for the sperm to respond to the egg cytoplasm and undergo the changes essential to complete fertilization. The results obtained will be compared with the lessons learned from studies of extensively studied organisms such as marine invertebrates and mammals. This comparison should be informative since molecular studies indicate that the Snky and Mfr proteins are found in many animal species. As interesting, will be the discovery of species-specific molecular mechanisms that may provide insight into the diversity of reproductive strategies used by different organisms. (2) The broader impacts include its training value for young scientists. Portions of this project will constitute the dissertation research of two graduate students. In addition, this project relies heavily on the contributions of undergraduates. At least four undergraduates will gain their first experiences in research by participation in this work; the majority of which will be intentionally selected to enhance the diversity of students engaged in research at the University of Washington. Beginning students apply principles learned in their university coursework to genetic, molecular and cytological investigations of newly discovered mutations and contribute to an original scientific project. In addition, this work will generate valuable tools that can be used for the larger community of scientists who study Drosophila spermatogenesis and fertilization.

Dennis	11/30/2006	$280,000.00		stephen.spiro@utdallas.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	Atlanta	GA	303320420	4048944819	BIO	1112	1156, 9183, BIOT, 1112	$0.00	Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule in higher eukaryotes, and is a member of the arsenal of toxic molecules deployed against invading pathogens. NO is also generated as a byproduct of nitrate and nitrite respiration, so nitrate-respiring bacteria such as Escherichia coli are exposed to endogenously-generated NO. Thus, biological responses to NO are widespread in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and attract considerable interest. In E. coli and related enteric bacteria, a major regulator of the response to NO is the recently described transcriptional activator designated NorR. NorR activates the expression of a flavorubredoxin (that reduces NO to nitrous oxide) encoded by the norV gene, by binding to sites in the promoter region of norV and activating transcription catalyzed by RNA polymerase containing the alternative sigma 54 factor. In the denitrifying bacterium Ralstonia eutropha, NorR regulates expression of the norB gene encoding NO reductase, as well as a gene designated norA that is of unknown function but is widespread in the genomes of nitrate respiring organisms. The overall goals of the research are to further understanding of the mechanism by which NorR responds to NO and activates norV expression, to identify new members of the NorR regulon, and to explore the role of the norA (ytfE) gene in E. coli. Specific objectives are: (1) to identify residues in NorR that are involved in sensing NO; (2) to identify additional NorR-regulated genes in the E. coli genome, making use of an unbiased genome-wide search; (3) to evaluate the individual roles of the three NorR binding sites and the two IHF binding sites in the norV promoter region, and (4) to test the hypothesis that the product of the NO-inducible ytfE gene has a physiological role during nitrate and nitrite respiration, and to identify the regulator of ytfE expression. The broader impact of this research will involve the training and teaching of post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate researchers, and outreach to promote the science eduction of the broader community.

In the past twenty<br/>years or so, Hamilton has proved many remarkable theorems in the<br/>Ricci flow and developed a remarkable program to approach the<br/>Poincare conjecture and Thurston's geometrization conjecture<br/>using the Ricci flow. More recently, Perelman has made<br/>astounding breakthrough in the Ricci flow with the proof of a<br/>local injectivity radius estimate valid for all dimensions and<br/>used it to study the geometrization of three-manifolds. In<br/>addition to the applications of the Ricci flow to<br/>three-manifolds, many exciting possibilities remain. In this<br/>proposal, we propose to investigate several important problems in<br/>the Ricci flow and the Kaehler-Ricci flow which are of great<br/>interest in geometry, topology, nonlinear partial differential<br/>equations and complex analysis. They include studying<br/>stability/instability of Einstein metrics of positive scalar<br/>curvature (and more generally of shrinking Ricci solitons),<br/>constructing new Ricci solitons, seeking new Einstein metrics via<br/>the Ricci flow, aspects of geometrization of 4-manifolds,<br/>studying the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the<br/>Kaehler-Ricci flow on compact Kaehler manifolds with positive<br/>first Chern class, and the uniformization of complete noncompact<br/>Kaehler manifolds of positive curvature.<br/><br/>The Ricci flow is an important type of geometric flows (or<br/>geometric evolution equations) which have profound importance and<br/>applications in science and geometry. Examples of applications of<br/>other include the motion of a surface by its mean curvature, the<br/>flow of gas in a porous mechanism, the motion of a liquid<br/>crystal, the diffusion of oil in shale, the reproduction of<br/>sparse species, and image sharpening.

Many coastal environments depend on mangrove habitats to reduce erosion, buffer the influence of hurricanes and provide habitats for marine organisms. There is concern about the response of mangroves to future sea-level rise scenarios. However, laboratory and field experiments involving mangroves provide a limited temporal and spatial perspective of mangrove responses to environmental change. Our proposed research presents a novel approach to study past mangrove responses to environmental change throughout the Holocene (the last ~10,000 years), a period during which sea-level is known to have risen. The continuous deposits of mangrove peat present in Belize are the largest in the world and provide an exceptional resource to study past mangrove ecosystems over this period. A number of peat cores have already been collected and will be analyzed during this proposed project. We propose analyzing cores from three different sites to develop a robust picture of regional past mangrove ecology. One core (~8 m in depth) is from Twin Cays and a second core (~8 m in depth) is from Tobacco Range. These sites are ~12 km off of the mainland coast of Belize and are therefore less liable to be influenced by mainland tropical plant species. In addition, by analyzing a core (~6 m in depth) taken from coastal mangroves on the mainland, we will be able to compare and contrast coastal and island mangrove responses to Holocene sea-level changes. Ecosystem changes will be established by studying multiple lines of evidence (multiple proxies of the past vegetation) preserved in these peat cores, which are dated using radiocarbon dating. Peat cores will be analyzed for proxies that include counts of fossil pollen to track changes in vegetation composition, together with bulk and compound specific stable isotopic (C and N) techniques that will monitor physiological changes in mangroves with time. By analyzing a suite of proxies at each site, we will be able to develop detailed histories describing important aspects of these ecosystems, including factors such as species composition, plant morphology and structure, nutrient status and availability, peat accumulation rates, and physiological stress. By analyzing multiple sites, and multiple cores within a site, we will be able to distinguish between site-specific and regional trends, which will allow us to determine a robust assessment of overall ecosystem changes. In turn, these data will be compared with the framework of Holocene sea-level change for the region. We believe that our sites are among the best available to develop long-term records of mangrove ecosystems. Ultimately, knowledge of how these ecosystems responded to past environmental change is important in assessing how tropical ecosystems will function in response to future environmental changes.

Nathanson<br/>Nadia Islam<br/>Columbia University<br/><br/>The study seeks to determine how non-profit organizations (NPOs) representing South Asian immigrant workers in New York City balance the use of social movement activities (such as direct action tactics or advocacy efforts) with that of providing community public health services. The study aims to help us better understand how such South Asian NPOs reconcile the tension between service delivery, direct action, and advocacy, and the factors that play a role in their strategic decision making. Literature on social movement organizations indicates that organizations engage in different strategies when the state, funding institutions, or the organization's constituents legitimate new forms of action. Studies also show that organizations may attempt to combine forms of action in order to simultaneously engage in service delivery and social movement activities. Finally, studies indicate that an organization's identity and ideological commitments play a role in negotiating strategies. In this study immigrant workers' NPOs will be selected based on the primary strategy utilized by the organization (service delivery or direct action). Through completing case studies of two NPOs that serve South Asian immigrant workers, the study hopes to provide theoretical insights into how pressures toward accountability, ideological and identity commitments influence the way that NPOs negotiate between strategies of service delivery, direct action, and advocacy.

Electron beam lithography is the tool with the highest resolution, most able to cover the nano-scale range. This proposal establishes an electron beam lithography laboratory to propel a variety of nano-scale projects as diverse as DNA sequencing with ~2 nm channels to studies of solid-state phase transitions in extremely small solids. The proposed acquisition occurs within an increasingly rich nanoscale science and engineering environment created with substantial peer-reviewed Federal funds and internal funds from Vanderbilt University. This acquisition will open to Vanderbilt and other nearby universities (including a special arrangement with Fisk University), a first state of the art facility for nanolithography in Middle Tennessee. The participation of underrepresented groups will be enhanced by the close cooperation with faculty and students from Fisk University. Many of the Vanderbilt co-PIs have established research collaborations with Fisk. We expect to train numerous students able to advance the scientific and technological forefront of nano-scale science and engineering. Many of these students are part of the Vanderbilt-Fisk IGERT, focused on the theme of nanoscale materials science. The impact extends from educational opportunities in post-doctoral, graduates and undergraduates training afforded the graduate students to potential research breakthroughs in nanoscale materials science to technological applications that impact society. <br/><br/><br/>This proposal establishes a state of the art laboratory for precise fabrication of nanometer-scale structures that are 1,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. These include tiny fluidic channels and sensors, very small optical switches, and devices for observing and controlling single cells. The system will be housed in a state of the art clean room fabrication facility representing a multi-million dollar investment of Vanderbilt University funds, designed specifically to facilitate research in nanoscale materials science. This facility will accommodate senior researchers, postdoctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary environment organized around five fully equipped fabrication laboratories. A unique opportunity is created by the fact that the system will be installed in the same suite occupied by earlier instrumentation partly funded in 2001, thus completing a unique capability in the fabrication and optical characterization of small material structures.

The approach is threefold. First, the reliability structure of sensor systems will be studied based on system reliability theory and identifiability analysis. Second, efficient reliability analysis algorithms will be generated through investigation of analogues between sensor system reliability and network reliability models. Last, a method using penalty functions and exchange algorithms, which have been mostly used for optimum experimental design, will be applied for sensor placement design and reliability optimization. The models and algorithms will be verified and implemented in printed circuit assembly processes.<br/><br/>The success of this project will contribute significantly to the science base of system reliability modeling, analysis, and design for sensor systems used for variation source identification. Variation source identification using systems of sensors and sensor arrays is essential for manufacturing quality and productivity improvement, as well as signal source detection in various sensor array signal-processing applications. Sensor system failure in these applications may result in the loss of critical information, leading to numerous undesirable outcomes ranging from inferior manufacturing quality to catastrophic failure and even loss of human life in navigation, space, and defense applications. The methodology established in this research will enable designers to assure sensor system reliability by systematically incorporating system reliability information in the design phase. Design of reliable sensor systems for variation source identification will reduce manufacturing downtime, improve product quality, and in turn generate substantial economic impact on manufacturing industries.
0518316	Group Processes and Motivation Gains	BCS	SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY	08/15/2005	07/08/2005	Norbert Kerr	MI	Michigan State University	Standard Grant	Kellina Craig-Henderson	07/31/2009	$124,658.00		kerr@msu.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	East Lansing	MI	488242600	5173555040	SBE	1332	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Over the past 30 years, there has been considerable research showing that members of work groups often do not work as hard as comparable individual task performers. Such social loafing research has led some to suggest that task motivation is generally lower in groups or teams. However, in the last few years, there has been growing evidence that groups are not inherently or typically demotivating, but on the contrary, can sometimes result in increases in member task motivation. This proposal seeks to extend understanding of such group motivation gains by continuing a program of research on one such phenomenon, the Kohler effect. In seminal research with rowing teams, O. Kohler (1926) found that when the group's performance was defined by the least capable member's performance, that least capable member (the weak link) would work particularly hard. With prior NSF support (through Grant BCS-9974664), the Kohler effect's robustness has been established, a number of its boundary conditions have been determined, and most importantly, at least two psychological processes which underlie it have been identified [1. a competitive motive to avoid being identified as the weak link in the group, and 2. a cooperative motive to fulfill the special responsibility that comes with being the group's weak link]. This project extends this prior work by exploring how the Kohler motivation gain may depend upon a number of distinctive group processes. In particular, it will determine how the Kohler effect specifically [and group motivation gains more generally] depends on the nature of the work group itself. Nine experiments are proposed that focus on several important features of work groups-how group members feel about their fellow group members or the group as a whole, what group members expect of one another, the relationship between the group and the authorities that judge and reward them, whether the group works alone or competes against other groups, the culture from which the group members come, and how the ingroup (and outgroup) is composed. The project's primary significance lies in its potential to illuminate basic processes of motivation in groups, and thereby to provide useful knowledge that can be applied to maximizing workforce productivity in collective work contexts (e.g., work groups and teams).

Palka	09/30/2007	$149,482.00				Pasadena	CA	911010000		MPS	1253	0000, 1695, OTHR	$0.00	Combinatorial Number Theory, particularly in the areas of zero-sums and inverse problems, is a rapidly developing area of mathematics whose progress has advanced noticeably due to the successful introduction of many newly emerging methods with varied and disparate origins (including the polynomial method, linear algebraic techniques, Galois Theory, the use of combinatorial covers, the isoperimetric method, minimal zero-sums, exponential sums and other analytic techniques, and the partitioning of sequences into sets). While these and other methods have succeeded recently in solving many important open problems and conjectures from the field (such as the Kemnitz Conjecture), there remain considerable portions of the foundation of additive theory still unsolved. Only under very restricted circumstances do we fully understand the structure of a pair of sets (with elements from an arbitrary abelian group) with a small cardinality sumset or restricted sumset (for instance, for prime order groups there is the now established Erdos-Heilbronn conjecture, but much less of this nature is known for composite order groups). A similar state exists concerning the structure of sequences (with terms from an abelian group) that do not represent zero, represent zero minimally, or only represent a small number of elements, as a sum of some subsequence (with possibly fixed length). This project provides an MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MPS-DRF) to David J. Grynkiewicz in order to address these types of questions and to disperse and interweave the emerging methods in zero-sum and inverse additive theory in an effort to help create yet stronger techniques.<br/><br/>The collaborative research will be conducted principally at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia in Spain along with Oriol Serra, but will also entail shorter collaborative visits to work with Luis Gallardo, Georges Grekos, and Francois Hennecart of France, Weidong Gao of China, Alfred Geroldinger of Austria, and R. Thangadurai of India. A zero-sum workshop organized by G. Grekos, involving more researchers and students, will also occur during the corresponding collaborative visit in France. The importance of such research lies not just in its applications (results from zero-sum and additive theory have ranged from better understanding of non-unique factorizations in Krull Domains, to the structure of pairs of sets whose sum has small Haar Measure, to increased information about the range of diagonal and quadratic forms, and even to more complete knowledge about the range of parameters for partial difference sets), nor just in its intrinsic mathematical value, but also in the fact that the methods and techniques employed and developed to answer questions from zero-sum and additive theory, like many other areas of science outside of mathematics, lie across such a broad range of mathematics. Additionally, due to the international setting for the research, the project will foster lasting ties between US based researchers and their international counterparts.

The PI is building on a community-inclusive infrastructure that was established over an eight-year period. The plan of action for this program is, by necessity, adapted to the lifestyle of the community at large. As the population primarily survives by subsistence living, the families must hunt and fish during the summer months so as to acquire sufficicent commodities for the winter. Therefore, teachers and students will be active participants in the ACMP during the academic year. Using multiple technologies, including GIS and STELLA numerical modeling software, AMCP will infuse mathematical and physical science phenomenal themes, focusing on climatic impacts to the communities' daily lives. Each teacher will receive a mininum of 156 contact hours of instruction per year. Overall, this program will directly include 375 teachers and 5,100 students during its three years of operation.

The work explores applications of Rota-Baxter algebras to the renormalization process of perturbative quantum field theory and to other instances of the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. The project will also pursue connections of Rota-Baxter algebras with decompositions in quantum theory, combinatorics, and numerical solutions of differential equations. The algebraic aspect of this project considers the Rota-Baxter operator in connection with two other algebras whose products are defined by a generalization of the shuffle product, and as a sum of two binary operations. The close connections among these three algebras, which play prominent roles in physics, number theory, and combinatorics, will be considered in broader contexts. This investigation aims to contribute significantly to the theoretical understanding of these more general algebraic structures and their applications. The project will also explore the fundamental role played by Rota-Baxter operators and related operators in the study of multiple zeta values and their generalizations in number theory.<br/><br/>The Rota-Baxter operator is a generalization of the integration operator in analysis. The study of this operator was independently carried out by mathematicians, with motivation from probability theory, and by physicists, in connection with solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. Further important applications were subsequently found in several areas of physics and mathematics. Most striking is the relation of the operator to a recent algebraic approach to quantum field theory, which both clarifies the theoretical foundation of quantum field theory and substantially simplifies its calculations. The highly recursive, tree-like definition of the Rota-Baxter operator has also generated interest in its application to computational mathematics and combinatorics. This project studies the properties of the operator and generalizations of interest in mathematical physics, algebra, and number theory.

David L. Wild and Matthew J. Beal, of the Keck Graduate Institute in Claremont, California and the State University of New York in Buffalo, New York, respectively, are proposing to build statistical models of time series data, with a view to leveraging sophisticated Bayesian methods to reverse-engineer an organism's complex genetic regulatory networks from the raw measurements of gene expression and metabolite concentration.<br/><br/>Drs. Wild and Beal will apply their techniques to an ideal experimental system: the response of the bacterium E coli to acid stress, which enables pathogenic E. coli to survive passage through the acidic environment of the stomach and gastro-intestinal tract. They will collaborate with experimentalists Drs. Francesco Falciani and Mark Viant at the University of Birmingham, UK, who will provide data from both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of this bacterium. Predictions made by Wild and Beal's models can then be tested and explored back in the laboratory.<br/><br/>Recent advances in functional genomics technologies have given biologists unprecedented access to measurements of the inner workings of complex biological organisms. Using microarray expression profiling, it is now possible to measure the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes in just a single biological experiment, conducted over several days in the form of a time series. Contrast this to the situation only ten years ago when it was rather unusual for a biologist to measure the expression of more than just one or two carefully chosen genes. As well as high-throughput gene expression methods, the new technology of metabolomics has opened the door to measuring even more information in the form of the concentration of hundreds of metabolites that are also crucial players in the complex cellular processes under study.<br/><br/>This overwhelming amount of data challenges traditional methods of analysis, especially when one considers the element of time, because now one must consider how certain genes regulate the expression of other genes from one time point in the experiment to the next. <br/><br/>A key ingredient in Drs. Wild and Beal's models is the inclusion of hidden factors that help to explain the correlation structure of the observed measurements. These factors may correspond to unmeasured quantities that were not captured during the experiment and often reduce the number of direct gene-to-gene dependencies, leaving the resulting networks much more interpretable for the biologist. A natural question arises: how many hidden factors should be used to account for the dependencies in the observed data? This is answered by employing Bayesian model selection, a well-founded principle used in machine learning and statistics to choose between models of differing complexities. Their models also use a technique called Automatic Relevance Determination to further simplify the models so that only those genes and metabolites that are participating players in the process are retained in the final model.<br/><br/>Another advantage of the Bayesian framework is that existing information about known network connections and interactions, derived from the literature or commercial databases, can be included in the model. The output of the modeling procedure is a probabilistic reckoning of which genetic regulatory networks are plausible or not. These probabilities can be used to design future biological experiments targeted at specific genes, with a view to corroborating the model's in silico predictions or to simply probe a relatively uncharted network.

These lakes have been isolated for tens of millions of years. Unexplored at present, they may contain unique examples of life in an extreme environment, which will contribute to our understanding of life's origin and its potential for existence in icy regions throughout the solar system. Bottom sediments will also contain records of the unique geologic and glaciologic processes that led to lake formation. The report will define contamination standards and determine general environmental protocols for lake entry. Production of the report will involve discussion with the international scientific community, as well as stake-holding non-government organizations. The resulting report will be a useful educational resource for students of both subglacial research and environmental policy applied through international treaty.

Key here is the use of the Palomar Testbed Interferometer, which is the<br/>only dual beam optical interferometer in existence. Using the nearby companion in each binary as a<br/>reference, astrometric precision of 10-20 micro-arcseconds will be possible (almost 100 times better<br/>than is possible with a single dish optical system). Saturn-Jupiter mass planets with periods of a few<br/>years will therefore be detectable (possibly even Uranus-Neptune mass if 10 micro-arcseconds can<br/>be reached over long periods). Such a search of close binaries would be extremely difficult using<br/>traditional spectroscopic techniques and any planets found here will be of great value in<br/>constraining planet formation theories. A secondary outcome of this work is improved (by factors of<br/>10-100) orbits of dozens of close binaries from the target list, which when combined with radial<br/>velocities will lead to higher precision masses.<br/>A graduate student will be supported and be trained in interferometric techniques. This is a rapidly<br/>growing field and a significant demand for expertise is expected in the future.

The results will provide computational strategies and algorithms spanning multiple modeling scales (regulation of transcription, cellular energetic metabolism, cell-to-cell interactions, integrated organ contractile function). The project will develop methods for adaptive multiscale modeling, simulation and model reduction. The project will combine (a) modeling for myocyte- smooth muscle cell-endothelial cell interactions and the signals controlling them, (b) automated model reduction allowing adaptation of these cell types to changing states and more efficient computation in pseudo-steady states, and (c) parameter identification at subcellular to overall systems levels. The simulation results will provide new insights into the behavior of the physiological system by integrating models of cardiac and skeletal muscle systems showing adaptive responses to various physiological conditions that exist in both heart and skeletal muscles. The proposed research will initiate inter-disciplinary collaborations among faculty members and graduate students from engineering and life sciences at the University of Washington.

Pushing the limits of hardware and software technologies to extract the maximum performance, in turn, exacerbates other problems. Notable amongst these problems is the susceptibility to failures, which arises as a consequence of growing hardware transient errors, hardware device failures, software complexity, and the complex hardware/software inter-dependencies between the nodes of a parallel system. These failures can have substantial consequences on system performance, in addition to impacting the costs of maintenance/operation, thereby putting at risk the very motivation behind deploying these large scale systems.<br/><br/>This research is expected to make three broad contributions towards developing a runtime infrastructure, called PROGNOSIS, for failure data collection and online analysis. The first set of contributions will be on collecting and analyzing system events and failure data from an actual BlueGene/L system over an extended period of time. In addition to presenting the raw system events, the research will be developing filtering techniques to remove unimportant information and identifying stationary intervals, together with defining the attributes for logging and their frequency. The second set of contributions will be models for online analysis and prediction of evolving failure data by exploiting correlations between system events over time, across the nodes, and with respect to external factors such as imposed workload and operating temperature. The third set of contributions will be on demonstrating the uses of PROGNOSIS. Tools such as PROGNOSIS can help substantially in the development of self-healing systems, which has been noted to be an important goal in the emerging area of Autonomic Computing by several computer vendors.

Coping with errors, and devising methods to detect and automatically correct errors, is one of the persistent challenges to the theory of information. This project investigates a collection of fundamental problems in this theory. <br/>The problems are unified by their goals as well as methods under consideration. The central goal is to improve the efficiency of communication and of the associated computational tasks for very general <br/>error models. The methods to be investigated include algebraic techniques over finite fields, and techniques<br/>from the theory of computer science.<br/><br/>Algebraic methods have long contributed to the foundations of error-correcting codes. The principal examples are the Reed-Solomon codes and their decoding algorithms which have paved the way for much of the reliability of digital storage media. All CDs and DVDs are encoded with Reed-Solomon codes, and CD- and DVD-players come equipped with error-correcting algorithms for these codes. Recent research, including some previous work of the PI, has shown that the algebraic methods can be pushed even further to correct more error, and deal with a further diversity of reliability information when dealing with erroneous channels. Yet some fundamental questions remain unanswered, even about Reed-Solomon codes. A simple question is: What is the fraction of random error that can be corrected in Reed-Solomon codes, with efficient algorithms? This, and other such fundamental questions about algebraic codes, are investigated in this project. The project also investigates the applicability of new techniques developed in theoretical computer science in the context of some classical challenges in coding theory.

It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This equipment will enhance research in a number of cutting-edge fields within chemistry, ranging from synthesis/catalysis, to spectroscopy/photochemistry, to supramolecular/nanostructured materials chemistry, to chemical biology/medicinal chemistry.

In particular, the study of the light elements, lithium, beryllium, and boron, is important in many areas of modern astrophysics, such as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the origin of the elements, Galactic chemical evolution, stellar interiors and evolution.<br/><br/>Here, three projects will be carried out. The first is the determination of beryllium abundances in the oldest stars with metal contents lower than one one-thousandth that of the sun. If a plateau in beryllium abundances is found among such stars, it will imply an inhomogeneity in the early universe with high-density proton-rich bubbles. The second project is a study of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy through the growth in the beryllium content over time. The enrichment of various chemical elements in the Galaxy reveals the history of formation of massive stars and the early production of supernovae. Tracking the increase of beryllium over time gives sensitive information about previous generations of stars. Probing both the earliest times (via observations of stars with low metal contents) and the intermediate ages will result in a greater understanding of the evolution of the Galaxy. Finally, most stars of low metallicity have a similar lithium content due to the production of lithium during the Big Bang. However, some of these very old stars are deficient in lithium. In the third project, by determining the beryllium content in the lithium-deficient old stars, two competing theories of the origin of the lithium depletions will be tested (mixing, which should destroy lithium but not beryllium, and mass transfer, which should deplete both elements). Understanding this will illuminate stellar mixing processes and the primordial lithium value.<br/><br/>This research will take advantage of two of the world's largest telescopes: the Keck-I 10-m telescope and the Subaru 8.2-m telescope at the Manna Kea Observatory. Graduate students will be supported and trained to use these telescopes and conduct research in the compositions of stars.

To build and sustain our network we are carrying out four linked activities: 1) a two-week summer program for high-school freshman that each year exposes 30 students and 6 teachers to a variety of topics in the geosciences and demonstrates how the chemistry and physics covered in freshman science courses integrates with geoscience; 2) a follow-up program with teachers that will assure integration of geoscience-related lessons into the ninth grade integrated physics and chemistry curriculum, 3) a mentoring and research experience for eight undergraduates each year and 4) a fellowship program for two Ph.D. students each year. Anticipated outcomes from our work include models for: 1) a recruitment and training network that works for geoscience; 2) preparing teachers to incorporate geoscience activities into physics and chemistry curricula and for assessing their effectiveness; and 3) a vertical mentoring structure that stretches from high-school students and teachers through undergraduate students to Ph.D. candidates that promotes both student success and interest in geoscience. By creating a network that encompasses all aspects of the geoscience pipeline from the K-12 schools to the Ph.D. in one location with a large Hispanic American population, we expect to make a major contribution to changing the demographics of the future geoscience workforce.

Six interrelated research tasks are planned. In Task 1, a functional experimental system for ultrasonic cavitation based casting will be developed to demonstrate scalability for high volume production. Task 2 focuses on the understanding of the process by monitoring transient cavitation activities and on the optimization of the process to achieve uniform nanoparticle dispersion in Mg melt. Task 3 is to characterize the micro/nano structure of the resultant nanocomposites. The dislocation structure in the matrix around nanoparticles will be examined to understand the mechanism of strengthening by nanoparticles. Task 4 will perform multi-scale modeling of cast Mg nanocomposites to develop a fundamental and quantitative understanding of how the nanoscale structure influences properties. Task 5 will experimentally characterize the effect of nanoparticles on the mechanical properties (at elevated temperatures as well as at room temperature) of cast Mg matrix nanocomposites by tensile, creep, in-situ deformation and fatigue studies, nano-indentation, fracture-toughness, and tool-wear testing. Task 6 is to establish the processing/structure/property relationships by correlating the ultrasonic cavitation activities with the results from the experimental and analytical studies.<br/>Cast bulk Mg alloy matrix nanocomposites can have a widespread impact on the automobile and aerospace industries by significantly improving the vehicle energy efficiency and performance. The educational components include multi-campus curriculum development at University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of California-Davis, and Georgia Institute of Technology, research student exchange, and a Nanotechnology Awareness Program (NAP) to attract and engage students (from colleges and high schools) and Technology Education teachers, especially those from underrepresented groups. Outreach activities will expose more K-12 students, teachers, and industries to nanotechnology.

Highly developed non-LTE molecular hydrogen (H2) is expected in comet comae, and recent evidence shows the presence of significant abundance of this species. The role of activated hydrogen has not been previously investigated. The role of molecular hydrogen will be explored theoretically to determine the extent to which transitions in this system contribute to the large number of unidentified emission lines that have been found in FUSE Observatory observations, and furthermore examine the level of importance activated H2 may hold in the overall development of comet comae. High resolution measurements of comet comae using the FUSE facility have identified emission lines from H2 bands stimulated by the solar H Ly alpha line.<br/>The two comets investigated showing these features also contain of order 50 emission lines between 900 and 1100 Angstrom that have not been identified. Preliminary investigation for this project has indicated a large number of the features correspond to transitions in H2 electronic systems. This region, however, contains of order 50,000 lines of the H2 electronic systems, and therefore a high probability exists that many H2 transitions would correlate with the observed features without constituting identification of origin. The early investigation has identified possible H2 lines in the spectra of comet C/2001 A2(LINEAR) that arise from very large rotational levels, such as J = 11, and 12. This is plausible because rotational levels in the H2 ground state have extremely long radiative lifetimes, and H2 is expected to be produced in extreme non-LTE states in the physical chemistry of the coma. A physical chemistry architecture has been developed for hydrogen at the University of Southern California that establishes chemical and physical rate processes at the rotational structure level, so that no assumptions are necessary in the model calculations in regard to the thermal condition of the gas. That is, the state of the gas is established only on the basis of the forcing functions, diffusion properties, and gas density in the activated volume. A preliminary investigation will be conducted to assess the scope of complexity required to address the role of activated hydrogen through the examination of the observed spectra against the theoretical model, which would include consideration of physical chemistry involving the non hydrogen species in the comet coma as reactants and sources. <br/><br/>The detailed hydrogen physical chemistry to be investigated here has never previously been examined for the comet coma environment. The starting point for this project is a fully developed detailed architecture for non-LTE hydrogen reactions at the rotational quantum number level, allowing generation of detailed predicted emission spectra, and exploration of the overall effect of activated hydrogen on the chemistry of the coma.. The development of magnetohydrodynamic MHD codes in recent years has provided a platform for remarkable advancement of global modeling of comet processes. The structure to be refined in the present effort would allow the introduction of non-LTE detail into these developed MHD programs.<br/>***

The proposed instrument will be housed in the Center for Electron Microscopy and Nanofabrication (CEMN) at PSU. The CEMN is a multi-user facility consisting of a several state-of-the-art high resolution electron microscopes and a well equipped specimen preparation laboratory. It serves PSU's researchers and students and those from other universities and technical personnel from local high-tech companies.

However, current industrial efforts in Model Driven Architectures (MDA) generally lack rigorous foundations, and their full potential for embedded system development is yet to be demonstrated. The exploratory research in this project addresses these issues in the following research thrusts:<br/><br/>(1). The project develops formal foundations for a concrete MDA approach based on Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs). A central component of the exploratory research investigates whether graph transformation systems can provide a suitable technology framework for practical model transformation and software generation.<br/>(2). The project applies the results of research in the domain of distributed, real-time embedded systems by building specialized DSML-s for embedded applications, and demonstrating how software can be generated for different platforms from the same code base. <br/><br/>The project seeks to advance knowledge about constructing complex embedded software systems by exploring: domain-specific models for embedded applications, formal model transformation, and platform-dependent software synthesis from models. The broader, societal impact of this research lies in the importance of rigorous methods for building and maintaining complex real-time embedded system applications that are safe and reliable.

Building on existing work this project aims at giving further examples of blowup solutions, understanding their stability properties, and identifying assumptions guaranteeing global existence of large solutions.<br/><br/>(B) Existence and qualitative properties of solutions for particular <br/>systems of multi-dimensional systems of conservation laws. Multi-dimensional equations display an exceedingly rich<br/>variety of behaviors and there is currently no general existence <br/>result available for global solutions. Recent examples of blowup demonstrate that the small variation theory for one-dimensional<br/>systems cannot be generalized to several space dimensions. The <br/>research aims at a bottom-up approach where insight is obtained from specific cases.<br/> The systems will be chosen to provide simplified, but non-trivial, examples with strong structural constraints. The goal is to create a toolbox of methods that can be applied to more general systems. Both analytical and numerical tools will be employed to gain insight into the structure of the solutions.<br/><br/>(C) The Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow provide a basic<br/>model of importance in a wide range of applications. The goal of this <br/>project is to investigate three issues: formation of vacuums (cavitation), the effect of including temperature dependence in the transport coefficients (viscosities and heat conductivity), and multi-dimensional flows with large amplitudes. The various projects will also address the significant numerical challenges one faces in computing large or multi-dimensional solutions, and flows containing vacuums. Vice versa, exact solutions<br/>will be used to benchmark various computational codes.<br/><br/>The projects aims at a better understanding of how nonlinear mechanisms <br/>interact with one- or multi-dimensional effects in equations that are extensively used in physical models, ranging from properties of materials and to fluid flow and meteorology. While these issues are of independent theoretical interest they are also of obvious importance in applications to Science and Engineering. Several of the projects require development and testing of high performance computer codes with <br/>important applications in everyday simulations. A combined approach of analytical techniques, modeling, and numerical calculations will enhance basic understanding of fluid flow and its applications.

Currently, commercial circular dichroism spectrometers are only available for steady state operations. However, monitoring the real-time change of a circular dichroism spectrum provides both structural and dynamical information about molecular systems. Up to now laboratory-stage experimental setups for time resolved CD measurements were designed to monitor dynamics in the time range of millisecond to picoseconds. Earlier attempts to measure ultrafast time-resolved CD spectra (on the picosecond time scale) utilized tunable laser pulses combined with single-wavelength detection schemes. Thus instead of measuring the entire CD spectrum simultaneously it had to be reconstructed point by point which exacerbates the data acquisition and data analysis procedure significantly. Prof. Fiebig will design and construct a broadband femtosecond time-resolved circular dichroism spectrometer with the capability of simultaneously acquiring data over a large spectral region (ultraviolet to near infrared). <br/><br/>This instrument will be a very powerful tool in studies of protein folding and molecular recognition.

The best known questions concern the location of genes and mutations that contribute to disease incidence and to variation in economically important traits. Nature and history have created a large variety of mosaic genomes among individuals and populations who can be studied today. The grand challenge is to exploit these natural experiments by finding patterns in and among the different mosaic genomes (the genotypes) that have significant and biologically meaningful associations with important traits (the phenotypes) of interest. With genomic level technologies, the needed data on population level variation is becoming available but challenging problems remain in the analysis of the data.<br/><br/>This proposal focuses on novel, critical computational problems that arise in population-scale genomic data acquisition and analysis. The algorithmic problems of concern are divided into biology-based problems and technology-based problems, but the interplay of technology and biology is critical. This research will be conducted by an interdisciplinary group of computer scientists, mathematicians and geneticists. The main biology-based algorithmic problems concern the computational deduction of the frequency, location, and the full temporal structure of historical recombination, gene-conversion and lateral gene- transfer. The main technology-based problems are concerned with important problems of missing data or error-prone data, and with the deduction of haplotype data from genotype data. The problems of missing or error-prone data are approached through the use of optimization techniques. The haplotype deduction problem uses a variety of techniques, based on exploiting more complete and realistic biological models of how the underlying haplotypes have evolved. One element is the incorporation of recombination into the models, connecting previous work on constructing histories of recombinations with work on deducing haplotypes from genotypes.<br/><br/>The algorithms and software will allow biologists to better understand the history<br/>and role of recombination, gene-conversion and lateral gene transfer, and to cope with problems in the data. As just two examples, the tools could facilitate the tasks of gene finding by association mapping, and in understanding how lateral gene-transfer helps bacteria to rapidly develop antibiotic resistance. The impact will be enhanced by our associated educational and outreach efforts.

The Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute (MTBI)- devoted to the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the application of mathematics will: (1) recruit and select summer REU students; (2) guarantee sequential research summer opportunities for undergraduates; (3) keep track of their academic status after leaving the program for three years; and (4) prepare the students for graduate school and/or future employment. <br/><br/>The program is part of a systemic effort that will insure the successful transition of selected students from community college and colleges will enroll in a graduate graduate program in the mathematical sciences. The MTBI long-term overarching goal is to build a large community of researchers from which additional Ph.D.'s in the mathematical sciences primarily from underrepresented groups will emerge. It is anticipated that this project, like our previous REU (MTBI) projects, will succeed in increasing the enrollment and the graduation of students from groups that have traditionally been underrepresented in the mathematical sciences or in fields that demand strong mathematical training. For example, MTBI has served 220 undergraduate students over nine years-with many participating in two or more sequential summer research experiences selecting between 23 and 36 undergraduate participants each summer. The success of MTBI's programs is evident from the number of its alumni who continue on to graduate school. Specifically, the total percentage of underrepresented minority alumni of MTBI in graduate school is 62.5% (87 out of 139); the percentage pursuing Ph.D.'s is 34.5% (48 out of 139); the percentage of women in graduate school is 64% (64 out of 100); the percentage of women pursuing Ph.D.'s is 29% (29 out of 100). Participation in MTBI provided the research experience, mentorship and support needed to successfully continue their studies in mathematics. The proposed program will establish a model for education through research in a collaborative setting that focuses on actions at critical transition points from college to the Ph.D. level. The goal is that this model will instigate systemic and large-scale educational and mentorship changes at ASU and other emergent urban universities.

These reagents are easily resolved in a sequential manner producing both enantiomerically pure forms of the reagents. Reaction of these complexes with Grignard reagents directly provides B-allyl-, allenyl-, or propargyl-10R-BBDs, quantitatively, as stable, isolable compounds in enantiomerically pure form. The corresponding B-crotyl (E and Z) and Z-gamma-OR-allyl reagents are also readily prepared from the enantiomerically pure B-MeO-10R-9-BBDs. The 10-TMS and 10-Ph reagents are specifically tailored for extremely enantioselective additions to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The specific goals of this project are to develop new chemistry with these robust chiral boranes, including 1) asymmetric allylboration with novel 2-boryl-1,3-dienes potentially leading to chiral beta-allenyl carbinols, 2) asymmetric gamma-methoxyallylboration of ketones with a fostriecin application, 3) asymmetric Suzuki-Miyaura coupling and allenylation potentially giving chiral allenes and beta-TMS homopropargylic alcohols with high diastereo- and enantioselectivity, 4) conjugate additions of B-alkynyl-BBDs to enones and N-acylimines, 5) asymmetric propargylboration of ketones, and 6) asymmetric hydroboration of 1,1-disubstituted alkenes to give non-racemic products which are suitable for asymmetric Suzuki-Miyaura alkyl coupling.<br/><br/>With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. John A. Soderquist of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Puerto Rico.  Professor Soderquist and his students will study the synthesis and reaction chemistry of compounds containing bonds between carbon and boron. These new organoborane reagents are expected to equal or exceed the selectivities reported for other known reagents or processes while offering great versatility as well as ease of preparation, handling and recycling. These studies utilize the rigid, robust bicyclic nature of the organoboranes to create a stable, enzyme-like environment for orchestrating highly selective and controlled reactions. This methodology offers promise for a variety of synthetic applications in research and in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.

Yet few students ever have the opportunity to study science on-site in Antarctica because of the obvious limitations resulting from the remoteness of this continent. This project will support a series of advanced level, graduate training courses that will be organized and taught on site in Antarctica. These courses will be open to Ph.D. students and postdoctoral-level scientists interested in the study of biological adaptations of Antarctic marine organisms. Each of the three austral summer courses will be offered for approximately twenty students over a five-year period in Antarctica, in January 2006, 2008 and 2010. These courses will be held at McMurdo Station, the major base in Antarctica of the United States Antarctic Program. This NSF-supported research station has well equipped laboratories for the kinds of educational and student research activities that will be undertaken in the proposed courses. The major goal of these courses is to introduce students and new postdoctoral-level investigators to Antarctic science through studies of the diversity of life forms and the mechanisms of biological adaptation of Antarctic marine organisms. The courses will introduce an international group of students to a wide range of Antarctic organisms, including vertebrates, invertebrates, algae and microbes. Lead instructors with considerable experience with organizing and teaching such advanced educational programs in Antarctica in the past will participate in the program A further aim of the proposed courses is to train all the participants in approaches to integrative biology, by having them study unique biological processes in the cold biosphere that span several different levels of biological organization. For instance, long-standing questions in evolution (e.g., cold adaptation) and ecology concerning the biology of Antarctic organisms will be examined with 1) physiological studies of whole organisms; 2) studies of isolated cells and tissues; 3) experiments on protein structure and function; and 4) molecular analysis of genetic systems. These Antarctic courses will have an educationally intense format similar to summer courses that have been offered in the past at US-based marine laboratories, an approach that has been very successful at introducing new students to important fields of biology. The general format of the Antarctic courses will consist of field collections and laboratory experiments, together with many lectures on polar science from course faculty and guest speakers. Some of the specific themes to be covered during the courses in Antarctica will include: biological diversity; biochemical adaptation; cold adaptation; energy metabolism; molecular phylogeny; and UV photobiology. These themes will be interwoven during the courses with independent, student-initiated research projects. Antarctica is a difficult place to do science. This is especially true for first-time, new investigators starting their careers. The proposed courses will introduce students to the hands-on doing of science under realistic Antarctic conditions. The major expectations from offering these training courses in Antarctica will be to introduce new researchers to the biological processes in that extreme environment and to train such students in modern research methods to understand the mechanisms that are unique to biology in Antarctica.

Because of the small effective mass of the charge carriers, the electronic transport in bismuth nanowires is strongly quantum-mechanical in nature. Apart from interesting quantum effects, bismuth nanowires are also interesting for some applications. For example, bulk bismuth is a very efficient thermoelectric material, which can provide a solid state cooling method that involves neither mechanical parts that wear down nor fluorocarbons that damage the environment. Theoretical models of electronic transport predict that the cooling efficiency of fine bismuth nanowires is substantially enhanced over that of the bulk material. Thus, there is a potential for developing a practical cooling method for high-temperature superconductor applications and miniature refrigerators. The work supported by this award involves the synthesis of small diameter (few tens of a nanometer) bismuth wires and measurements of the electrical resistance and response to high magnetic fields at very low temperatures. The experimental results will be compared with theoretical predictions. Researchers and students from Howard University and Boston College participate collaboratively in carrying out this research. The project will train students at doctoral and undergraduate level in nanoscience and technology, thus preparing them for careers in academe, industry, or government. Strong African-American student participation is anticipated.<br/><br/><br/>*** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT ***<br/>This project investigates the evolution of the Fermi surface of bismuth from bulk semimetal to quantum nanowire. Theoretically, for wire diameters near 60 nm, quantum confinement causes a semimetal-semiconductor transition to a state of large thermopower. However, surface states may mask this transition. Also, it has been predicted that for a strictly one-dimensional interacting electronic system the Fermi liquid description of electrons and holes does not apply, and the excitation spectrum of one-dimensional systems (Luttinger liquid) consists of charge and spin density waves. The goal of this research project is to understand these phenomena through an experimental study of electronic transport, thermoelectricity and magnetism down to very low temperatures (0.3 K) and for magnetic fields up to 47 T. Since these nanowires display Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen oscillations, which enable direct study of the Fermi surface of bulk conductors, this project aims at extending the experimental methods and the physical picture of Landau states to low-dimensional conductors. This project is a collaboration between Howard University and Boston College and involves training of graduate and undergraduate students. A major focus of the student training is to offer career advancement opportunities for several African-American students at Howard University.

Thus, understanding the evolution of microstructures in solids is a fundamental problem in materials science. Simulations in the presence of numerous evolving interfaces pose mathematical and computational challenges, especially in three dimensions. This interdisciplinary research and training program focuses on developing mathematical models and computational techniques to overcome the challenges of computationally studying surface defects in solids and coarsening in solid-solid and solid-liquid systems. The mathematical impacts of the study will include accurate and fast numerical methods for microstructural evolution in three dimensions and for evolution of defects on solid surfaces, using boundary integral methods and incorporating both diffusional and elastic effects. These techniques will be applied to (1) investigate coarsening in solid-solid and solid-liquid systems by performing two- and three-dimensional simulations, and (2) examine step flows (motion of atomic-height steps) on solid surfaces in three dimensions. These investigations will provide insights into materials issues encountered in high-temperature alloys and semiconductor thin film growth. Close collaborations with experimentalists will allow comparisons of the simulation and experimental results. The equations governing the proposed material systems are closely related to a host of mathematical descriptions for pattern formation in moving boundary problems. Therefore, the proposed modeling and computational techniques will have broad applications and will provide new tools for other research areas. Importantly, the proposed program will provide excellent training opportunities for graduate students interested in research at the interface of mathematics, computation, and engineering.

Rokita at the University of Maryland- College Park who proposes to explore research at the interface of chemistry and biochemistry in order to develop a predictive understanding of how low molecular weight reagents react with their biological targets. The research will identify the time-dependent evolution of quinone methide adducts in duplex DNA and assess, in a fundamental manner, the impact of reversibility on macromolecular reaction. A new assay relying on oxidative trapping has been developed so that transient products formed in duplex DNA may finally receive the same scrutiny previously afforded to only individual nucleotides. The role of nucleotide sequence in quinone methide regeneration will also be determined since formation and reaction of this intermediate have previously shown sensitivity to solvent conditions. As a complement to studies on electron transfer in DNA, further investigations will measure the ability of DNA to act as a conduit for electrophile (quinone methide) migration that may otherwise be quenched by competing nucleophiles in a biochemical system. The results of this proposal should provide a conceptual foundation for how the reversibility of covalent reaction can profoundly affect the lifetime and target selectivity of transient intermediates forming DNA adducts.<br/><br/>The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Steven E. Rokita who will explore the fundamental physical organic chemistry underlying the reaction of quinone methides with nucleic acids. Professor Rokita has discovered that quinone methides can react with DNA to form reversible covalent bonds. The concept of reversible covalent interactions with DNA has been recognized for years but only recently has it been appreciated for its potential significance in understanding cellular responses to DNA damage. This work has significant implications for our basic understanding of the interactions of drugs and toxins with DNA, for understanding the chemical basis for cellular responses to DNA damage, and ultimately for designing DNA-reactive therapeutics for many human diseases. The planned investigations span the disciplines of chemistry and biochemistry and have attracted a number of students at all levels, many of which are underrepresented in science. Efforts will continue to ensure that such students participate in this research and share the experience with their colleagues by participating in departmental and college programs serving minorities, high school teachers and their students.

Advancement in wireless sensing and networking have provided convenient and flexible information delivery, and it can also extend our control scope by expanding our space accessibility, thus empowering control systems toward challenging applications in hospitals, robotics control, and manufacturing plants, etc. Driven by real-world demands, many of these applications are characterized by timing constraints that must be satisfied for proper operation, i.e., quick response to external events. Moreover, for remote control, task directives are sensitive in that any alteration or damage will induce erroneous actions, decisions, and even widespread destruction. Thus, the contradiction of random network delay and time-sensitive commands, and open fields and sensitive data transmission makes wireless network-based control systems significantly challenging.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This research plan concerns not only the development of data-sensitive control systems, it also studies the design of transport algorithms and computing models which play an important role in facilitating real-time control based on wireless sensing and networking. By integrating a middleware-based approach to compensate for random network delay, we will apply our solutions to time-sensitive, feedback control systems in a case study for motion tracking and control.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The results of such a wireless network-based control system, which integrates multidisciplinary characteristics, will be used to reveal great potential for industrial electronics, health care, and robotics, and will make a significant impact on people's daily lives. This work will also be used as an experimental concentration for innovative curriculum design of intelligent control. Research and educational results will be broadly disseminated and made available to the public by being posted on the Internet in a timely manner.

For these reasons, it is becoming increasingly important for engineers to reason quantitatively about the various systems' properties of interest and curb their design, development, and deployment costs. In an ideal situation important system characteristics, such as performance and reliability, would be assessed at system design time, before significant time and cost have been devoted to a project. However, making useful (quantitative) predictions in early design stages is difficult at best, due ti the interplay between many relevant factors, such as complex properties of software components, the potential effects on software of the firmware (hardware, OS, device drivers), as well as the potentially conflicting desired system attributes.<br/><br/>Attacking even a small subset of these problems is challenging enough and would result in significant advances to the state of the art in complex systems engineering. Hence, this project proposes to focus efforts on design-time evaluation of architectures with respect to one key attribute - reliability. Here, reliability is defined as the probability that the system will perform its intended functionality under specified design limits. The proposed approach will enable an engineer to build a multi-faceted, hierarchical model of a system and assess its reliability in an incremental, scalable fashion. Although several software reliability techniques exist, they are insufficient. To address these deficiencies, the project will develop a technique that will couple software architectural models (well understood by system designers) with augmented Hidden Markov Models (which allow us to reason about numerous uncertainties existing in early design phases), and will augment this methodology with the relevant attributes of the firmware in support of more complete and meaningful reliability models.<br/><br/>The project will evaluate the results the methods developed along two measures of interest: tractability (intended to address scalability issues existing in real, complex systems) and sensitivity (intended to address issues of confidence in the researchers predictions under numerous uncertainties existing at design time) and will apply the results to real problems from the domain of mobile robotics, a problem domain that is representative of many complex, distributed, and embedded systems.

Testing and refining the concept of steady-state mountain building requires identification of cases of transient response and dynamic feedback in compressive orogens, and documentation of the spatial and temporal scales at which crustal deformation responds to erosion. This project takes advantage of a unique natural experiment in the active fold-thrust belt of west-central Taiwan where enough modern seismologic, geodetic, structural and geochronologic data exist to assess how an orogen responds to rapid and abrupt changes in wedge volume at scales of tens of kilometers. The Puli embayment in the west-central Taiwan lies approximately 1.5 km lower than neighboring parts of the fold-thrust belt. Geologic and geodetic evidence suggests that thrusting occurs over the width of the topographic embayment, rather than being concentrated at the front of the thrust belt, as is the case in the adjacent part of the thrust belt to the south where the topography maintains a classic wedge shape. The hypothesized connection between strain and topographic gradients is tested by (a) development of a database of late Quaternary slip rates and deformation patterns using a combination of structural, geochronologic and geomorphic methods, and (b) use of a 3D finite element model to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions required to produce the observed topography and deformation patterns. Fault-slip rates are obtained via dating of deformed stream terrace and basin fill deposits. Age dating also enables testing and calibration of long-term stream incision laws. The calibrated laws provide a quantitative basis for topographically derived estimates of strain patterns in inaccessible or poorly constrained areas of the belt such as the Alishan Range.

The presence of fresh volcanic<br/>ash more than 350 km from any volcano that is consistently discovered in<br/>pottery fragments (sherds) from the limestone Maya lowlands is unexpected. Yet,<br/>since the 1930s, when Anna O. Sheppard identified volcanic ash in Maya pottery,<br/>archaeologists have been aware of the anomaly.

Examination will include <br/>1) monitoring the effects of firing on the composition of the glass shards in<br/>the pottery sherds; <br/>2) assessment of the elements (major, minor, and trace) and isotopic ratios<br/>(strontium and lead) of glass shards in pottery fragments for fingerprinting<br/>volcanoes; <br/>3) matching the elemental composition of glass shards and associated minerals in<br/>pottery sherds to candidate volcanoes in the Central American Highlands and<br/>Mexican Volcanic Belt;<br/> 4) simulating patterns of ashfall dispersal to the limestone lowlands for<br/>candidate volcanoes; and <br/>5) exploring the consequences of volcanic ashfall into the Maya lowland soil,<br/>plant, and animal life. <br/>These data will permit the team to address the implications of volcanic ash on<br/>the cultural development of the Maya and on refining lowland Maya chronology.<br/><br/>While it has been generally accepted that volcanic ash was of non-local origin,<br/>the anomaly of the presence of pristine, fresh volcanic ash has never been<br/>explained. Since the best answer is volcanic ashfall from distant volcanoes, the<br/>solution to the problem requires knowledge of both archaeology and volcanology.<br/> The intellectual merit of this collaboration is that it brings knowledge<br/>generated from NSF funding in distinct fields to a joint solution. The<br/>archaeological implications of the volcanological solution has consequences for<br/>understanding the economy of ceramic production as well as the ecology of the<br/>Maya forest where volcanoes are at a distance.<br/><br/>The broad impacts of the research results promote an innovative approach to<br/>problem-oriented science requiring the full involvement of distinct fields.<br/>Volcanoes are universally recognized as hazards, but at a distance they can<br/>provide benefits such as temper for pottery and amendments for soil. Thus, the<br/>resolution of this archaeological issue will expand our understanding of<br/>society's interaction with their changing environment.

Frohman<br/><br/>The principal investigator will extend and interpret quantum<br/>invariants of three-manifolds utilizing the geometry of character<br/>varieties. The ideas he is exploring will combine tools from<br/>gauge theory, representation theory, homological algebra, and<br/>three-manifold topology. This entails work on several<br/>problems. With Kania-Bartoszynksa he will define a quantum<br/>invariant of three-manifolds which will be a real analytic<br/>function on the open interval (-1,1). The invariant will be<br/>obtained by heat kernel regularization of the divergent formula<br/>for the Turaev-Viro invariant. The power series expansion at 0,<br/>will be in terms of weighted signed counts of surfaces carried by<br/>a spine of the manifold. The normalized limit as you approach 1,<br/>will yield the total Reidemeister torsion of the SU(2)-character<br/>variety of the fundamental group of the manifold. Using ideas<br/>from matrix models he will develop an analogous invariant based<br/>on the SL(2,C)-character variety of the three-manifold. With his<br/>students he will continue to study the connection between the<br/>A-polynomial and quantum invariants, and explore the knot and<br/>link homology theories of Khovanov and Khovanov-Rozansky. With<br/>Oliver Dasbach and Marta Asaeda he is looking at homology<br/>theories underlying the Alexander polynomial. Finally, given a<br/>three-manifold and a Heegaard splitting there is an algebra which<br/>is the Kauffman bracket skein module of the Heegaard surface and<br/>a bimodule over that algebra built from the skein modules of the<br/>two handle-bodies. With Mike McLendon, he will study whether this<br/>homology is a three-manifold invariant, and if it is, what its<br/>relation to Khovanov homology is.<br/><br/>The rational understanding of the path integrals of Richard<br/>Feynman stand as one of the major unresolved problems of<br/>mathematics. Using his integrals Feynman was able to make<br/>computations in quantum electrodynamics that far exceeded<br/>previous work. The tools he developed allowed the construction of<br/>modern integrated circuits. The rules that physicists use for<br/>computing path integrals have never been made completely<br/>rigorous. The major thrust of Frohman's work in recent years has<br/>been about these integrals in a simplified setting where things<br/>can actually be computed. Specifically, the Yang-Mills measure in<br/>the Kauffman bracket skein module assigns to a gauge field on the<br/>space of flat connections on a surface a number. The formula for<br/>the measure coincides with an asymptotic expansion that appears<br/>throughout the physical literature. However, in this situation it<br/>is actually a convergent series. Frohman is using this formula,<br/>and the estimates he used to prove it converged, to pursue the<br/>analytic study of three-manifold invariants that were before only<br/>computable using algebraic and combinatorial methods. The goal of<br/>the project is to reveal the geometric and toplogical nature of<br/>quantum invariants of three-manifolds to the end of increasing<br/>the understanding of three-manifolds, representation theory and<br/>quantum gravity.
0514583	Dissertation Research: The Socialization of Adult Welsh Language Learners	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY	09/01/2005	07/13/2005	John Bowen	MO	Washington University	Standard Grant	Deborah Winslow	08/31/2007	$11,000.00		jbowen@artsci.wustl.edu	CAMPUS BOX 1054	Saint Louis	MO	631304862	3147474134	SBE	1390	9179, SMET	$0.00	Within the past 15 years the status of the Welsh language in Wales has changed dramatically: where Welsh was once banned from public use, it now shares co-official-language status with English. Where Welsh speakers recently faced discrimination, they are now sought out for positions in high-prestige fields such as the government and media. In the wake of these changes, a record number of people are choosing to learn the language. This dissertation research by a cultural anthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis explores the socialization of adult Welsh language learners in Cardiff, Wales. Using field techniques that include participant observation, media reception studies, and extensive interviews, the project addresses how these learners deal with often conflicting normative signals during their socialization as 'legitimate' or 'authentic' Welsh speakers. These signals include both explicit and symbolic commentary on aspects of the Welsh language in the media, and cues from language instructors and native speakers in interaction. Research objectives include documenting macro- and micro-level normative signals aimed at learners; exploring how these signals inform learners' language attitudes, behaviors, and definitions of what a Welsh speaker is; and understanding the extent to which the 'Welsh learner' label amounts to a new category of social identification. This research will contribute to cultural and linguistic anthropology by bridging macro- and micro-level factors behind new ideologies and social categories. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: Welsh represents a rare potential example of successful language revitalization. Members of other endangered-language communities, such as the Maori, Irish, Basque, and Cornish, pay close attention to developments in Welsh language policy and education. Research into the experiences of Welsh language learners will therefore provide valuable insights to groups attempting to preserve their native languages. In addition the project advances the education of a young social scientist.

Due to major erosion of the Point Barrow coastal beach, a number of prehistoric burials have been exposed. The recent decision by the Ukpeag'vik Inupiat Corporation to remove and relocate the burials and to allow scientific examination of the burials has provided an unprecedented opportunity for gathering scientific information on the skeletal material from these burials. Working with the permission of local authorities, the scientific team will examine the material. In addition, the researchers plan to work with local high school students and provide them training and experience in archaeological techniques and skeletal recovery. The information gathered and analyzed as a result of the project should give new insights into the long debate on the origins of the Thule people and their relationship to Barrow populations.

It is also proposed to extend the current methodology and prepare for the first time three types of membranes with the three main pore orientations (straight, zig-zag, tortuous) of the MFI structure perpendicular to the film surface and examine their microstructure and separation performance. The level of microstructural control that will be demonstrated will bring practical zeolite polycrystalline thin films as close they can be to single crystals. The microstructure will be characterized and separation performance will be measured. In addition to their practical significance (identifying high performance microstructures), the proposed experiments are of fundamental significance because they will provide the first set of gas and vapor permeation data through zeolite membranes of a given structure type with drastically different preferred orientations. Such a data set is expected to be valuable in providing a connection between microstructure and membrane performance and to guide further developments in the field of inorganic membranes. The proposed research will have broader impacts on the worldwide effort for developing energy efficient separation technologies. High quality film growth on commercial, high-flux, stainless steel supports is a necessary step towards scale up and to make our membranes available to the separations and reaction engineering communities. Moreover, the engineering issues that will be addressed with respect to oriented assembly of inorganic nanoparticles on surfaces and control of templated crystal growth are central for the fabrication of functional nanostructures. Consequently, an entire range of new technologies at the nanoscale, ranging from sensors to catalysts with controlled porosity and nanostructure may be affected by the findings of the current effort. The research program has an educational component including involvement of undergraduate students in the research and a well-defined outreach effort. This project may stimulate the development of new separation processes and catalytic membrane reactors.
0541733	Evolutionary convergence and parallelism in zebrafish pigment pattern development	IOS	EVOLUTION OF DEVELOP MECHANISM, DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY CLUSTER	06/15/2005	03/29/2010	David Parichy	WA	University of Washington	Continuing grant	Steven L. Klein	03/31/2011	$800,000.00		dparichy@uw.edu	4333 Brooklyn Ave NE	Seattle	WA	981950001	2065434043	BIO	1080, 7471	1080, 1111, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	Parichy <br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/><br/>We know very little about the developmental genetic mechanisms underlying adult form and the differences in adult form among species. Nevertheless, identification of the genes and cell behaviors responsible for adult morphology will be essential for a fuller understanding of diversity and evolution. These studies will investigate the development and evolution of adult form using as a model pigment patterns of fishes in the genus Danio. Pigment patterns are especially interesting because of their ecological and behavioral significance, and especially tractable because many genetic and cellular mechanisms for pigment pattern formation have been identified in the zebrafish, D. rerio. Moreover, close relatives of the zebrafish exhibit a diverse array of pigment patterns that can be investigated using many of the same methods employed in studies of the zebrafish itself. Thus, analyses of pigment patterns offer the prospect of truly integrative studies spanning multiple levels of organization, from genes to cells, and from individuals to populations and species. The proposed studies will investigate an important question in evolutionary developmental biology; namely, whenand how are genetic changes translated into morphological differences between species?<br/>First, mechanisms underlying the evolutionary loss of a striped pigment pattern will be examined in D. albolineatus. Genetic analyses identified a receptor tyrosine kinase, Fms, as a likely contributor to the difference between D. rerio (stripes) and D. albolineatus (no stripes). To test this possibility directly, interspecific differences in Fms expression and activity will be assayed and fms sequences will be examined for evidence of natural selection on this locus. This work will advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying evolutionary changes in morphology, and will serve as a model for integrative analyses of biological variation.<br/><br/>Second, stripe development in D. kyathit and D. shanensis will be examined to test whether the same mechanisms underlie stripe formation in these species as in D. rerio. Previous studies revealed that horizontal stripes in D. rerio depend on interactions between two classes of pigment cells. Such interactions may explain a diverse array of pigment patterns in vertebrates. This will be tested by investigating different modes of horizontal stripe development in D. kyathit and vertical stripe development in D. shanensis, using imaging, molecular marker analyses, and genetics. These studies will determine how conserved developmental mechanisms can be used to generate differences in trait expression across species, and will provide insights into pigment pattern evolution across a wide range of ectothermic vertebrates.<br/><br/><br/>Third, different mechanisms underlying superficially similar stripes in D. rerio and D. nigrofasciatus will be elucidated. Adult stripes in D. rerio and other species arise from stem cells at metamorphosis. Adult stripes in D. nigrofasciatus resemble those of D. rerio, yet develop largely from melanophores that differentiated at earlier stages, with little contribution from stem cells. Molecular analyses and cell transplantation experiments will elucidate how the stem cell lineage has changed in D. nigrofasciatus, and how early melanophore behaviors have been affected. These experiments will indicate the extent to which developmental mechanisms can evolve in the absence of corresponding changes in morphology, and will simultaneously address an important but understudied problem, the role of postembryonic stem cells in<br/>vertebrate development and evolution.<br/><br/>The proposed studies will have significant broader impacts by involving undergraduates and minority students, and by providing an example of integrative research spanning molecular and organismal biology. The location of the proposed studies (University of Texas) has a high proportion of minority students, and the PI has an excellent track record of involving undergraduates in laboratory research. In addition, one of the senior personnel is female, has excellent training in organismal biology and chemistry, and already serves as an outstanding role model for female undergraduate and graduate students. Finally, the PI is a member of two departments and attracts students with interests in behavior, ecology, evolution, genetics, and developmental<br/>biology, thus providing an unusually high degree of synergism in the laboratory environment.

Foremost, the PI will<br/>continue his study of random matrices with no symmetry, establishing<br/>fluctuation results for linear spectral statistics, limit theorems for the<br/>spectral edge, and further investigating the connections between these<br/>ensembles and roots of random polynomials. In the realm of Hermitian<br/>random matrices, the PI will employ the Riemann-Hilbert Problem method to<br/>investigate the behavior of the Janossy densities for large dimensional<br/>'Unitary Ensembles'. The goal is to then use these results to establish<br/>the speed of convergence of the largest eigenvalue distribution to its<br/>limiting Tracy-Widom distribution. Finally, the PI will generalize his<br/>recent results on the distribution of the ground state eigenvalue of a<br/>one-dimensional periodic Schroedinger operator with White Noise potential<br/>to a broader class of random potentials.<br/><br/>The random matrix models under study in this proposal have important<br/>applications to such disparate areas as multivariate statistics (principal<br/>component analysis), theoretical physics (energy levels and resonances of<br/>quantum systems) and electrical engineering (signal processing and<br/>wireless communication). Schroedinger operators with random potential on<br/>the other hand have long been studied as fundmental models in disordered<br/>solids. The PI brings to bear a variety of techniques from Probability<br/>and Analysis to study the detailed behavior of basic classes of random<br/>matrices and random Schroedinger operators in physically relevant limiting<br/>regimes. An overall goal of this proposal is to uncover new<br/>commonalities, or universal properties, of these models through asymptotic<br/>analysis.
0515252	Collaborative Research: Foundations of Coarsely Quantized Overcomplete Signal Expansions	CCF	SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM	08/01/2005	07/26/2005	Truong-Thao Nguyen	NY	CUNY City College	Standard Grant	John Cozzens	07/31/2009	$157,671.00		thao@ee.ccny.cuny.edu	Convent Ave at 138th St	New York	NY	100319101	2126505418	CSE	4720	9218, HPCC	$0.00	Digital signal processing has been one of the technological revolutions of highest impact. At the core, this technology relies fundamentally on approximating analog signals of the real world by discrete representations that can be stored, transmitted and processed without loss of information by digital circuits and computers. Despite the ubiquity of applications and products that process signals digitally, the interface between the analog and the digital worlds, i.e. the quantization paradigm, is still only partially understood from a fundamental point of view. While the classical approach of high-resolution discretization of independent signal samples has remained dominant in the theory, the actual technology has evolved in a completely different direction in which highly correlated signal samples are quantized very coarsely using as few as 1 bit per sample. Everyday technological products such as CD players, cell phones and laser printers have employed this alternative approach very successfully for over a decade already, yet the current theoretical understanding of coarsely quantized overcomplete expansions is still highly underdeveloped. The goal of this project is to set forth the theoretical foundations of this subject with the motivations of better analyzing existing methods, introducing new designs and creating new potential applications by extending the concept to other areas of signal processing.<br/><br/>Two specific and related methods for coarse quantization of redundant (overcomplete) signal expansions are sigma-delta modulation for A/D conversion of audio signals and error-diffusion for digital halftoning of images. In both cases, a given target analog signal is represented by a judiciously chosen one-bit (or few-bit) sequence which approximates the signal in a suitable low-pass subspace. Both methods employ specially designed nonlinear feedback dynamical systems to generate these representations, exact analyses of which are very challenging. Central questions of input-output error signal analysis -- a somewhat alien subject to dynamical systems -- have been traditionally addressed via empirical linear modeling. This research introduces radically new tools of analysis and design by incorporating dynamical systems and signal processing methods through a genuine study of the nonlinearity. A secondary contribution is the development of new signal processing applications in communications theory inspired by coarse quantization ideas in redundant systems.

In the past 10 years, over 30 research groups, from within the U of M, other universities and industry have used the current ion implanter. This research has resulted in dozens of publications, some of which are referenced in the project description. Over 40 graduate students have used the implanter for a significant portion of their thesis research. The new implanter will be an essential part of 14 research programs across campus, especially in the areas of 1) nanoparticle formation in metals and ceramics, 2) semiconductor nanostructures and heterostructures, 3) atomic and molecular structure modification, and 4) biomedical device materials. It will also play the lead role in providing surface modification capability to users of the NSF National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) through the Michigan node. This instrument will support research programs of 28 faculty spanning 9 departments across the University (Materials Science & Engineering, Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, and Geological Sciences), 5 other universities (Michigan State University, Wayne State University, Ohio State, U. Arkansas, University of Cork) and involving 55 graduate students, undergraduate students and post-docs, not including participation from NNIN. The programs outlined in the proposal narrative are some of the principal research programs at UM relying on ion implantation at MIBL. <br/><br/><br/>Ion implantation is a technique of using a beam of charged atoms (ions) to introduce a new atomic type into a material. This method is widely used in the semiconductor industry, where it is a fundamental tool in fabricating all modern electronic devices. The new implanter funded in this proposal will allow researchers in nine different departments to introduce students to research using this instrument. We are replacing an earlier instrument that has been operational for years, and very productive, but which is now obsolete. Dozens of students have been trained with the earlier instrument and a very broad set of research programs started. We will extend that work to an even wider audience, including collaborations with 5 other universities, and have research programs underway that involve 55 graduate, undergraduate and postdoctoral students. The new implanter will be used in several educational programs specifically aimed at undergraduate and high schools students trhough the NASA Summer High School Apprenticeship Program (SHARP).

The active radio sounding of the RPI provides local plasma resonances and remotely reflected signals (echoes) that can be used to derive plasma densities in-situ at satellite locations, and remotely and instantaneously the density distributions along the magnetic field lines down to the altitude as low as approximately 3000 km. The RPI database has accumulated about one million measurements covering all local times from about 3000 km to 4 Re altitude under different geomagnetic activities and the database is still growing. This makes it possible to develop empirical density models as function of radial distance, latitude, local time, season, solar wind/interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions, and geomagnetic activity indices. The RPI empirical models will be compared with topside density profiles from the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). The statistical and event observations, as well as numerical simulations, will be utilized to provide insights to the plasma dynamics both for the average density distributions and actual events.

It ranges from 0-2000 m elevation and includes all three of the major tropical terrestrial ecosystems other than desert and paramo. The caterpillars are found and reared by a team of 19 experienced Costa Rican parataxonomists with training and guidance by the PI. The resulting data - tens of thousands of images and their associated natural history - is both published and available on the project public web site http://janzen.sas.upenn.edu.<br/><br/>The information gathered is a) the base of a global pilot project demonstrating tropical conservation through non-damaging biodiversity development by local society, b) the provision of the natural history and trophic relationships of 4% of the world's butterfly and moth biodiversity via the internet, and c) major stimulus and data for the new initiative to DNA barcode the world's species for easy identification by anyone anywhere anytime, fast, leading to a massive increase in global bioliteracy.

A better understanding of such ecosystem processes could enable the development of a framework for predicting such things as the impact of the extinction of a species or environmental change on community structure. Communities in which species nest in tree cavities are often highly structured systems, as many cavity-nesters depend on other species to create the cavities they use. Cavity-nesting vertebrates comprise a major component of many forest communities and thus could be good model systems for better understanding ecological processes, species interactions and resulting community structure. This study examines two ecological processes, cavity creation and cavity enlargement, and the role they play in structuring the longleaf pine cavity-nesting bird community, in which the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker creates cavities used by 27 other species. This study will examine the impacts of red-cockaded woodpecker cavity creation and enlargement on the abundance of other avian cavity-nesters using four years of field data, experimental manipulation of cavity availability and statistical modeling. Study results will contribute to theoretical ecology, as well as conservation biology by examining the potential impacts of widely used endangered species management techniques on a suite of non-targeted community members. This study will support the dissertation research of a doctoral candidate, and also contains a strong training component by providing field experience for recent college graduates planning to attend graduate school.

The infrastructure is a hybrid partly Windows- and partly Unix-based system, designed to acquire, analyze, integrate, securely store, and visualize large volumes of multimodal/multisensor data obtained from an experimental subject, all in real time. The data are generated locally by sensing systems that currently exist in the laboratories, and include thermal cameras, 3D stereo video cameras, and brain activity scanners. Capable of integrating data collected at remote collaborating institutions, the system may include MRI and CT scans or live neurophysiological activity. The facility compliments the systems already available where the existing high-performance computers, primarily devoted to number crunching, are intended to run for a long time without interruption. Currently, these researchers have separate labs, each specializing in a different image modality. The proposal seeks to unify these labs, extend the range of modalities, and add computational and visualization resources. Relying on an interdisciplinary team of experts to integrate the best existing tools and practice of information technology, and to develop software tools specific to the common needs of real-world biomedical applications, the project addresses the needs of the ever-increasing complexity of biomedical data collection, and analysis and distribution of digital information upon which computational biosciences are dependent today. The infrastructure supports ongoing projects in<br/>-Functional imaging (computational tracking of human learning),<br/>-Thermal and Optical Imaging, and<br/>-Distributed computing.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This work should significantly advance the state-of-the-art in computational biomedicine and bioengineering and should provide answers to complex problems currently under investigation. It may lead to new applications in the areas of human-computer interface and biometrics-based security.

Warchall	01/31/2009	$220,001.00		newton@usc.edu	University Park	Los Angeles	CA	900890001	2137407762	MPS	1266, 1271	0000, 9263, OTHR	$0.00	The project focuses on a wide range of N-vortex problems from dynamical systems theory, based on discrete vortex representations of the Euler equations of incompressible fluid mechanics. Emphasis will be placed on three topics: (1) The N-vortex problem on a rotating sphere with applications to atmospheric flows; (2) Analysis and data acquisition of global weather patterns; (3) N-body numerical algorithm development. Each is designed to develop new analytical and computational techniques in dynamical systems theory, test current techniques on models that are physically well grounded, develop new numerical algorithms that conserve quantities we know should be conserved, and push the models closer towards applications mostly in oceanographic and atmospheric sciences, but also in molecular modeling where some of the same underlying issues pertain (albeit with Hamiltonians of a different form). In many cases, techniques that have been developed for N-body problems in the celestial mechanics context will be exploited and adapted for use on this class of discrete vortex problems. Tools developed fall under the general category of high-performance computing in the context of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanical systems and the topics will be relevant in the development and formulation of global circulation models for the atmosphere and oceans. The data acquisition portion of the project focuses on the understanding of global weather patterns and the connection between these patterns and the transport and mixing of passive and active scalars such as environmental pollutants, oceanographic biota, and atmospheric ozone.
0510453	The Assembly of UHP Terranes: Was the Western Gneiss Region Built By Sequential or Repeated (Ultra)High-Pressure Events?	EAR	TECTONICS	07/01/2005	04/02/2007	Bradley Hacker	CA	University of California-Santa Barbara	Continuing grant	David Fountain	06/30/2009	$328,178.00	James Mattinson	hacker@geol.ucsb.edu	Office of Research	Santa Barbara	CA	931062050	8058934188	GEO	1572	0000	$0.00	Understanding the formation and exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure rocks continues to be one of the outstanding tectonic questions of our time because of the impact such processes have had on the exchange of material between the crust and mantle, the generation and collapse of mountain belts, the formation and processing of continental crust, and tectonic plate motions. A major step forward will be to understand how ultrahigh-pressure orogens are constructed: by subduction of continental margins, subduction of microcontinents, intracontinental subduction or another process?<br/><br/>This project tests whether ultrahigh-pressure orogens form through repeated subduction of the same tectonic unit or through sequential subduction of different units, by examining a specific example, the Western Gneiss Region of Norway. Following careful petrology, zircon genesis is assessed by optical and back-scattered electron petrography, cathodoluminescence, trace-element abundances, and Raman spectroscopy. Single grains and grain fragments are analyzed by thermal-ionization mass spectrometry, select populations by chemical abrasion thermal-ionization mass spectrometry, and inherited cores by laser-ablation multiple-collector inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry. Monazite genesis is determined by deconvolving the record of major- and trace-element zoning in silicate and phosphate minerals in different textural settings. Following reconnaissance secondary-ion mass spectrometry dating, single grains and grain fragments will be analyzed by thermal-ionization mass spectrometry.<br/><br/>The strength of this approach lies in its use of state-of-the-art zircon and monazite geochronology and petrology, collaboration with researchers at cutting-edge facilities, and our familiarity with other ultrahigh-pressure orogens. The impact of this research should be considerable and broadly applicable because of the archetypal nature of the Norwegian ultrahigh-pressure terrane.

This has led to considerable interest in analyzing reduced biological models of neuronal networks. Most analytical studies of these network models assume that the system is spatially homogeneous. Recently, however, the principal investigator has shown that the combined effect of a spatially localized inhomogeneous input and recurrent synaptic interactions between neurons can result in nontrivial forms of coherent oscillations and waves. This motivates the current research project, which will carry out a more detailed study of the cellular and network mechanisms underlying the generation of these oscillations and waves. The research program will be divided into three parts corresponding to three distinct neurobiological application areas: (I) epileptiform activity in a model of disinhibited neural tissue, (II) stimulus-induced coherent oscillations in a model of primary visual cortex, and (III) localized activity states in a two-layer thalamic network model of the head direction system. In each of these cases the existence and stability of coherent activity states will be analyzed, and their dependence on various biologically relevant parameters will be determined. The mathematical aspects of the work will also be applicable to other population-based biological systems, in which the basic elements at the molecular, cellular or organismal level interact nonlocally in space.<br/><br/>Analysis of the dynamical mechanisms underlying spatially structured activity states in neural tissue is crucially important for understanding a wide range of neurobiological phenomena, both naturally occurring and pathological. For example, neurological disorders such as epilepsy and migraine are characterized by waves propagating across the surface of the brain. Determining the various cellular and network properties underlying the onset of such disorders could ultimately help in developing clinical techniques for eliminating them. Spatially coherent activity states are also prevalent during the normal healthy functioning of the brain, encoding local properties of visual and auditory stimuli, encoding head direction and spatial location, and maintaining persistent activity states in short-term working memory.

The attributes of this methodology are the ability to control molecular weight, to prepare functionalized polymethylene derivatives and novel architectures and polymethylene copolymers. Because of the importance of the closely related polyethylene, these functional materials have potential value as compatibilizers, blending agents and surface modifiers.<br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kenneth J. Shea of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine. Professor Shea will focus his work on the development of new polymerization reactions for the preparation of substituted carbon backbone polymers. The development of new catalysts for these reactions will contribute to the mechanistic understanding of carbon-carbon forming reactions and can benefit both polymer and small molecule synthesis. The research is also an excellent arena for the training of graduate students.

Research on material behavior shows that at temperatures near -20 degrees C concrete properties are altered by 20 to 50 percent, ductility of steel may be completely lost, and soil properties are enhanced by up to two orders of magnitudes. Consequently, the lateral load response of structures, which is dictated by soil-foundation-structure interaction and the ductility capacity of structural members, is dependent on environmental conditions. With the potential for large seismic events in various states that experience seasonal freezing, an investigation of the temperature effects on the lateral load response of soil-foundation-structure systems becomes of paramount importance.<br/><br/>This project explores temperature effects on soil-foundation-structure systems by studying bridge <br/>Columns supported on cast-in-drilled-hole (CIDH) pile shafts. Through a large-scale outdoor <br/>Experimentation, lateral load responses of three bridge columns in warm and frozen ground conditions will be studied to understand the seasonal temperature effects on soil-structure interaction as well as system ductility. A preliminary analytical investigation revealed that freezing conditions at a ground temperature near -20 degrees C may reduce structure displacement capacity by 70% and increase column shear demand by 35%, due to relocation and reduction in spread of plasticity in the pile shaft. An analytical study utilizing the measured material properties and in-situ soil test data will be performed to characterize the responses of the three bridge column systems. Comparing the analytical and experimental results, seismic design implications of the effects of seasonal freezing on soil-foundation-structure systems will be presented. In addition, a plan for detailed investigation on this subject area will be developed. <br/><br/>The results of the proposed exploratory study are expected to improve design of soil-foundation-structure systems under extreme lateral loads such as those induced by earthquakes, thus contributing to construction of safer, more reliable structures in regions that experience seasonal freezing.

In manganites, for example, atomic-scale couplings lead to a multitude of phases involving spin, charge, and orbital ordering on a scale of 1-2 nm. Near phase boundaries, where the free energy difference between these phases is small, mesoscopic phase separation is often observed, leading to disordered phase heterogeneity on a scale of 10 - 1000 nm. Finally, the dynamical response of these mesoscopic structures is thought to play a key role in complex macroscopic properties like colossal magnetoresistance. We are particularly interested in probing the expected anomalous dynamics endemic to disordered mesoscale systems, and in relating our results to existing transport and thermodynamic measurements. Specific planned experiments include measurement of fluctuations in charge-, spin-, and orbital-ordered phases, and measurement of coupled polaronic fluctuations near the Curie temperature as a function of alloy composition. <br/><br/>Non-technical abstract:<br/><br/>Doped transition metal oxide compounds offer excellent examples of how complex hierarchical interactions can lead to interesting and useful material properties. In manganites, for example, atomic-scale interactions lead to many phases with varying magnetic and structural orderings on the scale of a few nanometers. Near phase boundaries, where the energy difference between these phases is small, mesoscopic phase separation is often observed, leading to disordered phase heterogeneity on a scale of 10 - 1000 nm. Finally, the dynamical response of these mesoscopic structures is thought to play a key role in complex macroscopic properties like colossal magnetoresistance. The work supported by this individual investigator proposal will probe the most poorly understood part of this hierarchy - the way in which complexity emerges from ordered microscopic phases into poorly ordered mesoscopic structures. Coherent soft x-ray beams will be applied to do accomplish this understanding using the x-ray analog of dynamic laser light scattering, a technique often used to study materials at longer length scales.

To improve our ability to predict the dynamics of carbon in high latitudes, this team analyze comprehensively the carbon cycle of the arctic system, guided by the following general questions: What are the geographic patterns of fluxes of CO2 and CH4 over the Pan-Arctic region and how is the balance changing over time and What processes control the sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4 over the Pan-Arctic region and how do the controls change with time?<br/><br/>To address these general questions, the group will integrate data on CO2 and CH4 dynamics of the Arctic System using a combination of prognostic and inverse approaches and provide an integrative approach to estimating and understanding the exchanges of CO2 and CH4 from terrestrial and marine components of the system.<br/><br/>Because the climate system is vulnerable to significant releases of CO2 and CH4 from high latitudes, the responses of these gases to climate change have global consequences. This study will bring together diverse regional data sets and understanding in the context of a linked set of numerical model studies. It will examine, and attempt to quantify, the fluxes and links between the terrestrial, atmospheric and oceanic components of the Arctic carbon and methane cycles.

First of all, in a randomized algorithm the outcomes of random events are used to determine the progress of the algorithm. Randomization is now a standard tool of the computer scientist. A second area of consideration is when the problem instances come from some probability distribution and one wants to understand the average performance of a particular algorithm, which is often far better than its worst case. Both aspects are extremely important and this proposal describes a number of problems in these two areas.<br/>Broader Impact<br/>Results from this work will be disseminated at scientic workshops and at seminars at other institutions, both nationally and internationally. Results obtained will be published in journals and conference proceedings. The P.I. takes care to ensure that all of his recent papers are available on-line on his home-page. Work on Monte-Carlo Markov Chain analysis has an impact on Probability Theory and Sta- tistical Physics. In addition the proposal will have an impact on education, mainly at the graduate level. The PI tries to embed the knowledge gained from his research into courses and tries to involve his graduate students (currently four of them) as much as possible in any research that he does. Sometimes the work involved is of such a nature that it can lead to meaningful summer projects for bright undergraduates. In such cases the P.I. has sought and will seek additional support from the NSF and Carnegie Mellon University. In the recent past the P.I. has supervised such projects on Small-World networks, on Resource Discovery in Distributed Networks, on a<br/>Directed Model of Web-Graphs and on a Graph Version of Nim. In addition, the P.I. is actively involved in the NSF funded Aladdin project in the Computer Science Department at CMU and this has a signicant out-reach component.

This process provides a source of nitrogen that is environmentally and economically advantageous since it minimizes pollution from the release of excess nitrogen (e.g. nitrates in runoff) and does not require the use of expensive chemical fertilizers. Nitrogen fixation in plants is an energy-intensive, aerobic process that requires substantial amounts of oxygen. This oxygen consumption leads to a fundamental dilemma since the environment within nodules promotes the formation of damaging, activated forms of oxygen such as hydrogen peroxide. Consequently, nodules contain high levels of antioxidants such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and numerous enzymes such as ascorbate peroxidase. Recent observations in this laboratory have revealed that soybean nodules also contain glutathione S-transferase (GST). This enzyme is best known for its role in detoxification of herbicides, but it is also capable of serving as an antioxidant. The objectives of this project are to define the role that GST plays in nitrogen-fixing legume nodules. Molecular techniques will be used to determine which forms of the GST gene family are expressed in nodules and what conditions stimulate the production of GST. Microscopic examination of nodule sections treated with fluorescent antibodies will be used to determine precisely where GTS is located. Nodulated plants will be exposed to various regimes involving chemical pro-oxidants to develop a model system to evaluate oxidative stress and to aid in identifying additional novel antioxidant proteins. The function of critical GST genes will be examined in transgenic plants in which the genes are down regulated. The discovery of GST in nodules is significant because it represents a potentially major overlooked aspect of oxygen relations in nodules. Since nitrogen fixation is likely limited by oxygen, any increase in the fundamental knowledge of antioxidants in nodules could have substantial impacts on future attempts to enhance performance of nitrogen-fixing crops. Furthermore, a confirmation of the antioxidant role of GST in nodules will lend credence to a similar role in other systems (including animals and microbes) where GST is present. This project fulfills NSF broader impact criteria by providing valuable preparation of undergraduate students, most of who are destined for graduate studies in plant biology. Students will be encouraged to attend meetings and to remain as a research technician and mentor for a few months following their graduation. Undergraduates engaged in senior thesis or summer projects will conduct the bulk of the research. Over the past 15 years, the P.I. has worked with 66 senior thesis research students and 47 summer research fellows; 35 of the thesis students were women. This grant will also provide summer research opportunities for high school students by establishing collaboration with the Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering (ASE) Program (http://www.saturdayacademy.pdx.edu/ase/). ASE helps students explore their interests and make informed educational and career decisions.

A key feature associated with the evolution of the land plant body plan was the origin of three dimensional tissue patterning derived from a shoot apical meristem, with the capacity for branching, production of leaves and flowers, and the origin of roots. The aims of the proposed research are to characterize the Class III HD-Zip and KANADI gene families in plants representing all land plant lineages and the algal sister group. These gene families were chosen because of their pivotal roles in Arabidopsis in the SAM function, patterning of tissues in stem, leaf, and root, and vascular differentiation, which represent the key innovations of land plant body plan evolution. Since members of both gene families function as a single genetic program in each of the tissues where they act in Arabidopsis, investigation of the evolution of gene expression and function in a broad phylogenetic sample of plants has the potential to yield evidence of how this genetic program has been co-opted to pattern new morphological structures. Such knowledge may be applied to manipulate plant architecture for agricultural or forestry purposes. This research will involve several undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds who will either continue their education in various graduate programs or go on to jobs in the biotech industry. In addition, the proposed research will provide undergraduate and graduate training in evolutionary developmental biology.

Combining the high computational performance of specialized circuits with the re-programmability of software, these devices are quickly becoming ubiquitous. Unfortunately, if unprotected, this reconfigurability could be exploited to disrupt critical operations, snoop on supposedly secure channels, or even to physically melt a device. However, a new approach to controlling changes to the hardware logic promises to overcome these problems. In addition, the innate malleability of this hardware presents the opportunity for hardware enforcement of adaptive security policies. For example, in an emergency, trusted individuals may need to override the nominal security policy. Thus, the reconfigurable component may provide a highly trusted mechanism for secure functionality in changing environments.<br/><br/>This research aims to close a gaping security hole in our nation's information infrastructure by enhancing the logical structure and internal management of reconfigurable hardware to enforce a dynamic information protection policy. Specifically, this research will: (1) discover hardware synthesis and static validation methods that will ensure that only secure and non-destructive configurations can be loaded, (2) develop new reconfigurable structures capable of securely mediating run-time access to shared resources through the use of hardware-compiled formal access policy languages, and (3) establish a firm foundation for trustworthy dynamic policy enforcement through ontological analysis, formal modeling and the development of management mechanisms integrating the results of the first two activities.

The first is to improve the decomposition technique for analyzing convergence rates. Decomposition is a powerful tool for breaking a complicated chain into smaller pieces that are more amenable to analysis. Next, the proposal examines new sampling algorithms for contingency tables, or non-negative integral matrices that satisfy prescribed row and column sum constraints. We plan to explore the cell-bounded generalization where the entries in the matrices are further constrained to satisfy given upper bounds. These tables have applications in statistics, and the cell-bounded case includes well-studied computer science applications such as approximating the permanent and sampling bipartite graphs with given degree sequences. The second proposed direction is studying the behavior of protocols on ad hoc networks. Sampling graphs with known degree sequences is an important challenge in the context of the Internet and web graphs, where practitioners are trying to develop efficient protocols on graphs whose degrees satisfy conjectured power laws. An additional research focus will be to design power-efficient protocols for sensor networks that guarantee connectedness and efficient performance. The Adaptive Power Topology Control Algorithm is a local approach to building up networks in this context, but little is understood about the tradeoffs between the sparsity of the graphs and the optimization of power. Moreover, most of the analysis to date has been done only with the idealized assumption of the disk model for wireless<br/>footprints. The proposed research will explore these tradeoffs and more realistic footprint assumptions. Intellectual merit: Markov chain Monte Carlo remains a popular method in many disciplines for studying large combinatorial systems. Recent developments for analyzing their convergence rates have established the first rigorous, polynomial time algorithms for many fundamental sampling problems. There remain many opportunities for furthering this research, both by developing new methods for analyzing these chains and designing new algorithms to address particular applications. While convergence rates are well understood from a mathematical perspective, new methods for systematically deriving polynomial bounds on their running times are still required. Remaining challenges include developing new sampling algorithms for various applications and designing new tools to aid their analysis. This remains one of the foremost areas where theoretical computer science can impact other scientific disciplines because of the large amounts of computational resources currently be expended on nonrigorous sampling heuristics. Ad hoc networks are gaining prominence in the field of algorithms as the Internet and wireless devices become central tools. There is great opportunity for developing rigorous protocols that are robust under a wide set of operational assumptions.<br/>Broader impact: This research will be supplemented through an educational component. Starting in Fall 2005, the P.I. will be chairing the organizing committee of a DIMACS special focus on Discrete Random Systems, concentrating on this area of interdisciplinary research. In addition to the typical workshops bringing together leading researchers in the relevant areas, there will also be workshops promoting broader impact. One such workshop will provide an outreach to practitioners using clever heuristics in the hopes that collaborations will lead to the design of faster rigorous algorithms; another will focus on applications of Markov chains in other areas of computer science, including spectral methods used to study the Internet and web graphs.

Particular attention will be given to the distribution of crystalline water ice and ammonia hydrate on KBOs. Both species are expected to be short-lived in the presence of ionizing radiation and energetic particles, as are expected in the Kuiper Belt. The astronomical data will be used to drive a parallel program of laboratory work in which the effects of the space environment on the KBOs will be quantitatively examined. The specific goals are 1) to obtain a set of high quality near infrared <br/>spectra of KBOs and related objects to study the distribution of crystalline ice, ammonia hydrate and other volatile species and 2) to experimentally estimate the timescales for back-conversion of crystalline ice to amorphous ice and for the destruction of ammonia hydrate by energetic particles. The larger objective is to see if astronomically detectable species can be used to estimate the effective ages of the optically active surfaces of the KBOs. <br/><br/>This is an interdisciplinary study that will exploit both the world's largest telescopes and a state-of-the-art ultra-high vacuum chamber simulator to investigate the prevalence and stability of crystalline ice and ammonia hydrate in the outer solar system. The research team includes experts in both areas, and they hope to bridge the gap that sometimes divides the disciplines, with benefits for<br/>the education of the graduate student and postdoc populations in both Physics & Astronomy and Chemistry. Dr. Jewitt is active in public education in astronomy and physics through speaking to community and educator groups and through TV, radio, newspaper and popular magazine interviews and articles.

The LIT-IM-MS instrument will combine LIT technology, a periodic focusing ion-guide mobility drift cell, high-resolution orthogonal-TOFMS and multi-anode, micro-array ion detection, which can be used for rapid (microsec to millisec) post-ionization separation and mass analysis of ions formed by electrospray ionization or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, as well as small molecule ion sources. In adition, IM-MS structural studies can be performed on products of ion-molecule and ion-ion reactions, solvated species, ion clusters which are weakly bound, and species which are weakly interacting. <br/><br/>Although the primary focus of this project is instrument development, it will provide novel interdisciplinary training opportunities for postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students in modern, cutting-edge mass spectrometry techniques and allied research areas. The research builds upon existing collaborations between scientists at Texas A&M University, Ionwerks, Inc. in Houston, and scientists at AB/MDS-Sciex in Toronto.

The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.<br/><br/>This award will support a twenty-two-month research fellowship by Dr. David B. Field to work with Dr. Dimitri Gutierrez at Instituto del Mar del Peru in Callao, Peru, and Dr. Christina Ravel at the University of California, Santa Cruz.<br/><br/><br/>The tropical Pacific is a key component in the global climate system and has far reaching societal impacts. Paleoclimate records are needed to examine ocean variability beyond the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) timescale. Since different modes of variability have unique horizontal and vertical patterns, determining the mechanisms of change is possible through reconstructing changes in the vertical structure of the water column with planktonic and benthic foraminifera, as well as through comparison of records between different locations. Laminated sediments from the Peruvian shelf region are ideally suited to test hypotheses concerning the role of the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) and intermediate water circulation in decadal- to-centennial-scale variability, the ecosystem response to such ocean variability, and the effects of anthropogenic activity. This proposal outlines an international effort to develop paleoceanographic time series resolving decadal-scale changes over the last 1,000 years from laminated sediments off Peru. This effort will take place at IMARPE (Instituto del Mar del Peru) in Callao, Peru in direct collaboration with Dr. Dimitri Gutierrez and other scientists from Peru, Chile, France, and Mexico. In the period of time spent at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the PIs will investigate the sources of high frequency climate variability in the Eastern tropical Pacific. <br/><br/>Characterizing the natural modes of climate variability is essential to understanding climate and ecosystem processes, detecting anthropogenic influences, and identifying and predicting future changes and risks. The time series of this research will serve as important constraints on the role of the ETP in modifying ENSO, decadal-to-centennial climate variability, and 20th century warming. Understanding the mechanisms of change has policy implications for assessing the potential environmental and ecological risks and uncertainties associated with future natural and/or anthropogenic change.

The proposed mass spectrometer will be based on MonitorInstruments miniature mass analyzer (MMA) and oceanographic components developed by WHOI. Testing and trial deployments will be carried out by WHOI at its Deep Submergence Laboratory and Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory. The TETHYS instrument will be optimized for long-term measurement of low molecular weight dissolved biogenic, atmospheric, and noble gases as well as light hydrocarbon compounds up to 50 AMU. This instrument will have minimum limits of detection on the order of parts-per-billion and be capable of shallow water to full ocean depth deployment. It will utilize techniques currently under development at WHOI to enable automated re-calibration in-situ and will also include measures for anti-fouling, an essential consideration for long-term deployment. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The partnership between WHOI and Monitor offers the potential of developing a new class of in situ mass spectrometer that potentially has a wide range of basic science/research applications highly relevant to development and use of both shallow- and deep-water ocean observatories. The work proposed could result in a new, commercially viable sensor that has applications ranging from basic science to resource management.

Thus it can be and has recently been applied to describe phenomena that cannot be described by these two major stochastic processes. To enlarge the scope of application one needs to study the nonlinear functionals of fractional Brownian motion. An important and natural class of such functionals are those given by stochastic differential equations. In addition to studying self-intersection local time, the principal investigator proposes to study general stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion. The difficulty in such study is caused by the fact that the powerful Picard's iteration approach fails to work. The principal investigator proposes to combine fractional calculus, anticipative stochastic calculus, and the characteristic theory to investigate such equations.<br/><br/>To describe natural or social phenomena mathematically, people usually use Markov property (the future depends only on today although the whole history until today is known). This is a reasonable simplification, particularly if one considers the sophistication needed to deal with the entire past. However, it becomes more and more demanding to assimilate all the information available to better predict the future. Fractional Brownian motion is among the simplest statistical model that captures this long memory character. It has found many applications. To more adequately fit mathematical models to the phenomena under consideration, one should use fractional Brownian motion as building blocks to obtain more sophisticated random quantities. The principal investigator has focused on this statistical model for a number of years and has achieved significant success. This research will considerably further this progress and is expected to have impact on many other fields. Immediate applications are to be found in finance and bio-informatics.

In particular, work focuses on characterizing the physical processes of earthquake slip, and quantifying the specific fracture energy of rupture, which is defined as the energy consumed by the formation of the rupture surface and loss of frictional strength. Constraining the specific fracture energy is important to modeling the dynamics of earthquake rupture propagation. The research involves detailed field mapping, sampling, and optical and electron microscopy and microprobe study of several key surface exposures of the active San Andreas fault and exhumed faults of the San Andreas system to quantify particle size distributions and fracture surface area within the faults, particularly focusing on the nanoscale particles within the fault zones. The mechanisms of particle size reduction, healing and particle growth in seismic faults are being determined. The results contribute to developing synoptic models that describe the 3-D structure of seismogenic fault zones and attempt to relate structural/petrologic characteristics to the mechanical parameters important for earthquake rupture nucleation, propagation, and arrest. The project is contributing to broad research programs and initiatives of national interest, such as National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program, the Southern California Earthquake Center, and the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth. The scientific benefits of this work are maximized through coordination with other researchers in the broader scientific community. The research provides education-through-research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, and addresses the fundamental physics of earthquakes, which ultimately may contribute to reduction of earthquake hazards and improved mitigation.

This activity will develop a theoretical framework to build configurable and composable performance analysis models of individual building blocks of middleware and their composition. (2) Model-driven generative technologies for whole-system performance analysis, which will eliminate error-prone and tedious ad hoc development of DPSS systems architectures and processes. (3) Aspect-oriented variability resolution, which will develop novel aspect-oriented modeling tools that help modularize the variability incurred by the configurable middleware building blocks. These tools will then weave in these artifacts into the existing performance models to specialize the blocks and their composition.
0503997	ITR/PE:Digital Citizenship: Expanding Information Technology Literacy with a Service-Learning Approach	IIS	DIGITAL GOVERNMENT	10/01/2004	07/28/2005	Stuart Shulman	PA	University of Pittsburgh	Standard Grant	Lawrence Brandt	09/30/2005	$25,906.00		stu@polsci.umass.edu	University Club	Pittsburgh	PA	152132303	4126247400	CSE	1706	9216, HPCC, 1706	$0.00	This is a proposal for a grant to promote service-learning as a model for the dissemination of Information Technology Literacy (ITL). Service-learning promotes mutually beneficial partnerships between academic institutions and communities. One goal is to empower communities to identify ITL needs that students can fulfill as part of their education. This grant would enable two central Iowa universities--Drake and Iowa State--to reach out to communities in need of ITL training and to assess the efficacy of service-learning interventions. Citizens are increasingly expected to interface with government using IT (ex. firstgov.gov). A number of studies have identified unequal levels of ITL as a significant barrier to equity in citizenship. While access to the Internet steadily expands, the ability to take advantage of increasing access hinges on the level of ITL among citizens. Community members, particularly in certain more vulnerable groups, often lack basic skills and concepts required when navigating an expanding electronic interface with government. Whereas IT should make it easier for all citizens to conduct their routine business with the government, in fact, it appears to be widening the gap between the IT literate and those without basic navigational skills. The primary objective of this research project is to test the efficacy of service-learning programs that seek to universalize digital citizenship. Three related objectives are to:<br/><br/> Define Information Technology Literacy (ITL) using broad and systematic criteria.<br/> Develop, implement, and evaluate best practices for using service-learning in the dissemination of ITL.<br/> Test the hypothesis that service-learning lessens the digital divide.<br/><br/>The proposed methodology uses experimental and control groups representing varying<br/>degrees of urbanization. A service-learning ITL class and fieldwork laboratory will establish links between undergraduates and the experimental groups. Researchers, students, and the serviced communities will develop and refine taxonomy of ITL skills. Experimental groups will be exposed to the service-learning treatment. Structured citizen surveys and focus groups will be used to analyze the data on program impact. Statistical analysis of covariance at specific points and variance over time will be employed to lay the groundwork for a predictive causal model. Several additional outcomes are expected as a result of this research. First, the study will model a new pedagogical intervention that links research, education, and community involvement in an effort to lessen the digital divide. Second, it makes the recipients of service the focus of scholarship. Most studies in this area focus on outcomes for the students rather than the recipients. Third, it focuses attention on the important distinction between IT access and IT literacy. Fourth, it promotes interdisciplinary research and training, as well as collaboration between public and private institutions seeking to incorporate IT into the campus curricula. Finally, it promotes innovation in the political science and education disciplines with the potential for a far-reaching impact on the basic definition of citizenship.

It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.<br/><br/>The research and training plan is entitled Evolution of metal use in bacteria.  This research investigates the evolution of the metallome-- the inorganic elements used within organisms.  Variations of elemental selection in modern organisms can inform hypotheses about metallome evolution in response to changing environmental conditions over long periods of Earth's history.  The research focus is on the relationship between the first major rise in atmospheric oxygen ca. 2.3 billion years ago and the evolution of metal-containing proteins critical for oxygen-sensitive metabolism in bacteria, particularly the iron-containing proteins nitrogenase and superoxide dismutase.  <br/><br/>The training goals are to learn to conduct research at the intersection between biology and geology and effectively bridge these disciplines.<br/>

At <br/>high bit-rates, however, nonlinear and stochastic physical effects <br/>contribute to limit the overall system performance. The deterministic <br/>impairments are mainly due to the combination of nonlinearity and <br/>dispersion. The stochastic impairments occur due to amplifier noise <br/>(which induces amplitude, timing and phase fluctuations) as well as <br/>polarization-mode dispersion. All of these effects produce impairments <br/>which lead to unacceptable rates of transmission errors. However, <br/>the large scale and complexity of these systems, the variety of effects <br/>involved, and the extremely low bit-error-ratios required of these <br/>systems (which requires studying the occurrence of extremely rare <br/>events) all contribute to make the modeling of optical fiber <br/>communications a challenging task. Recent work has demonstrated that <br/>careful mathematical and computational modeling can be very effective <br/>in describing the behavior of realistic optical fiber transmission <br/>systems. This research project aims at evaluating the potential of <br/>new transmission formats and assessing how each of them is affected <br/>by the various transmission impairments. The methods that will be <br/>developed in this project are expected to make an impact on how <br/>these systems are modeled and designed. In addition, because <br/>new ultra-short pulse lasers share many similarities with <br/>dispersion-managed optical transmission systems, the mathematical <br/>techniques that will be developed as part of this research project <br/>will help researchers understand the behavior of these lasers and <br/>their fundamental limits.<br/><br/>The development of high-capacity optical fiber communications has <br/>been a major technological advance that enabled the widespread use <br/>of the internet and the world-wide-web which revolutionized our <br/>day-to-day interactions.

A key feature of this <br/>collaborative research project is the combined use of sophisticated <br/>mathematical and computational methods to model the behavior of <br/>realistic lightwave systems, with the aim of developing the accurate <br/>tools which are needed to efficiently study the behavior of optical<br/>fiber transmission systems and to design the next generation of <br/>systems. As such, the outcome of this project will contribute to <br/>strengthening the national infrastructure and maintaining U.S. <br/>competitiveness in an area which is of great national interest,<br/>thus benefiting not just researchers, but also the community at <br/>large.

For example, various types of endoscopes are used for colonoscopy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, enteroscopy, bronchoscopy, and cystoscopy. In addition, a rapidly expanding number of formerly open surgical procedures now are being converted to endoscopic procedures including resection of gallbladders, retrieval of donor kidneys, resection of tumors of colon and pancreas, correction of hiatal hernias, coronary artery bypass grafting and minimal invasive neurosurgeries. Despite a large body of knowledge in medical image analysis, endoscopy videos are not systematically captured for real-time or post-procedure reviews and analyses. They are recorded occasionally to magnetic video-tapes (i.e., VHS). No hardware and software tools have been developed to capture, analyze, and provide user-friendly and efficient access to the medical, scientific, or educational content on such videos. This project aims to develop an Endoscopic Multimedia Information System (EMIS) to capture high quality endoscopy videos, analyze the captured videos, and provide efficient access to the content of these videos.<br/><br/>Images of endoscopy videos significantly differ from medical still images as studied<br/>in the literature of medical image processing. The project will develop a new capturing system for endoscopy videos designed for patient's privacy and is non-disruptive to endoscopic procedures<br/>and non-restrictive to a particular endoscope vendor. New algorithms for automatic classification of informative and non-informative frames. The technique does not need any predefined parameters or thresholds. New algorithms for automatic content analysis for protruding lesions such aspolyps. Many protruding lesions are clustered together. A new region segmentation technique that can identify isolated lesions will be developed first. To handle clustered<br/>lesions, algorithms using a region pattern graph that captures important characteristics of relevant regions will be developed..<br/><br/>The proposed system will directly benefit endoscopic research, education, and training. Contributions to research-based training of graduate students who will contribute to research-based advanced training of students in graduate and undergraduate programs in computer science and medical informatics at PI and CoPI's institutions. The project will contribute to training of a new generation of computer scientists with a unique skill set supplement to traditional<br/>medical imaging. This research will enhance research opportunities for junior high and high school students participating in various university programs (UTA Summer Science Camp, Program for Women in Science and Engineering) and national programs.

Although much work has been done in this area, a great deal of effort has been put in simulation and experimental study. Some researchers proposed algorithms for sensor networks, but unfortunately many of them are based on the same assumptions as in traditional distributed computer systems including mobile ad-hoc networks. Sensor networks, however, are very different from the computing systems we have built before in terms of energy concerns, large scale, unreliable communication, etc. Thus, most of the algorithm design foundations are not suitable for sensor networks.<br/>We have two observations for a sensor network. First, a sensor network is composed of fragile nodes with limited computation capability, operated on limited battery power, and connected via lossy wireless networks. Therefore, due to the energy consumption of transmitting information to a single point, the imprecise knowledge of the network, and the dynamic status of the network, it is prohibitive to run centralized algorithms on a sensor network; instead, a localized algorithm is preferable. Second, since a sensor network consists of a large number of nodes, algorithm analysis is also different from that of traditional computer systems. Communication complexity is important because communication captures the energy consumption. In additon, analysis should not rely on the specific location of each node, but be based on the random distribution of the sensors. The random analysis, instead of the fixed graph structure, should be used for performance evaluation.<br/>Intellectual merit: We propose to address those theoretical challenges by examining the computational<br/>limitations and capabilities, algorithm design, and performance analysis for sensor networks based on localized diffusion-like operation and random analysis. Specifically, we look into three sensor network problems: clock synchronization, robot navigation and task assignment, and information diffusion in a mobile sensor network. The first problem is a classic topic for distributed systems, which has attracted much attention for the past several decades. By solving it, it can help us to understand the fundamental limitations and capabilities of a sensor network. The second application addresses one of the most important aspects of a sensor network: data dissemination. We design localized, fault-tolerant, and very simple algorithms for the above two problems. The third one estimates the speed for information diffusion in a random network, which is very important in analyzing the performance for a localized algorithm. The analysis techniques will benefit the algorithm design and analysis for other problems in sensor network applications and infrastructure design.<br/>We believe our effort is a first step toward understanding sensor networks, and exploring how to design and analyze algorithms for sensor networks. Much theoretical work has done on general networks, but most relies on the assumptions that are not appropriate for sensor networks. Localized and fault-tolerant algorithm design and analysis are very important and promising for the future prevalence of sensor network deployment. This research will help to solve and answer the fundamental problems and limits in sensor networks, for example, clock synchronization, data dissemination, information diffusion, and so on.<br/>Broader impact: The project will integrate research and education by introducing sensor network and more advanced algorithm design techniques to the students. It will help to supplement one undergraduate network course and design two graduate level courses. Results from the project will be disseminated via conferences, journals, and the Internet. Furthermore, this project will stimulate the collaboration with people from various disciplines, e.g., networking, computational geometry, online algorithm, matrix analysis, robotics, and so forth.

This is critical for the study of microelectromechanical systems, composites and complex oxides (ferroelectrics and piezoelectrics) as well as biomaterials. <br/><br/>Ferroelectrics are used in nanoelectromechanical systems as random access memories. Their actual implementation requires the capability to quantitatively probe properties of ferroelectrics at 10nm length scale. However, the lack of quantitative aspects of SPM techniques hinders development of the quantitative imaging of nanoscale electromechanical properties. To propel electromechanical SPMs and nano-indentation techniques to a quantitative characterization tool, the main challenge remains quantitative electromechanics of various tip-surface junctions - the piezoelectric contact mechanics. The investigators in their study are addressing these problems. These results are relevant at hierarchy of length scales, from the millimeter (biological tissues) to the nanometer (bio-applications at the level of cells).

These maps will be constructed using visible absorption lines of NaI and CaII seen in the spectra of ~ 2000 early-type stars located within +/-500pc of the Sun. Such maps will reveal the dimensions and nature of many types of nearby interstellar structures such as (i) local interstellar tunnels, (ii) local interstellar chimneys, (iii) conductive interfaces of nearby superbubbbles and (iv) Intermediate Velocity Cloud complexes in the inner galactic halo regions. These new absorption maps are necessary for understanding the details revealed in recent 21cm radio emission surveys of neutral hydrogen (HI), as well as for aiding in the interpretation of interstellar absorption studies carried out at other wavelengths. The data will provide accurate and important input parameters (such as the filling factor of the cold neutral gas) that can be used to test current theoretical models that attempt to describe the formation and possible evolution of the more global ISM.<br/><br/>This study builds on a preliminary map of the local ISM constructed to a distance of ~200pc that has already been widely used by other astronomers in a variety of case studies. The new mapping of a 1kpc interstellar data-cube will be the first to reveal the absorption characteristics of both neutral and partially ionized gas throughout these regions, and will highlight several expanding large-scale structures that may affect the overlying galactic halo through a possible 'galactic fountain blow-out..<br/><br/>This study will be undertaken as an integral part of graduate student training. The research is being performed as a collaborative effort between scientists at UC Berkeley and CNRS in France, and the major scientific findings will be disseminated to K-12 educators at the Center for Science Education at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory. Since interstellar cavities, tunnels and supernova remnants are to be found in many nearby galaxies, the very detailed spatial information gained from the present galactic study will provide a testable database against which observations of their extragalactic counterparts may be compared. Clearly if one can understand how such fundamental interstellar structures are formed and evolve locally, then this may have a significant impact on our understanding of the interstellar medium in other galaxies.

The qubits in the envisioned QIP are the two lowest orbital states of electrons bound to shallow donors (D0) in GaAs or bound in elongated self-assembled quantum dots called quantum dashes (QDAs). QDAs will be grown by molecular beam epitaxy on patterned substrates. The resonance frequency of D0 and QDA-based qubits will be between 1 and 4 Terahertz (THz). The energy relaxation and decoherence rates of these qubits will be measured, and are predicted to be slow because the resonant frequencies are well below that of an optical phonon. GaAs and Si Photonic crystal resonators for THz frequencies will also be fabricated and characterized. Finally, qubits will be incorporated into resonators and reversible coupling of energy between the resonator and qubits will be investigated. <br/><br/>This research program works at two scientific and technological frontiers: harnessing quantum mechanics for information processing, and developing the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between 1 and 10 THz (THz-1 THz=one trillion cycles/s). The research will explore a new approach to quantum information processing in semiconductors, enhance our fundamental understanding of the transfer of information and energy between simple quantum systems and their semiconducting hosts, and create new materials and structures in which to store THz light and control its interaction with matter.

The visit will help develop a collaborative plan for the systematics and ecology of rattans and provide for a joint survey on rattan flora in Vietnam. The Indo-Burma region of tropical Asia contains some of the most diverse and threatened terrestrial habitats in the world. This visit is part of a long-term taxonomic study and conservation assessment of the rattans (Palmae) in this region. <br/>The research will produce the first authoritative, specimen-based treatment of rattans in several key countries in the regions. The research is of particular taxonomic value because of its regional approach, i.e. a similar methodology and a shared specimen database is used in each country assessment. This approach avoids the common problem of unidentified specimens from one country being described a new local endemics when they may be a well-known species in a neighboring country. The coupling of collecting activity with line-transect sampling of targeted genera is a significant advance in the efficient characterization of botanical diversity. The results of the proposed research will also assists in the training of local scientists and field crews in the methodologies of collecting and processing rattan specimens and conducting quantitative inventories will have significant implications for rattan conservation and the monitoring of wild stocks. It is also anticipated that future research will provide unique training and educational opportunities for U.S. graduate students by enabling them to obtain a global experience. It is anticipated that these early collaborations between the scientists and students from each country will lead to long-term collaborations that will benefit both institutions.

These data are obtained and integrated using a variety of approaches: electron back-scattered diffraction to determine crystallographic orietnation, electron microprobe analysis to document mineral composition and zoning, X-ray computed tomography and serial sectioning/image analysis to obtain 3-dimensional views of textures, and modeling methods to explore crystal growth in the context of deformation (e.g., Elle microstructural modeling). <br/><br/>This investigation focuses on the growth of garnet, an important metamorphic mineral for recording pressure, temperature, time, fluid, and deformation information during metamorphism, and the basis for many studies of metamorphic crystallization processes. Specific questions being studied are: What does the presence of high-angle misorientation boundaries in morphologically coherent crystals of garnet indicate about garnet nucleation and growth? And, because these boundaries are rare in other porphyroblasts: Do garnets grow by different mechanisms than other porphyroblasts? A hypothesis to be tested is that the boundaried form during early coalescence of garnets that grow prior to development of growth zoning, and that the boundaries represent special low energy orientations.<br/><br/>This project represents part of the Ph.D. thesis of a University of Minnesota graduate student, Eric Goergen, and involve international collaboration with Dr. Mark Jessell (Toulouse). The research also involves undergraduate research assistants at Minnesota and summer interns from other institutions as part of an NSF-REU site. Results are being incorporated into a new teaching module that focuses on the Dutchess County, NY, Barrovian sequence; the module is distributed through the Teaching Petrology website.

To improve our ability to predict the dynamics of carbon in high latitudes, this team analyze comprehensively the carbon cycle of the arctic system, guided by the following general questions: What are the geographic patterns of fluxes of CO2 and CH4 over the Pan-Arctic region and how is the balance changing over time and What processes control the sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4 over the Pan-Arctic region and how do the controls change with time?<br/><br/>To address these general questions, the group will integrate data on CO2 and CH4 dynamics of the Arctic System using a combination of prognostic and inverse approaches and provide an integrative approach to estimating and understanding the exchanges of CO2 and CH4 from terrestrial and marine components of the system.<br/><br/>Because the climate system is vulnerable to significant releases of CO2 and CH4 from high latitudes, the responses of these gases to climate change have global consequences. This study will bring together diverse regional data sets and understanding in the context of a linked set of numerical model studies. It will examine, and attempt to quantify, the fluxes and links between the terrestrial, atmospheric and oceanic components of the Arctic carbon and methane cycles.

Past research has largely focused on testing the stability of models. This proposal is concerned with the natural next step: How does one do inference in unstable time series models? <br/><br/>The first project concerns efficient inference on the time varying path of the parameters in general likelihood models, including the special case of efficient estimation of the parameter path. Knowledge of the path is of primary interest for many purposes: (i) it helps understand the source of the instability, (ii) the endpoint of the path is intimately linked to efficient forecasting and (iii) economic theory sometimes implies specific forms of instability, such that inference on the path becomes a test of economic theory. The main result is that asymptotically efficient inference on the path may be obtained by treating the sequence of score vectors, evaluated at the usual maximum likelihood estimator that ignores the instability, as a Gaussian local level model. This in particular implies that an efficient path estimator can be obtained by applying a simple Kalman smoother to the sequence of scores. <br/><br/>The second project addresses the question of how to conduct valid inference on a subset of stable parameters in a Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) framework when other parameters are time varying. Partially stable models arise naturally when optimizing agents adapt to policy changes, which induces time variation in their reduced form behavioral equations, such as Euler equations. One of many possible applications of this research is how to conduct inference on the stable structural parameters, describing technology and preferences. The main-and maybe surprising-result is that standard GMM inference, ignoring the time variation, remains asymptotically valid on the stable subset of parameters. A third and unrelated project develops 'robust' long-run variance estimators. <br/><br/>The projects address first order problems for applied time series econometricians. The approaches are innovative, and careful arguments are employed to solve the technical difficulties. From an econometric theory point of view, the results arguably represent substantial advances in the understanding of unstable time series models. Some of the results are generic and may be used in other contexts. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: While based on technically sophisticated arguments, the main results of this research are very straightfoward to apply. Given the prevalence of parameter instability in practice, this research should therefore have a major impact on empirical research. This includes tests of economic theory, forecasting and policy analysis. Dissemination of the project's ideas and results will be facilitated through presentations at universities and conferences, as well as freely available computer code. Finally, through collaborations with graduate students and research assistance, the proposal has a direct impact on student training.

Two important issues that concern designers are efficient task scheduling to<br/>meet real-time constraints and the reduction of system-wide energy consumption for<br/>increased reliability.<br/><br/>Over 50% of failures in embedded systems are closely related to operating temperatures.<br/>These in turn are determined by the power consumption of the computational components<br/>of the system. This research seeks to develop peak power constrained scheduling methods to alleviate these reliability concerns. The project pursues the development of a peak power model to accurately describe the power constraints in a distributed embedded system, thereby allowing for a safe and effective use of the available computational resources during periods of high load. The uniqueness of this approach is its focus on distributed embedded systems with varying workloads. Power aware partitioning (PAP) schemes for hybrid architectures comprising processors and reconfigurable components, such as a Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), provide system designers with tuning capabilities for performance and real-time scheduling of system tasks. The project investigates the development of fast power-aware task partitioning algorithms in hybrid embedded systems.

This instability describes the rapid conversion of the twist component of magnetic helicity (the winding of the field lines about an axis) into writhe (winding of the axis itself). The PI asserted that recent observational studies concluding that active regions have insufficient magnetic twist to enable the kink instability have suffered from systematically underestimating the twist. The proposers offered here a new observational method with different assumptions, and stated that initial blind tests indicated that this method could successfully recover the twist known to be present in numerical simulations. The proposed new method will give a clearer indication of the role of the kink instability by improving upon the recent studies that have ruled out the kink instability based on what the proposers considered to be inappropriate assumptions.<br/><br/>The results of this study will aid in determining which mechanism(s) gives rise to solar energetic events. The proposed work will identify flux ropes and evaluate their twist for a significant number of active regions, using vector magnetic field data in both the photosphere and chromosphere. The project goal will be to examine whether the kink instability can play a role in solar energetic events; the focus will be on establishing the necessary rather than the sufficient conditions for the occurrence of this mechanism in the Sun. <br/><br/>For broader impacts, the vector magnetic field data used in this study, both photospheric and chromospheric, will be made available to the solar research community. The proposers will advise a graduate student from the Air Force Institute of Technology, as well as continue their ongoing public outreach programs and the mentoring of young women.

This makes it increasingly difficult to supply energy to devices and to cool these devices. Poweraware computation is especially important in the domain of sensor networks which are composed of small battery-powered nodes. Power management in sensor networks is viewed as so critical that it must be dealt with at all layers of the protocol stack.<br/><br/>Many power management techniques have been proposed and implemented. Most of these techniques are similar in that they reduce or eliminate power to some or all components of the device. However, there is an inherent conflict between power management and performance; in general, the more power that is available, the better the performance that can be achieved. As a result, it is generally proposed that power reduction techniques be preferentially applied during times when performance is less<br/>critical. However, this requires a policy to determine how essential performance is at any given time and how to apply a particular power reduction technique. For example, to use the frequency scaling technique, where the speed of the clock is changed dynamically, one needs a policy to set the speed at each point in time. There is a growing consensus that these policies must incorporate information provided by applications and high levels of the operating system, and that current tools and mechanisms for power management are inadequate and require more research. The authors propose to formalize power<br/>management problems as optimization problems, and then develop algorithms that are optimal by these criteria. The goal of this research is to develop effective algorithms for specific problems within the domain of power management, as well as to build a toolkit of widely applicable algorithmic methods for problems that arise in energy-bounded and temperature-bounded computation. The authors propose to initially focus on problems that deal with speed scaling and power-down techniques, since these are currently the dominant techniques in practice.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The authors propose to both develop fundamental theoretical techniques, and to apply these techniques to attack timely and important applications in computer systems. Both PIs have an established track record of working closely with researchers in applied areas to ensure that the theoretical models developed match the associated real-world problems. This is essential for theoretical results to have an impact. This work will continue to foster this very productive cross-fertilization between<br/>these experimental systems researchers and theoretical computer science. The students supported under this grant will be influenced by this philosophy of research. They will be trained to be proactive in working with researchers in applied domains to bring important and interesting problems into the theory community. They will also be encouraged to publish the resulting work in systems as well as theory conferences to ensure that new algorithmic discoveries have an impact. As part of this project, the authors also plan to continue outreach work to high schools students, encouraging underrepresented groups to choose careers in technology related fields. They have developed a talk outlining diverse opportunities within computer science and plan to involve graduate and undergraduate students in presenting this talk at local high schools. The work in this proposal is featured in the talk. In addition, they plan to involve students from underrepresented groups in research projects related to power management.

Abscission (cell separation) occurs in specialized cell types and requires the secretion of enzymes that dissolve the glue-like substance holding neighboring cells together.  The focus of the proposed research is to investigate the link between cell separation and the secretory pathway revealed by studies of the NEVERSHED (NEV) gene.  Mutations in NEV, a predicted G-protein regulator, prevent floral organ shedding in Arabidopsis and cause cellular defects in vesicle trafficking. These data suggest that NEV may regulate the movement of specific proteins required for cell separation.  <br/><br/>Using genetic, molecular, cell biological and biochemical approaches, the following questions will be addressed. (1) What pathway does NEV act in to control abscission? A set of mutants that restore floral organ shedding in the nev mutant will be characterized.  Analysis of these mutants should identify other proteins that interact with or act downstream of NEV during the cell separation process. (2) How does NEV function and what stage of vesicle trafficking does it regulate? Assays will test NEV enzymatic activity using representative G-proteins. To determine the site of NEV activity within the cell, the location of known markers of plant subcellular compartments will be compared with that of the NEV protein. (3) What other roles does NEV play during development?  To fully define NEV function, mutations in three other closely-related genes will be identified.  By characterizing plants with mutations in NEV and each related gene, additional roles likely masked by genetic redundancy will be uncovered.   <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include training opportunities for young scientists and the potential to improve crop yields and simplify harvesting that would result from a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control abscission.<br/>

The investigators are developing a template and instructional guide format for online laboratories that maximizes student learning. Using this template and format, the project team is installing hardware and related software to allow virtual remote control of a set of expensive laboratory equipment. To make the experience more realistic, the investigators are developing an affordable package of laboratory equipment that students can purchase and use at home to support interaction with the centrally located equipment. They also are producing video instructions for the laboratory activities in 71 different on-line laboratory experiments and an on-line resource for dealing with frequently asked questions. The project will provide remote access to on-campus laboratory equipment for on-line courses for students that maximize the potential for success of students with varying learning styles and hands-on learning needs. The laboratory model for distance learners is being disseminated via the South Carolina ATE National Resource Center, through a faculty workshop, and through conference presentations.

For example, route guidance models allow for the investigation of benefits (to the individual vehicle and the system) of information provision to drivers, while signal optimization programs determine near-optimal signal timing given traffic data. Traditionally, this breakdown of models into the vehicle and infrastructure domains has been appropriate in that there has been little or no dynamic interaction between the two systems. Signal control systems, for example, currently determine signal timing based on historical data or, in the best case, incorporate dynamic control that is driven by data from loop detectors or other fixed sensors. There is, however, no near real-time information available directly from the vehicles, such as speed, previous locations, vehicle origin and destination, and driver preferences. Vehicle route guidance systems also use historical and near real-time traffic data to assist drivers in route selection but typically do not explicitly consider the phasing of nearby signals. Given the current investigation of technical issues associated with vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure communication (referred to as vehicle-infrastructure integration - VII), there is a need to critically examine how such an infrastructure could be used to improve surface transportation. This project proposes both development of modeling tools capable of capturing such networking and development of methods for beneficial integration. The fundamental basic questions that the investigator and his colleagues explore are, therefore, 1) What information should be provided?, 2) Who should receive information?, 3) When should the information be provided?, and 4) How will the information be used?<br/><br/>The automobile is the dominant mode of surface transportation in the United States. The surface transportation system that has developed to enable this mode of travel is made up of two components: (1) individual travelers in their automobiles (referred to as vehicles), and (2) the roadway/traffic control network (referred to as infrastructure). To date, these components are managed in an independent manner. Drivers make decisions with very little knowledge of the entire networks status, and infrastructure operators make decisions regarding network control (primarily through signal systems) based on vehicle count data collected at limited locations. This lack of cooperation between the components has evolved primarily due to the lack of affordable information technology that would allow the components to easily share data and make collective decisions that would benefit the entire system. Practical benefits of such cooperation include route guidance which assists drivers in minimizing time spent at red lights. It also includes traffic signal systems which can sense and respond quickly to reduce vehicle stops and delays. As wide-area wireless networks become commercially available, and in-vehicle computer systems become affordable and pervasive, the information technology will soon be available to radically rethink how the surface transportation infrastructure should be operated. Because of their mandate and economic interests, the vehicle industry concentrates on research and development to improve the vehicle component of the system - with little consideration of the infrastructure. Similarly, transportation agencies concentrate on research to improve the infrastructure - with little consideration of the vehicle component. Thus, the science base currently does not exist to allow industry and public officials to best direct this new system. The investigators are developing the science and model base for integrated/cooperative surface transportation system control and management made possible by advanced information technology. This will allow for the investigation of the integration of information technology and the transportation infrastructure, a critical step in the evolution of the US transportation system.

This is an added activity to the 2005 annual Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications, which is scheduled for July 10 - 13 at this same site. The integration with a major topology conference should provide perspective and rigor to this nascent sub-discipline. The format is <br/>novel, leaving ample discussion time to engage the attendees in expanding and refining this emerging interdisciplinary research area. A main theme for computational topology is the development of efficient algorithms for maintaining the integrity of objects with respect to a variety of topological characteristics.<br/><br/>Already, this workshop has garnered led to its organizer, T. J. Peters, being invited to serve as an editor on computational topology for the forthcoming monograph, Open Problems in Topology, II, a volume which is expected to steer research activities for several years. Attendees will be invited to contribute problems.<br/>Graduate students and post-doctoral associates, from both the traditional topology and computational topology communities, have aggressively been recruited, with an attractive response rate. Papers from this workshop will also be considered for a special issue of the journal, Applied General Topology.

This is particularly true in visual perception, where an intelligent system is faced with reasoning about the complexity of a changing three-dimensional world given only two-dimensional images. Bayesian inference has become popular for dealing with such problems because it provides a sound way of combining ambiguous sensor measurements with prior knowledge about the world. Priors represent the collected experience of a perceptual system and by integrating heterogeneous sources of information in a statistically sound way enable such a system to respond robustly to novel situations.<br/><br/>Markov random fields (MRFs) provide a powerful and popular formalism for representing visual priors. However, they have typically modeled only local, pairwise pixel interactions, which limit their modeling capabilities. This project aims at increasing the power and applicability of these models using larger pixel neighborhoods (cliques). The proposed Fields-of-Experts (FoE) model generalizes many previous MRF models, and all its parameters can be learned from real-world training data. Preliminary experiments have shown that, for example, image reconstruction applications benefit from such richer visual priors, but many other application domains have remained unexplored. The development of these statistical modeling tools will also have an impact on other domains outside of machine vision where the need for modeling complex, high-dimensional data arises. Finally, the dissemination of the collected experimental data, learned models, and software promises to stimulate research and make possible quantitative comparisons towards better statistical models of the visual world.

Their main <br/>objective is to determine how different parasite groups, <br/>which differ in features of their biology and ecology, <br/>respond to identical geographical and habitat perturbations <br/>(diversification and speciation of the hosts). Studies of <br/>hosts and permanent ectoparasites provide a unique <br/>opportunity to reconstruct the history and the environmental <br/>context in which the processes of diversification and <br/>speciation occur. Permanent ectoparasites are hypothesized <br/>to share a common evolutionary history with their hosts, <br/>therefore, one can reconstruct this history of interactions <br/>between hosts and parasites by superimposing the parasite's <br/>evolutionary history onto the host's evolutionary history. <br/>The replicate parasite lineages included in this study live <br/>their entire life cycles on the same avian hosts, yet are <br/>members of different louse suborders that differ in a <br/>variety of biological and ecological features. By comparing <br/>these replicate parasite groups, this study will assess how <br/>unique features of each parasite's biology correlate with <br/>diversification in the hosts. Insights gained in this <br/>simple system will shed light on patterns of speciation and <br/>diversification in the more complex systems of free-living <br/>organisms.<br/> This project also has a number of important societal <br/>benefits. First, this work will document basic patterns of <br/>biological diversity in Amazonia, one the earth's richest <br/>ecosystems. It also will involve international <br/>collaboration between US and Brazilian researchers from the <br/>Field Museum of Natural History and the Museu Paraense <br/>Emilio Goeldi. Researchers and students will travel between <br/>these two institutions to teach, learn, work, and <br/>collaborate with each other to further our understanding of <br/>speciation and diversification in the tropics. This <br/>international collaboration will provide an unprecedented <br/>opportunity to study patterns of diversification and <br/>speciation in the Amazon. Second, studies of lice and their <br/>vertebrate hosts have played a prominent role in <br/>understanding the historical associations of hosts and their <br/>parasites. Theories and analytical methods developed using <br/>these model organisms have been applied to other systems <br/>such as vertebrates and their viruses, which are critical to <br/>human health issues. This project will further the <br/>biological understanding of these kinds of systems and will <br/>help us to understand the ecological characteristics that <br/>provide opportunities for disease causing parasites to jump <br/>between hosts.

Although a large body of work suggests that thermal, hydrochemical, and pressure distributions in faults may be driven by seismic activity and thermal-convective instability, establishing definite relationships between these factors has proven difficult, largely due to inability to observe subsurface processes directly. In this study, we will test the hypothesis that temperature and geochemical variability observed in fault-controlled springs are the result of a combination of seismic activity, thermal-convective instability, and environmental forcing (i.e., diurnal and seasonal atmospheric temperature changes). To test this hypothesis, we are gathering temperature data at 15 minute intervals from 18 geothermal springs that are in direct hydraulic contact with the Borax Lake fault, an active normal fault in the Alvord Basin of southeast Oregon. This temperature data will be analyzed using discrete Fourier analysis to establish the influence of periodic/quasi-periodic (i.e., environmental forcing) and seismic driving forces on spring temperatures. Residual variability in the time-series data not related to environmental and seismic drivers will be examined for evidence of non-linear deterministic behavior (i.e., chaos) that may arise from unstable convection or complex variations in the stress-field of the fault. Apart from its scientific/technical merits, this research will further graduate education in the geosciences, and enhance educational opportunities for undergraduates from non-PhD granting institutions by providing internships and/or summer research projects.

The gill is the major site of gas exchange, salt and water regulation, excretion of nitrogenous wastes, and regulation of blood pH. This study of regulation can provide important clues to a variety of physiological processes in fish, and vertebrates in general. Research will continue to investigate the role(s) of the local signaling agents (termed paracrines) such as endothelin (ET), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide ion (SO), and prostaglandins (PGs), in gill function. Current evidence suggests that all of these agents can alter blood flow through gill vessels, as well as salt transport across the gill tissue. Moreover, it appears that these agents may be members of a signaling cascade whereby (for instance) ET produces its effects via the production of PGs. The investigators will use a variety of physiological, immunological, and molecular techniques to determine the effects of these signaling agents and study their interactions under the conditions of salinity change. Unique training opportunities will occur for graduate and undergraduate students on this research in a wide range of physiological techniques including time spent at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory. This research will increase our knowledge of basic biology in fishes and will provide information about the evolution of these cellular signaling mechanisms in the evolution of the vertebrates.

The physical hypothesis underlying both the proposed observational studies and the modeling/data analysis efforts is that sea ice cover must be considered an intrinsic part of the oceanic boundary layer in models rather than a separate entity only transferring stress at the interface. This project will deploy two autonomous buoy arrays, as part of a collaborative ice-based observing system, to monitor mesoscale sea ice deformation in the East Siberian Sea and Beaufort Sea for one year. Evolution of sea ice thickness distribution at both drifting stations will be investigated, resolving both dynamic and thermodynamic processes. The study will elucidate the role of high frequency deformation in ocean-atmosphere fluxes, salt fluxes to the ocean, and ice mass balance. Coordination of observations with ice-ocean tidal-inertial modeling will provide insight into how nonlinear ice mechanics effects ice-ocean coupling and tidal characteristics. The principal investigators are developing a barotropic ice-ocean model including an upper ocean boundary layer with imbedded sea ice so that net Ekman transport in the upper ocean includes both ice and water. The focus of the modeling effort is on a detailed comparison with observations.

However, this practice reinforces assumptions of racial homogeneity and deflects attention from important intra-racial variation in social stress processes. Elevated stress during youth is now recognized to be a significant precursor to the development of adult chronic disease. Thus, understanding the impact of social stress variation among African American adolescents, who are at increased risk for stress-related diseases later in life, is particularly important. This dissertation research by a cultural anthropologist will employ structured ethnographic techniques to create a culturally salient measure of one important stressor - social status - for a high school community in a suburb of Chicago, IL. This measure will then be used to relate individual levels of social status with physical and cognitive/emotional measures of stress among African American youth. In addition to challenging overly-simplistic uses of race variables in biomedical research, this project will advance biocultural research approaches that link cultural, individual, and biological phenomena. <br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Racial disparities in health constitute a significant problem in the United States and lead to reduced general well-being and quality of life for many African Americans. While adolescent stress is clearly implicated in adult chronic disease development, black youth have been relatively underrepresented in health disparities and psychosocial stress research. Recent evidence suggests that stress reduction may significantly reduce blood pressure in African American youth. Thus, identifying stress processes related specifically to social status will potentially allow for prevention and intervention programs to be more tailored to meeting the needs of this at-risk group. In addition the project advances the education of a young social scientist.

The first two of these models (1-dim and 2-dim respectively) have been developed at the Flight Systems Research Center at UCLA in collaboration with NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. The designing of the 3-dim model is in progress. The 1-dim model has recently been tested in a series of four flight experiments at Edwards Airforce Base. The results have shown an excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of the model, at least, for lower frequency aeroelastic modes. The ultimate goal of the entire wing modeling projects is to give specific practical recommendations to aircraft industry engineers working on flutter suppression in aircraft wings. <br/><br/>The objective of this project include completion of the analysis of 1-dim model, i.e., obtaining the asymptotics for the eigenfunctions of the continuous spectrum and deriving the space-time domain representation for the solution of the main equations; b) applying the results to the flutter suppression problem; c) extension of the analysis to 2-dim and forthcoming 3-dim models (the most challenging part of the project); d) developing of a new graduate program on mathematical methods in aircraft engineering for both mathematics and engineering students
0515890	Gender, Caregiving and Nutrition among Luo grandparents	BCS	Biological Anthropology	08/01/2005	07/17/2008	Gillian Ice	OH	Ohio University	Continuing grant	Kaye E. Reed	07/31/2009	$265,000.00		iceg@ohio.edu	108 CUTLER HL	ATHENS	OH	457012979	7405932857	SBE	1392	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The project goal is to measure the impact of caregiving and gender on the nutritional status of Luo elders in Kenya. The high mortality rate of adults with HIV/AIDS has produced 11 million orphans, the care of which has largely been left to the elderly. As working-age adults fall ill and die, HIV affected households are likely to experience a decrease in household income and food availability. Several reports suggest that elder caregivers of orphans suffer from insufficient food but few studies have measured the nutritional status of elders or the specific factors which determine nutritional deficiencies. To accomplish the project goal, two groups of elders, caregiving and non-caregiving, will be compared with respect to nutritional status, food intake and activity levels over three years. Based on pilot research, it is expected that female caregivers will have poorer nutritional status than non-caregivers but male caregivers will be advantaged relative to their non-caregiving peers. This project will examine food intake or energy expenditure to determine which is most important in determining these differences. The project will also examine the allocation of food within the family to determine if the distribution of food is responsible for the differential impact of caregiving across genders. <br/> Prior to the HIV/AIDS crisis, many African countries made great strides in increasing life expectancy and the 50+ population is rapidly increasing. Now at the peak of the crisis, life expectancy has declined to half that of the pre-AIDS generation. Thus, the current cohort of elderly is unique. As the epidemic progresses, it leaves behind the youngest and the oldest. These survivors of AIDS must adapt to a rapidly changing social world. The scientific merit of this study is that it will add to our understanding of nutritional adaptation during social change. The focus on elder nutrition also allows a greater understanding of the variation in the aging process.<br/> The broader impact of the project is the knowledge which will contribute to the solution of the HIV/AIDS orphan crisis. An estimated 30-39% of Luo adults living in Nyanza Province are infected with HIV. Survivors of AIDS live in an environment of social stigma and loss as well as economic, nutritional and physical stress. Relatively little systematic research has been conducted on the impact of the HIV/AIDS crisis on older adults in Africa yet without their role, the survival of the population is in jeopardy. Ultimately, by understanding factors which lead to undernutrition in elder caregivers, interventions can be developed to enable grandparents to more effectively care for orphaned grandchildren.

To improve our ability to predict the dynamics of carbon in high latitudes, this team analyze comprehensively the carbon cycle of the arctic system, guided by the following general questions: What are the geographic patterns of fluxes of CO2 and CH4 over the Pan-Arctic region and how is the balance changing over time and What processes control the sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4 over the Pan-Arctic region and how do the controls change with time?<br/><br/>To address these general questions, the group will integrate data on CO2 and CH4 dynamics of the Arctic System using a combination of prognostic and inverse approaches and provide an integrative approach to estimating and understanding the exchanges of CO2 and CH4 from terrestrial and marine components of the system.<br/><br/>Because the climate system is vulnerable to significant releases of CO2 and CH4 from high latitudes, the responses of these gases to climate change have global consequences. This study will bring together diverse regional data sets and understanding in the context of a linked set of numerical model studies. It will examine, and attempt to quantify, the fluxes and links between the terrestrial, atmospheric and oceanic components of the Arctic carbon and methane cycles.

At <br/>high bit-rates, however, nonlinear and stochastic physical effects <br/>contribute to limit the overall system performance. The deterministic <br/>impairments are mainly due to the combination of nonlinearity and <br/>dispersion. The stochastic impairments occur due to amplifier noise <br/>(which induces amplitude, timing and phase fluctuations) as well as <br/>polarization-mode dispersion. All of these effects produce impairments <br/>which lead to unacceptable rates of transmission errors. However, <br/>the large scale and complexity of these systems, the variety of effects <br/>involved, and the extremely low bit-error-ratios required of these <br/>systems (which requires studying the occurrence of extremely rare <br/>events) all contribute to make the modeling of optical fiber <br/>communications a challenging task.

This research project aims at evaluating the potential of <br/>new transmission formats and assessing how each of them is affected <br/>by the various transmission impairments. The methods that will be <br/>developed in this project are expected to make an impact on how <br/>these systems are modeled and designed. In addition, because <br/>new ultra-short pulse lasers share many similarities with <br/>dispersion-managed optical transmission systems, the mathematical <br/>techniques that will be developed as part of this research project <br/>will help researchers understand the behavior of these lasers and <br/>their fundamental limits.<br/><br/>The development of high-capacity optical fiber communications has <br/>been a major technological advance that enabled the widespread use <br/>of the internet and the world-wide-web which revolutionized our <br/>day-to-day interactions.

A key feature of this <br/>collaborative research project is the combined use of sophisticated <br/>mathematical and computational methods to model the behavior of <br/>realistic lightwave systems, with the aim of developing the accurate <br/>tools which are needed to efficiently study the behavior of optical<br/>fiber transmission systems and to design the next generation of <br/>systems. As such, the outcome of this project will contribute to <br/>strengthening the national infrastructure and maintaining U.S. <br/>competitiveness in an area which is of great national interest,<br/>thus benefiting not just researchers, but also the community at <br/>large.

Three key issues concerning homochiral porous metal-organic coordination networks (MOCNs) will be addressed, namely, rational synthesis of homochiral MOCNs with permanent porosity and appropriate functionalities, understanding of the framework stability of homochiral porous MOCNs under catalytic conditions, and the utilitization of homochiral porous MOCNs in practical enantioselective catalysis and separations. These chiral porous materials will combine the advantages offered by heterogeneous catalysts (such as catalyst recycle and re-use) and those offered by their homogeneous counterparts (such as homogeneity of active sites and selectivity). <br/>Heterogeneous catalysis is responsible for the production of the majority of commodity chemicals and is a cornerstone of the chemical industry. This project explores fundamentally new bottom-up approaches towards novel heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts which can be readily recycled and re-used and can prevent the leaching of often toxic metals from the catalysts into the organic products. Such catalytically-active homochiral MOCNs can lead to economical production of many chiral compounds for the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and fragrance industries. Graduate students and postdoctoral research associates participating in the proposed interdisciplinary research will be trained with the skills that are crucial to their future careers as Ph.D. chemists. The proposed research will also be integrated into the training of undergraduates and high school students. <br/><br/>

The aim is to develop theoretic understanding and<br/>derive numerical algorithms for the quadratic model reconstruction<br/>so that the inexactness and uncertainty inherent in the model due<br/>to the limitation of current technologies are reduced while certain<br/>specific mathematical conditions are satisfied. The most difficult<br/>task in the quadratic model reconstruction is to satisfy the associated<br/>constraints which could be inherited intrinsically from the physical<br/>feasibility of a certain mechanical structure or could be driven<br/>extrinsically by the desirable property of a certain design parameter.<br/>The greatest challenge, which is also an imperative requirement in<br/>practice, is that the reconstruction must be carried out using only<br/>partial eigeninformation which are available by the state-of-the-art<br/>computational techniques. The inverse problem of constrained model<br/>reconstruction is essential for the understanding and management of<br/>complex systems, yet many questions on the solvability, sensitivity,<br/>and computation remain unanswered. The investigators have made<br/>significant contributions to the quadratic model construction problems<br/>individually and now intend to extend their investigation and join<br/>expertise to these challenging inverse problems. This proposed work<br/>therefore should be of compelling independent interest within both<br/>the engineering and mathematical sciences communities.<br/><br/>In mathematical modelling, techniques of inverse problems that validate,<br/>determine, or estimate the parameters of the system according to its<br/>observed or expected behavior are critically important. This research<br/>concentrates on the inverse model reconstruction problems with their<br/>pertinence to physical and engineering applications. These problems have<br/>been strongly motivitated by scietific and industrial applications,<br/>including structural mechanics such as vibration control and stability<br/>analysis of bridges, buildings and highways, vibro-acoustics such as<br/>predictive coding of sound, biomedical signal and image processing,<br/>time series forecasting, information technology, and others. Thus this<br/>project will impact a wide variety of industries utilizing these<br/>applications, including aerospace, automobile, manufacturing and<br/>biomedical engineering. The greatest challenge facing these industries<br/>is to manufacture increasingly improved products with limited engineering<br/>and computing resources. A great deal of money and efforts have been spent<br/>in these industries to satisactorily perform the model updating task.<br/>However, the lack of proper theory and computational tools often force<br/>these industries to solve their problems in an ad hoc fashion. An improved<br/>analytical model that can be used with confidence for future designs is<br/>an essential tool in achieving this obejective. The propsed research has<br/>not only strong mathematical foundation but also significant matematical<br/>modelling and experimental aspects using idustrial data which should be<br/>instantly welcome by the industries. Furthermore, the students working<br/>on this project for four years will receive a valuable interdisciplnary<br/>training blending mathematics and scietific computing with various areas<br/>of engineering and applied sciences. Such expertise is rare to find,<br/>but there is an increasing demand both inacademia and industries.

They encompass hyperbolic groups, the fundamental groups of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds, free products and limit groups (also known as `fully residually free groups'), and thus are directly related to combinatorial and geometric group theory, to hyperbolic geometry, to topology and to logic. The purpose of this project is to examine some of the logical aspects of relatively hyperbolic groups. The elementary theory of a group consists of those first order sentences which are true in the group. This is an interesting and powerful invariant of a group, the study of which is still at an early stage. This project will answer questions about the elementary theory of relatively hyperbolic groups, and also what can be said about a group with the same elementary theory as a relatively hyperbolic group. This will lead to applications both to logic and also to geometric group theory.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Discrete groups arise as sets of symmetries of many geometric objects in mathematics. For this reason, the study of discrete groups impacts on, and is impacted by, a wide variety of fields in mathematics. The groups under consideration in this project are relatively hyperbolic groups, which arise naturally from within topology and hyperbolic geometry, as well as in combinatorial and geometric group theory and also in the study of the logic of groups. Relatively hyperbolic groups form a bridge between `negatively curved groups' (called hyperbolic groups), which are well understood, and `non-positively curved groups', which have been much studied but in many ways remain a mystery. The purpose of this project is to study relatively hyperbolic groups from the point of view of logic. In particular, what can formal logical sentences tell us about a group? To consider only formal logical sentences is quite a restrictive limit to place upon ourselves, and leads to a natural invariant of a group, called the elementary theory of a group. The elementary theory is the set of formal (first order) logical sentences which are true in a group. It is a powerful invariant, and yet there are different groups with the same elementary theory. This project will study the elementary theory of relatively hyperbolic groups and also investigate those groups with the same elementary theory as a relatively hyperbolic group. The methods come partially from logic but also from geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology.

Using the instrument, we plan to specifically address four fundamental issues related to semiconductors and organic nanostructures: (i) to determine the IR-dielectric functions of narrow-bandgap diluted magnetic semiconductors in order to decipher their band structure, and to understand the origin of their ferromagnetism; (ii) to investigate the phonon structure of Be- based semiconductors and to obtain their behavior as a function of alloy concentration; (iii) to explore how the dielectric function changes as a function of doping, strain, and temperature, and to better understand electron-phonon coupling, and coupled plasmon-phonon effects; and (iv) to measure the optical functions of layer-by-layer-grown nanostructures, consisting of nanoparticles and polyelectrolytes, and to relate them to the molecular conformation, structure, and orientation of these structures. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposal will be the following: (i) to significantly advance scientific research, and research training among physics and chemistry majors, which will subsequently influence students to pursue advanced degrees; (ii) by incorporating IR- ellipsometry experiments into several physics courses, all physics majors will be introduced to the fields of semiconductors and nanostructures, resulting in the increase in talent and number of students entering the scientific and technical workforce; (iii) to have a strong impact on minority groups, particularly women, in light of the high percentage of women (42%) majoring in physics at Kenyon (over twice the national average); (iv) to enhance the integration of teaching and research on campus; and (v) to promote interdisciplinary cooperation between the physics and chemistry departments. The goals of this project will be subject to evaluation using the Logic Model, and the results will be disseminated through publications and presentations. In addition, topics of the proposal will be presented to High School teachers as a part of the outreach program. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Ellipsometry is a technique that uses changes in light waves to study the properties of materials. With this tool we intend to investigate the behavior of materials that may be used in future electronic devices. Our investigations will focus on materials that incorporate magnetic properties into semiconducting materials similar to those currently used in transistors. Incorporating magnetism into these materials is a possible pathway to faster computers that run with less power and lower waste heat. At Kenyon College our student body is diverse, and includes a large percentage of women majoring in physics, so this tool will be used to introduce under-represented groups to scientific research.

The refractive index contrast guides light rays within the core via total internal reflection.  There is considerable motivation to develop materials synthesis and processing techniques that free integrated optics from complex vapor deposition fabrication processes.  There is likewise demand for new materials and architectures that offer increased bandwidth and greater compositional flexibility than conventional silica-glass based and crystalline waveguide materials.  We present results demonstrating that polymeric, glass nanocomposite, and colloidal sol-gel materials are highly promising waveguide materials that combine compositional flexibility with fast and relatively inexpensive processing requirements.  Initial waveguide propagation loss investigations reveal these materials exhibit losses of order 2 dB/cm.  Ongoing studies reveal that thermal reflowing of sol-gel waveguides is likely to reduce this loss below 1 dB/cm.  Continuing investigation of polymeric guides has demonstrated that fluorinated branched electro-optic dyes can be incorporated in low loss polymer hosts with thin-film losses of well below 1 dB/cm.  Both studies provide compelling evidence that these are promising new materials for waveguide applications.  In addition, we present important results demonstrating that waveguide design, fabrication, and characterization is an excellent training opportunity for advanced physics and chemistry undergraduates, and fills a critical need in preparing students for advanced study in materials science.   Continued progress on both research and student training is contingent on the acquisition of precision positioning and imaging equipment for the accurate measurement of optical propagation loss.  <br/><br/>Materials research has transformed the technological landscape through innovations such as optical fibers and lasers.  For example, highly efficient semiconductor lasers are well-matched to low-loss optical fiber, resulting in a wealth of telecommunications developments such as high speed Internet transmission.  The devices which prepare light signals for eventual transmission over fiber optic lines are referred to as integrated optics.  All integrated optics have in common material structures called waveguides that confine light signals to well-defined regions smaller than the thickness of a human hair.  There is considerable motivation for materials synthesis and processing techniques that simplify the fabrication of waveguide structures. At the same time, there is an urgent need to make the study of waveguide materials more accessible to undergraduate science students, in order to provide properly trained students for both graduate research and industry.  Several promising approaches that satisfy both the technological and training needs of the materials research community are based on polymeric and colloidal sol-gel materials.  Waveguides can be fabricated from these materials using simple coating techniques, and both offer considerable compositional flexibility.  The utility of any novel waveguide material depends on its ability to transmit light with minimal attenuation, thus making the assessment of optical losses due to absorption and scattering an essential component of any waveguide materials research effort.  Our preliminary results strongly suggest that polymeric and colloidal sol-gel materials can yield optical losses suitable for applications.  Continued progress on both research and student training is contingent on the development of precision positioning and imaging equipment for the accurate measurement of optical propagation loss.  <br/><br/>

What is less well understood is how the spatial and temporal variability in mesoscale forcing influences cross-shelf and along-shelf structure of mid-trophic communities and the transfer of carbon from zooplankton and fish to top predators. The investigators will examine mesoscale and finer-scale spatial and temporal relationships between top predators (marine mammals, seabirds), their prey and physical-biological processes in the northern California Current System (CCS) with data sets collected during the multi-ship GLOBEC NEP effort that surveyed waters off Oregon and northern California in 2000 and 2002. Variability in the productivity of the CCS is notably large owing to climate variability on time scales ranging from days (upwelling) to interannual (ENSO) to decadal (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, PDO). While these trends can be best seen from a large-scale view, it is at the mesoscale or finer-scale perspective that predators are exploiting the patches of prey that become available. Two major null hypotheses will be tested: 1) mesoscale forcing, that alters the alongshore upwelling front and equatorward jet, does not affect the cross-shelf and along-shelf density and community structure of top predators; and 2) the spatial scale of plankton and nekton distribution, measured by spatial autocorrelation, is everywhere comparable to that of physical parameters; in turn, the spatial scale of planktivore or piscivore distributions is comparable to the scale of plankton and fish distributions, respectively. The investigators will construct a predictive model of factors affecting top-predator distribution based on 2000 data and will test it using 2002 data. They will also estimate predator abundance and distribution using general additive models and construct a carbon flow model to estimate carbon egested, respired and sequestered by upper trophic levels (as well as carbon removed by migrants). Several modeling approaches will be used to determine the magnitude and significance of prey correspondence or depletion at a range of scales. Spatial heterogeneity will be examined at two levels of the ecosystem: the density or patch size of prey relative to physical oceanographic features and the density of predators relative to their prey. The syntheses proposed herein provide a valuable baseline, for the early part of this century, on top predator response to several scales and sources of variability in the northern CCS. In addition, the synthesis forwards the longer-term development of predictive biophysical models of occurrence patterns of top-predators (many of which are endangered species) in the CCS. Evolution of such models will assist with resource management and planning of human activities (e.g., major fisheries, 5 marine sanctuaries, transportation and commerce) in the northern California Current ecosystem off the west coast of the U.S.

Erickson<br/>Affiliation:   Cornell University<br/>Collaborative Research - SST: Integration of Spectroscopic Sensors and Electroactive Nanowell Arrays with Microfluidic Chips Based on Thermocapillary Actuation<br/><br/>Microfluidic devices for liquid dosing, transport and mixing are driving innovation in genomic and pharmaceutical research as well as rapid commercialization of portable kits for home, industrial or military use. Such devices, predicted to revolutionize portable chemical detection and analysis, are expected to generate over 2 billion dollars in income by 2010. The newest open format devices, based on actuation of free surface flows, i.e. liquid-liquid or gas-liquid interfaces, provide an especially attractive platform for highly sensitive detection of adsorbed species. Essential to the operation and control of these devices is development and integration of sensing arrays for high resolution, autonomous identification of sample position, volume, temperature, speed, composition and molecular species.  This research program targets the development and integration of miniaturized optical, spectroscopic and electroactive sensors with thermofluidic chips. The three-part program includes (a) integration of thin film waveguides with open fluidic devices for evanescent sensing of stationary or moving samples, (b) development of a novel liquid-core waveguide based on thermocapillary actuation of microscale rivulets and (c) development of electroactive nanowell traps for electrostatic confinement and concentration of biomolecules. The waveguide sensors will be used to monitor droplet location, composition, rate constants for chromogenic reactions, and binding to functionalized quantum dots in a liquid suspension. Additional signal enhancement will be explored through evanescent coupling to micro-ring or micro-disc resonators fabricated on the chip surface. The electroactive nanowell sensor arrays positioned beneath stationary or moving droplets will allow development of an electrical impedance spectroscopic technique for use as an environmental sensor of aqueous borne bacterial pathogens. Sensor development and optimization will proceed through experiment, theoretical modeling and numerical simulations.  The broader impacts of this grant are as follows:  The interdisciplinary nature of the research will allow development of a novel fluidic chip with integrated sensing arrays and provide students with unique training at the crossroad of microscale transport phenomena and photonics, two high growth areas with numerous applications to bio- and nanotechnology. Undergraduates will be recruited through the NSF REU programs at Cornell and Princeton to aid with chip and nanowell fabrication, assembly of simple prototypes and data analysis. Students will be trained in the physical and engineering principles governing advanced optical and electrokinetic sensing platforms; they will also develop demonstration units for undergraduate lab courses and K-12 education. The Princeton PI will expand a current course on microfluidic phenomena to include a 2nd semester on sensing principles for miniaturized devices. She will also be leveraging this study toward establishment of a new Princeton Center on Advanced Fluidic Technologies, a large scale pilot program currently under consideration by the New Jersey Commission on Jobs Growth and Economic Development The Cornell PI will design a new course geared toward modern engineering and fabrication techniques of optical and spectroscopic sensors for lab-on-a-chip technologies. The PIs will jointly organize sessions on optofluidics and sensing at the IEEE Tranducers and SPIE Optical Information Systems meetings. <br/>
0528605	Sensors: A Novel Protein Immobilization Technique for Protein Array Sensors with High Stability, Multiple Functionalities, and Excellent Sensitivity	CBET	INTERFAC PROCESSES & THERMODYN, SENSORS SOLICITATION	09/15/2005	03/30/2007	Shaoyi Jiang	WA	University of Washington	Standard Grant	Robert M. Wellek	08/31/2008	$393,414.00		sjiang@u.washington.edu	4333 Brooklyn Ave NE	Seattle	WA	981950001	2065434043	ENG	1414, 7447	0000, 7224, OTHR	$0.00	ABSTRACT - 0528605<br/>University of Washington<br/><br/>As sensor technology is developing rapidly to handle multiple analytes in complex media and a chip-scale sensor system is becoming smaller, there is an urgent need to develop a corresponding protein immobilization technique suitable for long-term chip storage without losing its bioactivity and for the convenient generation of multiple functional spots in one flow channel. Currently, protein arrays are often generated using spotting methods. The biggest drawback limiting widespread application of protein arrays is perhaps the poor stability (lifetime) of protein chips once spotting. Recent studies show that while some antibodies are more suited (or stable) on antibody arrays than others, many protein arrays will start to lose their bioactivity gradually after two weeks. Furthermore, surface chemistries for protein immobilization currently available, such as physical adsorption, covalent immobilization, protein A or G, and biotin/streptavidin, are not selective and will provide only one functional spot within one flow channel.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Recently, it is demonstrated in proof-of the-concept experiments by the PI's group that the DNA-direct protein immobilization technique is well suited to achieving the goals for chip stability and functionality. The DNA-directed antibody immobilization is achieved via ssDNA-antibody conjugates, each of which consists of an antibody chemically linked to an ssDNA and is designed such that the ssDNA has a sequence complementary to one of the ssDNA sequences attached to the surface. Before detection, a cocktail of different ssDNA-antibody conjugates is applied to the chip pre-functionalized with ssDNA probe molecules. Each antibody conjugate will be self-immobilized to a designated spot via DNA hybridization. In this way, the chip will be stored as a DNA chip and used as a protein chip. This will not only resolve the long-term storage issue of a protein chip, but also provide a simple and convenient way to create multiple functional spots in one flow channel. Furthermore, it has been shown that this new platform is 50 times more sensitive than the commonly used biotin/streptavidin platform. This work will focus on engineering aspects to realize this technology for various lab-on-a-chip biosensors. It consists of five tasks - (a) developing a new surface platform convenient for the fast generation of DNA arrays and synthesizing ssDNA-antibody conjugates, (b) designing multiple ssDNA sequences with high specificity, (c) testing the specificity and cross-activity of multiple ssDNA-antibody conjugates using a state-of-the-art eight-channel SPR sensor, (d) patterning a chip with different ssDNA sequences using a modified inkjet printer, and (e) realizing this technology on a glass substrate.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This technology will not only remove the key obstacle of long-term chip stability faced in conventional protein arrays, but also provide a selective protein immobilization technique to create multiple functional spots in one flow channel. The integration of this proposed protein immobilization technique with biosensors (all types) will make biosensors very powerful, including their robustness for multiple channels, stability for long-term chip storage, and high sensitivity and specificity in addition to one universal chip for all applications and convenient chip regeneration. The PI's group is collaborating with a variety of researchers to solve real-world problems using sensors. Support of this work will allow these people to access sensor technology to solve their problems. Many of undergraduate students in the PI's laboratory have been involved in sensor-related work. Support of this proposal will provide more multiple-disciplinary research and educational opportunities to these students and will provide valuable information to a new course on biological interfaces in biosensors and biomaterials under development by the PI.

Testing and refining the concept of steady-state mountain building requires identification of cases of transient response and dynamic feedback in compressive orogens, and documentation of the spatial and temporal scales at which crustal deformation responds to erosion. This project takes advantage of a unique natural experiment in the active fold-thrust belt of west-central Taiwan where enough modern seismologic, geodetic, structural and geochronologic data exist to assess how an orogen responds to rapid and abrupt changes in wedge volume at scales of tens of kilometers. The Puli embayment in the west-central Taiwan lies approximately 1.5 km lower than neighboring parts of the fold-thrust belt. Geologic and geodetic evidence suggests that thrusting occurs over the width of the topographic embayment, rather than being concentrated at the front of the thrust belt, as is the case in the adjacent part of the thrust belt to the south where the topography maintains a classic wedge shape. The hypothesized connection between strain and topographic gradients is tested by (a) development of a database of late Quaternary slip rates and deformation patterns using a combination of structural, geochronologic and geomorphic methods, and (b) use of a 3D finite element model to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions required to produce the observed topography and deformation patterns. Fault-slip rates are obtained via dating of deformed stream terrace and basin fill deposits. Age dating also enables testing and calibration of long-term stream incision laws. The calibrated laws provide a quantitative basis for topographically derived estimates of strain patterns in inaccessible or poorly constrained areas of the belt such as the Alishan Range.

Kimbrel	06/30/2008	$200,000.00		ronitt@csail.mit.edu	77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE	Cambridge	MA	021394301	6172531000	CSE	2860	9218, HPCC	$0.00	In a wide variety of computational settings, where the data is most naturally viewed as coming from a distribution, it is often crucial to determine whether the underlying distribution satisfies various properties. Examples of such properties include whether two distributions are close or far in statistical distance, whether a joint distribution is independent, and whether a distribution has high entropy. For most such properties, standard statistical techniques which approximate the distribution lead to algorithms which use a number of samples that is nearly linear in the domain size. Until very recently, distributions over large domains, for which linear sample complexity can be daunting, have received surprisingly little attention. However, new interest in these questions comes from many directions, including data mining, Physics and machine learning applications in Neurobiology. Recent results have shown that one can achieve results which are significantly more efficient than the standard techniques for the case of large domains.<br/>The intellectual merit of this research will lead to an understanding of the sample, time and space complexity required to identify various natural properties of a probability distribution. The proposed research will focus on determining which properties can be understood with a number of samples that is sublinear in the domain size, and will lead to an understanding of the aspects of algorithm design that are specific to these constraints. The questions that will be considered range from considering the complexity of testing previously unstudied properties, finding general techniques which apply to classes of distribution testing problems, investigating new models of distribution testing, understanding structural aspects of the testing problems that can be solved in sublinear time, and further understanding the relationship between the computational complexity and sample complexity.<br/>The broader impact of this proposal includes educational and workforce development components. The educational component of this proposal involves designing course material on algorithms for testing distributions that would be appropriate for students at all levels. Enough material has been collected to develop a graduate course that highlights the body of techniques that have emerged in this field. Some of the recent advances are a perfect fit for conveying fundamental ideas behind randomized algorithms to undergraduates. The PI has been awarded two teaching awards for her efforts at undergraduate education. The PI will continue her efforts as an advisor and mentor to undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, which in the past have included several women who have gone on to successful research careers. The PI is currently co-organizing a Dagstuhl workshop on Sublinear Algorithms. A priority has been placed on inviting and supporting graduate students interested in working in the area. Finally, the ideas will also be disseminated through the use of the web, seminar, workshop and conference presentations, journal articles and survey articles aimed at a wider audience.

To prove the concept of 3D face expression recognition, the study will investigate the issue on how and what 3D facial features could make the 3D-based expression recognition better than 2D-based recognition. The analysis of 3D facial expressions will facilitate the examination of both the fine structural changes inherent in and the precise time course of spontaneous expressions. Although 3D modeling techniques have been extensively used for 3D face recognition and 3D face animation, barely any research on 3D facial expression recognition has been reported. A primary reason why such research has not yet been undertaken is that no 3D expression database exists. As a proof-of-concept, a state-of-the-art 3D dynamic facial expression database will be constructed to test the algorithms and make it public to the research community to foster the research in the field. The project aims to achieve a high rate of accuracy in identifying a wide range of facial expressions, with the ultimate goal of increasing the general understanding of facial behavior and 3D structure of facial expressions on a detailed level. As a result, this exploratory research will lead to building a humanized system for recognizing spontaneous facial expression, which is crucial to the next generation of human computer interaction, security, human affect recognition, biomedicine, law-enforcement and psychology research.<br/><br/>This project will facilitate research on the next generation of human-computer interaction through automatic 3D facial expression recognition. It will help increase the scientific understanding and modeling of cognitive processes of the human visual system. The resulting system and the 3D facial expression database will be valuable for applications in security, law-enforcement, biomedicine, behavior science, entertainment and education. The 3D face expression database will be made available to the entire research community. As an academic institution, SUNY Binghamton has a large and diverse student and staff population. This will facilitate scanning many people of diverse ethnic backgrounds for the database. The results of this research can be integrated into graduate and undergraduate courses at SUNY Binghamton related to image processing, computer vision, and computer graphics.
0508688	DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Effect of Forest Fragmentation on Seed Dispersal and Forest Regeneration in the Central Amazon	DEB	POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG	07/01/2005	07/06/2005	Henry Howe	IL	University of Illinois at Chicago	Standard Grant	Alan James Tessier	06/30/2007	$12,000.00		hfhowe@uic.edu	809 S MARSHFIELD	Chicago	IL	606124305	3129962862	BIO	1182	1128, 1182, 9169, EGCH, SMET	$0.00	The effects of forest fragmentation on seed dispersal and neotropical forest regeneration are poorly understood. Research in the Amazon has shown that potential seed dispersers (primates, understory frugivorous birds, and bats) have lower densities in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. In contrast, potential seed predators (terrestrial small mammals) are more diverse and abundant in fragments. These studies suggest that seed dispersal may be lower, and seed predation higher in small fragments, however no studies have tested this. The proposed project will be the first to assess the effect of forest fragmentation on tree regeneration dynamics in the central Amazon and quantitatively relate these effects to modifications in plant-animal interactions that are hypothesized to influence tree regeneration. We will quantify tree seedling species richness and composition in forest fragments (1, 10, and 100 ha) and continuous forest. We will simultaneously measure seed rain, seed predation, and herbivory. We will test the hypothesis that forest fragmentation negatively affects forest regeneration through losses in frugivores and simultaneously test the alternate hypotheses that seed predation, herbivory, or edge effects negatively impact upon biodiversity and composition of tree regeneration. <br/><br/>The discovery and measurement of dispersal limitation of forest regeneration will have major implications for land management in the neotropics, as it will contribute to estimates of the minimum fragment size and the maximum fragment isolation that can allow sustained regeneration. The research will also identify links between seed dispersers, predators, and fragment size that can be used in predictive models to determine the effects of land use practices on native forest species.

Both study areas contain a variety of igneous rocks emplaced 850-700 million years ago, which is a critical time frame in Earth history. During this interval, the ancient supercontinent of Rodinia was beginning to break apart, setting the stage for subsequent rearrangement of continental land masses to form the younger Gondwana supercontinent. The team is carrying out paleomagnetic studies on an extensive suite of samples from selected rock units in the Kalahari and Congo cratons in order to constrain the original relative positions of the two cratons during breakup of Rodinia and prior to assembly of Gondwana. This work is coupled with a detailed program of isotopic dating, designed to produce rigorous constraints on the age of magnetization in the rocks and to determine whether the primary magnetization has been disturbed by subsequent thermal events. The Congo and Kalahari cratons formed the keystone of central Gondwana, which was assembled about 550 million years ago as different parts of the present-day southern continents collided. Acquisition of well-dated poles from both cratons will allow testing of competing models for Gondwana assembly: were the Congo and Kalahari cratons separated by a wide ocean basin before formation of Gondwana or were the two cratons already in roughly their present-day relative positions. The latter scenario would imply that the central part of Gondwana was inherited from the earlier Rodinia supercontinent, about which little is known. The project is collaborative in nature and involves workers at Texas Christian University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Texas at Austin in the US, and at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, the Geological Survey of Namibia, and the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. Students from both the US and Africa are involved in the field and laboratory work. This project is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.

Jordan of the University of Pittsburgh is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to continue his research on understanding the connection between localization of the proton defect and strong anharmonic effects in the vibrational spectra of protonated water clusters and excess electron-water cluster systems. Improved models for exploring the potential energy surfaces and for carrying out simulations on protonated water clusters are being developed. The Drude-model for treating the interaction of an excess electron with clusters of polar molecules that was developed during the previous award is being modified to permit its use in simulations of clusters containing twenty or more water molecules and will be combined with more sophisticated water models. A third research thrust involves mapping out the potential energy surfaces of small, conformationally flexible biomolecules, both isolated and solvated with one or more water molecules. The goals of this research are to characterize for selected systems all low-energy pathways at a sufficiently high level of theory to unambiguously establish the pathways accessed experimentally, and to provide data for testing and refining the polarizable force fields for subsequent use in characterizing more complex biomolecules. In terms of broader impacts, the PI has a strong track record of engaging undergraduates in research and in introducing undergraduate and graduate students to the field of computational science, including directing summer research programs for undergraduates for four years and establishing the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Molecular and Materials simulations.
0517771	Fitness Consequences of Sexually Selected Acoustical Signaling in American Bison	IOS	BEHAVIORAL SYSTEMS CLUSTER, ANIMAL BEHAVIOR	07/01/2005	04/23/2007	Michael Mooring	CA	Point Loma Nazarene College	Continuing grant	daniel wiegmann	06/30/2009	$365,889.00		mikemooring@pointloma.edu	3900 Lomaland Drive	San Diego	CA	921062810	6198492200	BIO	7472, 7659	9183, BIOT	$0.00	It is now clear that sexual selection (selection for traits that increase mating success) has led to the evolution of sexually dimorphic attributes in males. Whether in the context of male-male contests or female mate choice, many of these traits act as signals that contain information about mate quality. Studies of invertebrates and small vertebrates have revealed that such signals are often assessed by receivers so as to choose tactics that maximize reproductive success. Little is known regarding how signal assessment works in large mammals, in which multiple and changing signals must be evaluated concurrently over the course of the breeding season. The goal of this research is to investigate the production and assessment of the bellow vocalization of male bison, which is the most conspicuous hallmark of the bison breeding season. The aim is to clarify the role of the bellow signal in the reproductive success of breeding males. The central hypothesis is that useful information is contained in bellows that other bison can evaluate and use to their advantage. This hypothesis is based on strong preliminary findings that indicate that a number of bellow acoustical features reflect the quality of the signaling male. A necessary prerequisite to this study is an understanding of how reproductive success relates to mating performance and attributes that other bison may use to assess male quality. Therefore, an integral component of this project will be the use of molecular techniques to determine genetic parentage for comparison with male mating behavior. <br/> Bison will be studied at Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge where all adults are individually marked and open grassland terrain enables constant surveillance of breeding behavior. A multidisciplinary team of five collaborators will perform the laboratory analyses for genetic parentage, acoustics, and behavioral endocrinology that will complement behavioral observations. Dawn-to-dusk observations will document breeding behavior, and genetic parentage analyses will assign maternity and paternity to all calves. Bellowing will be recorded from dominant and subordinate males, and recordings analyzed to compare acoustical features with measures of signaler quality (reproductive success, competitive ability, condition, physiological state) and motivation (estrous condition of tended female, number of challenging males). Playback experiments will be conducted at night to evaluate the response of males to the acoustical features of synthesized bellows. Fecal samples will be used to measure male sex and stress hormones (associated with dominance and aggression), and female sex hormones (to determine hormonal estrus). The results will provide insights into similar species in which vocalizations play a role in breeding. Field and lab participation by undergraduate and graduate students will offer valuable learning experiences and preparation for future careers in science. Finally, information obtained on bison reproductive biology can be applied to the conservation of this keystone species and symbol of the American West.

This conference will bring together, and foster discussion among, scientists studying various aspects of atmospheric radiative transfer. The conference will have a first-rate, international line-up of 22 speakers and 9 discussion leaders that will secure continuity of the scientific excellence that has been a hallmark of Gordon Conferences for over 70 years. As Gordon Conferences are supported in part by Gordon Research Conferences, this proposal is seeking additional support to provide financial support of conference fees and/or travel costs for students, postdocs, and other young investigators as well as invited speakers and discussion leaders.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This GRC recognizes explicitly that much of what makes Earth's climate so complex, difficult to predict, and worthy of study arises from the four-dimensional interaction between radiation and the three phases of water. It is generally agreed that the most elusive of these interactions involve clouds, and so discussion of clouds and radiative transfer for cloudy atmospheres form the core of this GRC. The areas to be covered by the conference include: Hydro-Radiative Climatology Absorption and Scattering Radiative Transfer - I: Two-Stream Approximation and Averaging Radiative Transfer - II: Dynamical Models Radiative Transfer - III: Innovative Remote Sensing Cloud Observing Systems Assimilation of Cloud Data Modelling and Observing Clouds and Radiation Analyses of Cloud Feedbacks and Radiative Sensitivities. The above areas represent both basic and cutting edge research in the area of Radiation and Climate, and it is expected that the discussions will facilitate better understanding of the field and will provoke new research on unsolved problems.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Fourth Gordon Research Conference on Radiation and Climate is expected to be an exciting educational experience for all participants - students and established researchers alike. The students who participate in this activity will benefit by obtaining a better understanding of one of the fundamental physical processes governing the climate system - the transfer of electromagnetic radiation - AND its interaction with clouds - a primary, and perhaps the least understood, component of the climate system. Established researchers should benefit by an exposure to recent advances and new ideas in this field. Overall, the exchanges of ideas are expected to benefit society by encouraging further exploration and discoveries of the climate system, thereby perhaps increasing our capability for making useful predictions and assessments of anthropogenic impact on the climate system.

Bement, Adam Graves will examine the trace element content of bison teeth to determine their migratory patterns. Modern and prehistoric bison teeth from the Southern Plains will be analyzed to assess the interrelatedness of Bison antiquus - an extinct form of the North American buffalo - and human movements between 11,900 and 10,200 years ago. These Early Paleoindians are generally inferred to have been small groups of highly mobile large game hunters who increasingly depended on tracking bison herds for subsistence on the Southern Plains. Bison are a migratory species whose exact geographic location each year may not be predictable by hunters who are traveling long distances. Thus, knowing where bison traversed annually provides insight into the frequency and distance specialized hunters had to move to intercept this highly sought prey species.<br/><br/>Recent research concludes that animal movement may be assessed by examining tooth and bone chemistry. In addition to calcium and phosphate, enamel also consists of trace elements that are incorporated into the matrix during mineralization. The trace element content in teeth can be correlated with the trace element content of consumed soils, plants, and water which vary across the landscape on a geographical scale. This study will use Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP/MS) to examine the down-tooth distribution of 13 trace elements in enamel of 20 modern Bison bison from Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas to define the geographical limits and concentrations of specific minerals. In addition, 33 Bison antiquus teeth from nine Early Paleoindian locales on the Southern Plains will be analyzed. The modern bison enamel will provide an elemental map upon which the movements of extinct herds will be assessed. The knowledge of where Bison antiquus gathered would have allowed prehistoric hunters to plan movements or meetings around such aggregations. The research will attempt to reconstruct the scale and frequency of early Paleoindian mobility by examining the locations and timing of kills and the direction of bison movement across the plains.<br/><br/>The methods employed by this analysis will be of use to archaeologists, biologists, zoologists, and other natural scientists interested in determining any animal species' - including humans' - diet and mobility in any geographic and chronologic context. The involvement of geochemists, botanists, local bison ranchers, and state parks ensures that the methods used and information learned of the relationship between human settlement and their resources will be shared with a wide audience. Further, Graves will dessiminate the results of the research through publications, documentaries, and public lectures to a widespread audience thus assisting in his professional training.

The development and exploitation of MIMO technologies and Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocols have been popular subjects of wireless research. Hybrid ARQ is effective as protection against packet error in wireless communications, while MIMO transceivers have demonstrated significant performance gains at the wireless physical layer. However, traditional approaches treat MIMO schemes and ARQ as independent mechanisms in wireless networks. The design integration of hybrid ARQ protocols with MIMO transceivers has received scant coverage and has not been well utilized. As more and more mainstream products begin to adopt MIMO technologies in wireless LAN and other wireless systems, there is an urgent need to exploit and achieve the full potential benefit offered by integrating wireless ARQ and MIMO designs. This research project investigates the efficient integration of ARQ with broadband MIMO physical layer.<br/><br/>Simultaneously considering both designs of ARQ protocols and MIMO transceivers, the investigations of this project are systematic, integrative, and broadly applicable. Unlike in traditional wireless designs where ARQ and MIMO technology are treated separately, this integrative design approach opens a new door to developing future advanced wireless systems that are power and bandwidth efficient. While the advantages of cross-layer optimization are well known, the integrative design of ARQ protocols and their corresponding MIMO transceivers provides a concrete and tangible approach to cross-layer network design. Focusing on bandwidth and power efficiency, the project goal is to optimize and adapt ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) protocols for MIMO wireless systems to improve performance and scalability. The research presents new capacity analysis and transceiver optimization of progressive MIMO precoding to better exploit the ARQ retransmission diversity. The investigators develop design of bandwidth and power efficient transceiver technologies in full integration with new scalable ARQ designs to significantly improve the performance of end user applications. The results of this project provide new formulation of wireless MIMO channel estimation algorithms particularly tailored for bandwidth efficient and scalable hybrid ARQ protocols in future broadband wireless communication systems.

0517683	Transforming Sensory Signals into Muscle Activations in a Behavior with Dynamic Constraints	IOS	ENVIRON & STRUCTURAL SYS CL, ACTIVATION	08/01/2005	04/29/2008	Malcolm MacIver	IL	Northwestern University	Continuing grant	Martha Flanders	10/31/2008	$549,258.00	Kevin Lynch	maciver@northwestern.edu	1801 Maple Ave.	Evanston	IL	602013149	8474913003	BIO	7474, 7713	9178, 9183, 9251, BIOT, SMET	$0.00	Animals are thought to have diverged from plants more than 1.5 billion years ago. Basic to this split are different strategies for obtaining the energy needed for life: for a plant, it is stay in place and absorb, and for an animal, it is move around and grab. As soon as motion enters the scene, so do two quite different regimes under which motion can occur: the first is the viscous regime, in which an animal will stop in its tracks as soon as it ceases generating locomotory forces, and the second is the dynamic regime, in which an animal will keep moving even after it ceases generating such forces. For our fluid-bound ancestors, this transition occurred with the dawn of the multicellular animals around 0.6 billion years ago. Control of motion is much more difficult in the dynamic regime, a fact well known in the engineering of robotic systems. This sets the fundamental problem for nervous systems to solve: the transformation of sensory signals into motor signals in a manner that accounts for the animal's dynamic constraints. Dr. MacIver will lead a multidisciplinary group of researchers with expertise in neuroscience, robotics, and fluid dynamics to understand how sensory signals are transformed into motor signals by the brain of weakly electric fish, Apteronotus albifrons, with particular attention paid to how the dynamic constraints of the fish affect this transformation. The researchers hypothesize that neural structures supporting this transformation are simplified by sensory and motor capabilities that are well tuned to the dynamics of the task. The team's research objectives are to 1) reconstruct muscle activations occurring during prey-capture behavior; 2) reconstruct the sensory information about the prey reaching the brain during this behavior; and 3) develop a computational framework for transforming the reconstructed brain input into the estimated muscle activation signals. Experiments on real fish and on a virtual fish with realistic sensing and mechanics will be combined to test several key hypotheses, including the claim that a trajectory to the prey that minimizes the animal's effort will be identical to one that minimizes uncertainty about behaviorally relevant properties of the prey, such as its location. These studies require an ambitious interdisciplinary effort in neurobiology, computational neuroscience, fluid dynamics, and robotics. The research will have broad applicability to understanding the principles of sensorimotor transformations in animals. The group further expects that their work on the fluid dynamics of locomotion will have applications to animal flight and swimming, and the engineering of micro-air and aquatic vehicles. The project will also involve undergraduate students in aspects of the research and will develop a robotic fish installation to inform the public about this type of multidisciplinary research.

The two co-PI.s have worked together for two years and have successfully built a set-up for growing self-assembled monolayers (SAM). We are therefore experienced in all aspects of the proposed studies. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate and study electronic and spintronics processes in molecular devices made of SAM mixtures of conducting and insulating molecules with anchoring thiol end groups, upon tailoring the transport process between isolated molecules with 1D-like transport and aggregates with 2D-like transport. <br/><br/>SAM diodes will be fabricated from solution mixtures of molecular wires (1,4 benzene-dimethane-thiol, Me-BDT) with two anchoring thiol end groups, and molecular insulators (pentathiol, PT) with one anchoring thiol end group, at different ratio, r of wires/insulators on metallic ferromagnetic (FM) and non-FM electrodes that include gold and cobalt. At r << 10-3 the Me-BDT molecules should be isolated in the insulating PT matrix, whereas they would form two-dimensional (2D) aggregates at r > 0.1. We propose to check (i) the Me-BDT bonding to the opposite electrodes; (ii) Me-BDT molecular surface density, and (iii) Me-BDT molecular aggregate formation, using titration techniques of molecular tags that are borrowed from other Applied Science subfields. These measurements include optical absorption, vibrational spectroscopy, AFM microscopy, and electrochemical charge counting. <br/><br/>Using the fabricated SAM devices we will be able to study the charge transport properties of isolated and aggregated Me-BDT conducting molecules from the device I-V and differential conductance characteristics, measured at different temperatures. In addition spin transport properties of Me-BDT molecules and aggregates will be also obtained using magnetoresistance (MR) measurements, where the I-V characteristic of Co-based SAM devices will be studied as a function of an external magnetic field. From these measurements we expect to be able to clearly separate devices based on isolated molecular wires from those based on 2D molecular wire aggregates; a phase transition at a certain rc value is anticipated. All the necessary equipment for the SAM growth and set-ups for the device fabrication and testing are already in our laboratory. We have obtained preliminary results that show the feasibility of the proposed studies. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: These pilot research studies, if successful would show an alternative method of studying charge and spin transport in single molecules, and in molecular aggregates that show charge delocalization, using SAM devices. Our measurements have the potential to substantially advance the molecular electronic field using a reliable measurement technique. In addition the integration of our large arsenal of experimental efforts, including SAM growth, optics, magneto-optics, and device fabrication, processing and testing, will serve to efficiently educate the post-doctoral associate, and graduate and undergraduate students who will be involved in the highly interdisciplinary research projects. <br/><br/>This proposal is in the subfield of Nanoscale Devices and System Architecture.

The main contributions of the research include a new notion of forward-backward martingale problem (FBMP), along with a general framework for studying the well-posedness of the weak solutions of FBSDEs; and a study of stochastic characteristics for fully nonlinear SPDEs, a potential fundamental building block of the theory of stochastic viscosity solutions. The well-posedness of a class of FBSDEs with jumps and possibly super-linear growth coefficients, as well as its application to a class of optimal investment/reinsurance problems with general insurance models will also be investigated. The PI also proposes to continue his research on stochastic control and stochastic finance/insurance problems. Two particular problems: one involving the dynamic pricing of the Universal Variable Life insurance, and the other involving systems driven by normal martingales (or martingales satisfying structure equations) will receive strong attention. The latter is also considered as a theoretical extension of the proposed optimal reinsurance problem.<br/><br/>Almost all the proposed projects have strong background in applications, especially in stochastic control and stochastic finance/insurance. Many of these problems reflect the new trend of securitisation of risks in insurance products and pension plans, and the results are expected to have broader impact on actuarial mathematics, financial mathematics, and could benefit the insurance community for good contract designs. The proposed project on the weak solutions for FBSDEs, especially the new notion of FBMP, will fill the gap in the theory, which has been left open so far. The proposed project on stochastic characteristics of fully nonlinear SPDEs will bring new insight to the notion of stochastic viscosity solutions, and is expected to substantially advance the general theory.

Human activities now add more inorganic nitrogen (IN) to ecosystems than all natural processes combined, resulting in losses of biodiversity, increased pollution of groundwater, and often leading to weedy invasive species displacing natives. However, the mechanisms behind these community shifts remain unexplained. New studies exploring the importance of organic nitrogen (ON) to plants offer exciting and novel hypotheses. Recent research suggests that many temperate grassland communities are comprised of species adapted to nutrient poor environments, with few species able to capitalize on the relatively rare condition of abundant IN. Consequently, when IN becomes readily available, either through experimental addition or through deposition from human activities, most species present are unable to utilize this resource and are rapidly displaced by opportunistic weeds. My research will investigate drivers of biodiversity loss following IN addition by exploring how species differ in their abilities to use IN versus ON, as well as predict communities that are particularly sensitive to N deposition. I am currently involved in mentoring several undergraduate students from underrepresented groups who are conducting ecological research and by developing teaching modules on biodiversity for the Sunrise Park Middle School, and by working on similar collaborative projects with researchers from the United States and Europe.

While fuel cell electrodes typically have a complex micro- or nano-structure that is critically important in determining their performance, current methods for measuring electrode structure are quite limited. The aim of the proposed project is to develop a powerful new method - focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy - for fully characterizing three-dimensional electrode microstructure. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: A main aim of this research is to fully understand the relationships between electrode processing, structure, properties, and performance. This will ultimately allow design of higher performance and more stable electrode microstructures, as well as providing processing information needed to achieve these structures. The new methods and understanding will be included in new university course materials and in educational modules designed to reach a broad spectrum of age groups. This research is a collaborative effort with University of Washington and University of Michigan.

An illustration of this problem with worldwide significance is found in total joint replacements where ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) is used as the bearing surface and serves to replace diseased or damaged cartilage. In this application, PE sustains large cyclic contact stresses as the joint is articulated and the polymer is set in motion against a polished metal or ceramic component. In these prostheses, the polyethylene component usually articulates against a metallic or ceramic component, which leads to the generation of wear debris. Submicrometer size particulate debris is known to cause bone resorption and implant loosening, necessitating early revision surgery to replace the implant. In recent years, radiation crosslinking has emerged as a processing technique that can dramatically decrease the generation of particulate wear of polyethylene. This has led to its implementation in the processing of acetabular cups for total hip replacement prostheses. However, there are concerns about its use in knees and shoulders where high contact stresses are expected. This concern is valid as radiation crosslinking decreases certain mechanical properties, such as ultimate tensile properties, fracture toughness and resistance to fatigue crack propagation. Fatigue strength is the most important property from a clinical standpoint since these load-bearing components are subjected to cyclic loads. In this study, the investigator and her collaborator are using novel processing conditions that combine radiation crosslinking with high pressure, gas assisted processing techniques to improve the performance of PE as a bearing material. The processing of polyethylene using a pressurized soluble gas leads to improvement in fusion of polyethylene resin particles and improves tensile, fracture and fatigue properties. This is coupled with crosslinking that provides wear resistance. In this work, the researchers (I) fabricate bulk components of polyethylene using (a) radiation crosslinking, (b) gas-assisted processing utilizing carbon dioxide and an inert diluent and (c) high pressure processing in the presence of an inert gas, and combinations thereof; (II) characterize the morphology at the nano- and micro- scales and (III) evaluate concomitant mechanical properties of all types of polyethylene by conducting short term tensile and fracture toughness tests, long-term fatigue tests, and measurement of the tribological properties at nanoscale and microscale using nanoindentation and wear tests. The novelty of this interdisciplinary work stems from multiscale experimental studies that yield insight into the fundamental mechanisms of fatigue, fracture and wear in advanced polymers such as PE. The intellectual merit of this work is the systematic evaluation of morphology and micromechanisms of fatigue, fracture, and wear at the nanoscale and microscale levels. The broad impact of this work extends to clinical orthopedics, polymer materials science, mechanical engineering and bioengineering. This study involves the synergy of bioengineering, mechanical engineering, materials science and medicine, and provides educational opportunities at all levels including undergraduates, graduates, postdocs, and faculty.

When the sample size is large relative to the number of possible outcomes, for example when a biased coin is tossed many times,  estimation is simple. However, in many applications the number <br/>of possible outcomes is large compared to the sample size. For example, in language modeling - used in compression, speech recognition, and data mining - the number of words  and contexts is large compared to the amount of text at hand. Estimation in this large-alphabet regime is much more complex,  and has been studied for over two centuries. While some good estimators have been derived, for example those named after<br/>Laplace, Krichevsky-Trofimov, and Good-Turing, very few optimality properties have been established for them, and each is known to perform poorly under some conditions. <br/><br/>Adopting an information-theoretic viewpoint, the investigators undertake a systematic study of these issues. They concentrate on two broad problems, concerning the estimation of: (1) the probability of each observed outcome and of the collection of outcomes not yet observed; (2) the underlying distribution, which does not associate probabilities with specific outcomes. For each problem they seek estimation algorithms that perform  well in practice and have provable optimality properties such as small Kullback-Leibler divergence and other metrics between the underlying and estimated distributions. The problems they address are both theoretical, for example the data size required to estimate the underlying distribution to within a given confidence level, and computational, regarding the complexity and sequentiality of the derived algorithms.<br/><br/>

The mechanism of ion formation for a wide variety of molecular species is not known.

Girshick<br/>Institution: University of Minnesota, Twin Cities<br/>Proposal Title: NIRT: Manufacturing with Nanoparticle Sprays and Beams<br/><br/>Technologies that integrate the synthesis of nanoparticles and their controlled deposition onto surfaces will likely play an important role in the development of nanoparticle-based manu-facturing. An integrated program of research and education is proposed that will lead to a fun-damental toolkit for manufacturing with nanoparticle sprays and focused beams. Nanoparticle sprays, in tandem with a high-rate nanoparticle synthesis process, can be used to coat relatively large areas with nanoparticles. Focused nanoparticle beams, in concert with standard microfab-rication techniques, can be used to deposit lines or patterns, or to build three-dimensional ob-jects, made out of nanoparticles.<br/>Processes will be developed in which materials and devices with different nanoparticle-based functionalities are manufactured using nanoparticle sprays and/or beams. This will be demonstrated by considering two different properties of nanoparticle-based systems: superhard-ness and photoluminescence. The long-term objective is to develop enabling technologies in which multiple nanoparticle-based functionalities could be integrated on a common platform.<br/>Fundamental toolkit refers to the set of technologies that will be needed to synthesize and to deposit nanoparticles by sprays and focused beams, so as to create useful structures that ex-ploit specific properties of nanophase materials. The development of this toolkit will, in turn, require that key scientific and technical issues are addressed. These include fundamental under-standing of the interaction between impacting nanoparticles and surfaces; the mechanical behav-ior of nanoparticles and nanoparticulate structures; extending the performance of aerodynamic lenses to smaller particle sizes and narrower beam widths; and accomplishing gas-phase doping of luminescent nanoparticles.<br/>The proposed research will serve as a springboard for a number of education and outreach activities. These include K-12 outreach through a local public school district; outreach to the general public in collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota; training of five graduate student research assistants in a highly interdisciplinary research environment; teaching of new interdisciplinary graduate courses on nanoparticle science and engineering; fostering greater in-volvement of women and underrepresented groups in our graduate research programs; and play-ing a leadership role in promoting nanotechnology activities in professional societies and gov-ernment agencies. <br/>This NIRT project is co-funded by the Combustion and Plasma Systems and Nanomanufac-turing programs.

This project focuses on the development of new quantum algorithms for problems such as Graph Isomorphism, for which there is no known efficient algorithm on classical computers. We focus on the Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) and its relatives. The HSP framework made its first appearance in the seminal work of Simon and Shor, where it led to efficient quantum algorithms for several basic problems in computational number theory, including integer factoring and computing discrete logarithms. In particular, Shor's algorithm for the HSP on the cyclic group makes it possible to break the RSA public-key cryptosystem.<br/><br/>The hidden subgroup problems appearing in Simon's and Shor's algorithms take place over commutative groups, a case of the HSP that is now well-understood. The noncommutative hidden subgroup problem is intimately linked to several problems of major interest, including Graph Isomorphism, hidden shift problems, and cryptographically important cases of the Shortest Lattice Vector problem. Despite these incentives, however, the noncommutative HSP has largely resisted the quantum computing community's advances thus far. Efficient algorithms are only known for a few families of groups, and even the information--theoretic aspects of the problem are poorly understood. <br/><br/>This project will seek both efficient quantum algorithms and query-complexity lower bounds for the symmetric group---the case of the HSP relevant to Graph Isomorphism---and other groups of algorithmic interest. Our approach applies the rich mathematical tools of representation theory, adapted bases, and entangled measurements over multiple coset states.

Yet despite this fascination with kinship, a fundamental mystery has been neglected: Do people adopt kinship practices that serve the interests of their genes? Or does culture define kinship practices causing genetic underpinnings to become obscured? This study will explore the congruence between the cultural and genetic spheres of kinship and, in so doing, shed light on the broader relationship between biology and culture. It is a collaborative venture that combines the expertise of a human population geneticist with that of an anthropologist. This interdisciplinary research will introduce state of the art molecular technology to ethnographic field studies and provide a rich ethnographic data set to permit new questions to be asked using genetic sequence data. The study focuses on the Dogon, a traditional millet farming people of Mali, West Africa. The Dogon are ideal for this research because they employ a variety of cultural practices that appear to be reproductively motivated. This research will test the hypothesis that these cultural rules serve the genetic interests of those who enforce them and that they lead to a close mapping of culture onto biology. The study will also test alternative hypotheses about the basis for human cooperation. This objective is significant because it will be one of the first analyses of helping behavior in a human population that uses data on genetic relatedness from DNA sequencing. <br/>The broader impacts of the study include the training of American and Malian students in genetic techniques and quantitative fieldwork methods. Medical residents will gain experience in a developing country and share their expertise with a rural African health facility. The results will be disseminated in scientific journals, genetic databases, and a specialized monograph.

The proposed project is devoted to the study of feedback control of pattern-forming systems on the basis of most generic nonlinear evolution equations that can be applied to a large class of various systems in physics, chemistry and biology. Specifically, the research will be focused on the following aspects: (i) feedback control of subcritical instabilities in monotonically and oscillatory unstable systems; (ii) feedback control of selection of stationary and wave patterns; (iii) feedback control of nonlinear dynamics in unstable systems with Goldstone mode; (iv) feedback control of nonlinear dynamics in non-variational systems; (v) feedback control of driven phase-separating systems.<br/><br/>In many areas of science and technology - materials science, chemical and biological engineering, nanotechnology, biology and medicine - self-assembly of regular spatio-temporal patterns and structures is observed. This phenomenon provides an efficient and inexpensive route for creating new types of devices and technologies. It is very important to be able to control self-organization processes in pattern forming systems. A promising way to do that is to apply a feedback control by which the desired structure or behavior is achieved by appropriately adjusting the system parameters in real time according to the observed system characteristics. The proposed project is devoted to the investigation of feedback control of self-organization in most generic pattern-forming systems. The results of this research will therefore be applicable to a large variety of systems in physics, chemistry and biology, and will allow to determine the most efficient ways to control self-assembly processes in many new technologies.

0500270	Nonlinear Second-Order PDE in Infinite Dimensional Spaces and Optimal Control of Stochastic PDE	DMS	ANALYSIS PROGRAM	07/15/2005	07/06/2005	Andrzej Swiech	GA	Georgia Tech Research Corporation	Standard Grant	Joe W. Jenkins	06/30/2008	$77,999.00		swiech@math.gatech.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	Atlanta	GA	303320420	4048944819	MPS	1281	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Nonlinear Second-order PDE in infinite dimensional spaces <br/>and optimal control of Stochastic PDE. <br/><br/>Andrzej Swiech<br/>Georgia Institute of Technology<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>The project concentrates on fully nonlinear second-order partial differential equations (PDE) in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. This is a relatively new area which has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Primary examples of such equations are equations of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) type that are associated with optimal control of stochastic PDE. Linear, so called Kolmogorov equations, that give an analytic description of infinite dimensional diffusions, also fall into this category and have been studied intensively, primarily in connection with equations coming from mathematical physics, fluid dynamics, option pricing, and population biology. The research of the project will focus on several fundamental issues related to the general theory of viscosity solutions in Hilbert spaces, together with applications and the study of some particularly important equations. The general questions include the development of tools like Perron's method, the method of half-relaxed limits, finite dimensional approximations, and the development of a viscosity solution theory for Kolmogorov and HJB equations associated with three dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. Applications will include optimal control of stochastic PDE (including stochastic NS equations), large deviations, and mathematical economics and finance. The research on HJB equations associated with stochastic NS equations may help answer some open questions about three dimensional stochastic NS equations themselves. Moreover fully nonlinear integro-PDE in Hilbert spaces that are connected to the emerging field of infinite dimensional jump-diffusion processes will also be investigated. This research will include the study of infinite dimensional integro-Black-Scholes and integro-Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equations related to option pricing in the jump diffusion version of the Musiela model of forward rates. Finally questions related to viscosity solutions of finite dimensional fully nonlinear stochastic PDE will be studied.<br/><br/>Understanding the theory of second-order PDE in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces is the first step in the development of the dynamic programming approach to optimal control of systems governed by stochastic PDE. This project contains a program of research that focuses on the development of new basic tools for such equations. It spans areas as diverse as partial differential equations, functional analysis and operator theory, probability, stochastic processes, stochastic PDE, mathematical finance, and control theory. The research will have significant impact on several areas of mathematics outside the field of nonlinear PDE like optimal control of stochastic PDE, large deviations, stochastic NS equations, and mathematical finance. Moreover it has a potential to stimulate research in related fields like engineering, atmospheric sciences, finance, and<br/>economics, in particular in fluid dynamics, and the theory of bondmarkets. It should also help attract and train graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is an important tool to study the biodiversity of microbes, including protists (algae and protozoa), bacteria and viruses, in the marine environment. Both the morphology and the chemical composition of cell surface features, such as scales, cell wall components, cysts, mineral accretions) may provide characters that identify species. These features may help us discover how microbes interact with other organisms in the sea. They may also help us discover whether microparticles that contribute to ocean chemical fluxes, especially of carbon, have come from microbes, and if so from which ones. Often, the structures of interest are so small than most SEM instruments cannot provide clear images of them. Field-emission SEM has the resolving power to visualize these structure with the detail that we require, and can tell us with greater accuracy of what they are made.<br/><br/>Educational activities include the development of a course on electron microscopy and its application to marine biological research, to be developed as part of Bigelow Laboratory's Foundations of Marine Science course series, and to be targeted particularly for Maine researchers and educators. Images from the SEM will also be incorporated into the Phytopia series of multimedia tools, intended for classroom use at Grade 7 and above and so used by numerous educators in the United States and throughout the world.<br/><br/>Acquisition of the field-emission SEM will provide scientists at the Bigelow Laboratory with a greater range and depth of research opportunities, permitting expansion into areas previously out of reach for lack of appropriate instrumentation. The acquisition will promote greater use of Bigelow Laboratory facilities, especially the Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton, by junior and senior visiting scientists. It will promote the development of educational programs and tools related to electron microscopy, through the Phytopia project series and other Bigelow Laboratory educational and outreach activities.
0513768	Collaborative Research: The CrystalGrid Framework	IIS	ITR-INFORMATION INTEGRATION	09/01/2005	03/20/2008	Donald McMullen	IN	Indiana University	Standard Grant	Sylvia J. Spengler	10/31/2010	$426,689.00	Randall Bramley	mcmullen@tamu.edu	509 E 3RD ST	Bloomington	IN	474013654	8128550516	CSE	7373	9216, HPCC	$0.00	The CrystalGrid Framework (CGF) project will research the acquisition, transport, and curation of data over the entire data space of the field of X-ray crystallography, addressing methods for managing wide heterogeneity in data representations, formats, data containers, administrative domains and diverse instruments and equipment. Until recently, individual labs have simply imposed local homogeneity of format and procedure, and not stored lab-dependent metadata. This ad hoc system is limited, however, as crystallographers begin to cross between labs to accomplish their research objectives, and as increasing numbers and sizes of output data streams leave less time for each investigation. Local workflow must be made explicit, procedures must be formally described, and the history and assemblages of data expressed in an open, shareable way. Creation and management of complete, accessible records for each experiment is critical, as well as heterogeneity in data acquisition and management across the field. <br/><br/>To meet that need, this project will develop a framework of web service interfaces and data and metadata systems addressing the whole spectrum of crystallography. Project participants and collaborators will leverage existing projects, such as Reciprocal Net and Common Instrument Middleware Architecture, that address narrower issues in the problem domain. The CGF will also draw on collaborating projects with overlapping areas of interest, such as the UK-based Comb-e-Chem project. The resulting framework will be a useful environment for crystallographic investigations and an extensible platform on which new web-based applications can be built.<br/><br/>The CGF project involves the classic problem of dealing with heterogeneity in data, procedures, and instruments in the crystallography application space, and another classic problem in integrating the entire data collection, transport, and curation requirements of the domain into a seamless beginning to end system. The challenge is to create a virtualization system that manages heterogeneity in more than a single aspect and to provide vertical integration using only open, extensible, and interoperable standards and methodologies.<br/><br/>While the project constitutes research into pertinent computer science problems, the plan for performing the research is centered on producing a product (the CGF) that will immediately be useful in addressing emerging technical problems in the field of X-ray crystallography. Within crystallography, one of the specific goals is to make structural results accessible that might otherwise never be seen, and so the CGF will help increase the body of scientific knowledge and improve the return on federal investment in the large numbers of x-ray diffractometers and associated instruments nationwide. Although the project targets specifically a few hundreds of crystallography labs worldwide, the software and methods created in it are intended to be reusable for any science moving from individual lab practices to a shared, global collaboratory system. In sciences such as high-energy physics and astronomy, the scientists have long shared single, unique, large instruments and had to create shared data management and instrument metadata. CGF is likely to be useful in other scientific disciplines which still use widely-distributed lab-based instruments that now need to be linked in data grids.

This work has two main related themes. The first is extending the technology of approximation algorithms to problems of greater interest to AI and Robotics. These include problems of path planning under uncertainty, clustering, and problems motivated by new challenges in machine learning. For instance, in the context of path planning, the classic Traveling Salesman Problem asks: what is the shortest route to visit all locations of interest in some deterministic environment and return back to the start? But what if we are developing a plan for a robot whose actions may be unreliable and to which unexpected events can occur? In that case, we would want to use a stochastic model of the environment such as in Markov<br/>Decision Processes. Can one develop good approximations to the natural analog of the TSP in such settings? One of the goals of this work is to explore this and several related optimization problems. In a different context, in machine learning there are a number of problems that can be phrased as a form of graph partitioning, but where the graph is embedded in Rn and there is some geometric restriction on the form of cuts allowed.<br/><br/>The second theme of this work is in the other direction, applying techniques from computational learning theory, including online learning and sample-complexity analysis, to the design of algorithms for optimization problems with provable quality guarantees. These include problems in routing, in algorithmic mechanism design, and a number of problems in online optimization.<br/><br/>Other topics in this proposal include the exploring the relation between kernel methods in machine learning and dimensionality reduction, and investigating how online learning techniques can be used to converge to certain game-theoretic equilibria. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is that this research will advance our understanding of important problems in all three areas: approximation algorithms, machine learning, and planning under uncertainty. The broader impact is that by developing connections between these areas, it will bring them closer together, for instance by developing algorithms with good approximation guarantees for models of greater interest to robotics, or algorithms for clustering and graph partitioning problems of greater interest to machine<br/>learning. This will in turn, we hope, allow future work by other researchers in each area to have a greater impact on each of the other areas.

This instrument is extremely versatile and will be used for the detection of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and proteins in a number of different investigations. The goal of this project is to enhance the ability of faculty and students at St. John's University and the College of St. Benedict to perform molecular life science experiments in both collaborative student/faculty research projects and in labs associated with classes.<br/><br/> The instrument is crucial to a number of collaborative student/faculty investigations. These include studies a) of how damage to DNA affects transcription, b) investigation of the role of a particular protein, called phosphatase 1, in the formation and maintenance of blood vessels in the retina, c) studying the structure of short pieces of DNA (oligonucleotides) as well as in studies of the human enzyme called adipocyte acid phosphatase, found in adipose (fat) cells, and d) studies of the metabolic adaptations of a variety of different organisms to changes in growth conditions such as temperature and diet. These projects all address important biological problems of current interest.<br/><br/> This multifunctional imager enhances the undergraduate research capabilities at the College of St. Benedict (CSB), a college for women and St. John's University (SJU), a college for men; two institutions that have a coordinate relationship and share a common curriculum with joint classes and departments. The instrument will be used by faculty and students in the Biology and Chemistry departments for collaborative research, and will be used in at least six undergraduate classes enrolling students with majors in Biology, Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Natural Science. Acquisition of this instrument will strengthen the research infrastructure of these departments by expanding the ability to visualize and analyze nucleic acids and proteins using a wide variety of techniques. In addition, this instrument will help the Biology and Chemistry departments continue to be successful at attracting and graduating women and American multicultural students by increasing the opportunities of students to participate in modern molecular biological research. This instrument will be a resource for the entire central Minnesota region; for example, faculty and students at the nearby St. Cloud State University will also be users of the instrument.
0515007	Mechanisms and effectiveness of predator detection by capuchin monkeys	BCS	ECONOMICS, Biological Anthropology	07/15/2005	05/01/2007	Charles Janson	NY	SUNY at Stony Brook	Continuing grant	Joanna E. Lambert	02/29/2008	$206,000.00		charles.janson@mso.umt.edu	WEST 5510 FRK MEL LIB	Stony Brook	NY	117940001	6316329949	SBE	1320, 1392	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This study is designed to fill in critical gaps in our understanding of primate-predator relationships. One of the most widely quoted reasons that primates live in groups is to reduce the risk of predation. However, some primates that suffer high predation rates nevertheless forage alone or in very small groups. This observation and the predictions of several theoretical models suggest that high predation risk can favor either very small or very large groups. Which outcome occurs depends on 1) the method and effectiveness of detection of the predator by the primate prey in groups of different sizes, and 2) the relative ability of prey and predator to detect each other. Despite many studies of vigilance behavior in primates, there is only fragmentary knowledge for any species on how effective vigilance is in detecting predators, at what average distance detection occurs, and the variables that affect the chance of detection. Even less is known about the hunting behavior and detection ability of the predators of primates.<br/><br/>To measure the important variables that explain group size in animals as a function of predation risk, five different-sized groups of wild brown capuchin monkeys in Argentina will have live (tethered) and model predators placed in their home ranges. Observers will follow individual monkeys and record a set of context variables (individual's sex and age, distance to the 'predator', monkey's height in the forest, direction the monkey is looking, etc.), along with whether or not the monkey detects the predator, as signaled by alarm calls or a sudden prolonged and fixed stare directly at the predator. Each live tethered bird of prey will be video-taped as a group of monkeys approaches; the distance at which it detects the group and whether the detection is by sight or sound will be determined from the video tape and associated verbal commentary. The detail and sample size of observations will improve greatly on prior studies because the use of model and captive predators permits greater control of the detection process, including systematic variation of detection conditions and recording observations both before and after detection occurs. <br/><br/>The results of this study will address an important question about the origins of social living in human ancestors, and thus may help to explain the form of current human societies. The project will also contribute to biodiversity conservation by: 1) continuing the long-term presence of researchers in the study site to discourage poachers, 2) contributing to the long-term database on group demography of this long-lived species, 3) continued monitoring of long-term changes in local ecology due to invasive species and climate change. The research will help train at least one U.S. graduate student, several college undergraduates, and one or more Argentine biologists. Data from this project will be contributed to a large-scale meta-database for animal behavior, to allow easy online access to current and future researchers. Genetic material sampled from the monkey population will be placed in a public biomaterials repository for future access.

This collaborative project uses model rare-earth-alloy systems to understand the dependence of magnetic properties on nanometer-scale structural and chemical disorder. The model systems will be prepared by different fabrication methods and structurally characterized using x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and synchrotron techniques. Atomic-level and macroscopic magnetic measurements will be correlated to specific types of disorder. These results will improve our understanding of the relationship between nanoscale disorder and magnetic properties in more complex materials, thus allowing us to develop improved materials for existing and future applications. This collaborative project involves researchers from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and the University of Northern Iowa, the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. The project provides postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduate students with interdisciplinary training (including the use of facilities at national laboratories) in an area of critical national need. Workshops and summer activities with Upward Bound math & science students, middle and high school teachers, and high-school students will help educate the future workforce about the importance of nanoscale materials.<br/><br/><br/>****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****<br/>Nanoscale inhomogeneity underlies many of the fundamental properties of systems such as colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials and high-Tc superconductors. This collaborative project uses nanostructured rare-earth (RE) systems to investigate the relationship between magnetic properties and atomic-level disorder. In particular, disordered RE Laves-phase materials will be prepared by mechanical milling, inert-gas condensation, and melt spinning. RE Laves-phase materials have magnetic characteristics similar to CMR and high-Tc materials, but are structurally simpler. Disorder (coordination number, mean interatomic distances, and variations in the interatomic distances), will be determined by x-ray diffraction and X-Ray Absorption Fine-Structure Spectroscopy (XAFS). Atomic-level and macroscopic magnetic measurements, including magnetic XAFS, XMCD, and ac and dc magnetization, will be correlated to specific types of disorder. Understanding how extrinsic properties such as coercivity depend on disorder will improve materials such as those used for permanent magnets and information storage. Sample fabrication, DC magnetic measurements, and structural characterization will be done at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, while the University of Northern Iowa will be responsible for ac susceptibility measurements and analysis. The broader impacts of this award include interdisciplinary research training for postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates. Middle and high school teachers and high-school students will be impacted through workshops and summer programs that illustrate the role materials play in society.

The study of fronts is important because they are often the locus of significant weather occurrences (strong temperature changes, strong winds, formation of clouds and precipitation) that present hazards to human activities in midlatitudes. While much has been learned about fronts through observational, theoretical, and numerical modeling work in the past century, the development of certain types of frontal structures are still not clearly understood. In this research, the Principal Investigators will study two aspects of mid-latitude cold fronts: the forward-tilting structure that some lower-tropospheric cold fronts adopt under certain meteorological conditions and in certain geographical areas; and the corrugated narrow rainband structure that many oceanic cold fronts adopt at their leading edge. Specifically, they will test the effects of horizontal contrasts in static stability (and potential vorticity) on the formation of forward-tilting cold fronts; and the relative importance of horizontal shear instability, precipitation microphysics, and trapped gravity waves in organizing the corrugated cellular structure of narrow cold-frontal rainbands.<br/><br/>A natural approach to this problem is to carry out simulations with a numerical model, because it can be used to isolate the essential physical and dynamical processes involved, and outputs can be compared to the many observed cases of the phenomena in question. A combination of both idealized and real-weather simulations offers the greatest chance of success, and that is the approach that will be taken in this study. With idealized simulations, initial and boundary conditions are specified and physics are simplified in order to isolate and understand particular mechanisms and controlling parameters. With real-weather simulations, initial and boundary conditions based on 3 D observational analyses are used to drive simulations with full model physics, to test if the proposed controlling parameters and mechanisms behave as expected in the full complexity of the atmosphere. <br/><br/>The Weather Research and Forecast Model is ideally suited to carry out the research. This mesoscale model is specifically designed to resolve processes on the scale of 1-10 km, and has the unique capability of being configured to perform both idealized and real weather experiments. A variety of simulations will be designed to test the hypothesized processes mentioned above. These will include control simulations of fronts, and tests of sensitivity to parameters that are considered important in controlling the hypothesized mechanisms, such as vertical profiles of shear and stability, horizontal wind shear patterns, microphysical processes and diabatic heating, etc.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Both the forward-tilting structure and the corrugated narrow rainband structure of some lower-tropospheric cold fronts are well documented, but not well understood, phenomena. Several viable hypotheses involving dynamical and cloud microphysical processes have been proposed to explain these phenomena, but the task remains to test them, in order to understand the parameters that will help predict where upward motion, clouds, and precipitation occur and how they are organized. This study will investigate these controlling mechanisms and thereby advance our understanding of these important frontal phenomena. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The phenomena to be studied are of direct importance to weather prediction because they determine where precipitation and hazardous weather occur relative to the surface cold frontal boundary, a feature that tends to draw much attention from weather forecasters. Working toward better understanding and prediction of where and when disruptive weather occurs clearly has direct potential benefits to society.

In this project the PI is conducting investigations of ultrafast dynamical processes in condensed phase systems using novel computational methodology. The work is focusing on the analysis, visualization, and theoretical modeling of complex nonequilibrium dynamics in many-body systems. The aim of the project is to bridge the gap between the massive amounts of atomic-scale information generated in simulations and descriptions of such systems in terms of simple qualitative concepts and quantitative analytical theories. The computational tools that are being developed combine large-scale classical molecular dynamics simulation, novel analysis of microscopic trajectory data using nonstationary time series methodology based on Wigner-Ville and wavelet representations, and the construction of qualitative pictures and quantitative models that caricature the essential dynamical features and can be validated against numerical and laboratory experiments. The computational and theoretical approach is applied to a range of ultrafast many-body physical and chemical processes. These include vibrational relaxation and the coherent nonlinear interaction of nanoscale shock waves and intramolecular degrees of freedom. The proposed work will contribute to the general understanding of nonequilibrium and nonlinear dynamical effects in complex systems by providing both tools for simulation of such processes and an intuitive framework for their interpretation and theoretical modeling.
0513552	SEI (BIO): Integrated analysis of heterogeneous genomic data for accurate prediction of gene function and interactions between proteins	IIS	SCIENCE & ENGINEERING INFORMAT	07/15/2005	07/08/2005	Olga Troyanskaya	NJ	Princeton University	Standard Grant	Sylvia J. Spengler	06/30/2009	$471,442.00	Robert Schapire	ogt@cs.princeton.edu	Off. of Research & Proj. Admin.	Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	CSE	7294	7373, 9216, HPCC	$0.00	ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The objective of the proposed research is to develop a general and robust machine learning system for integrated analysis of high-throughput biological data for the purpose of prediction of gene function and protein-protein interactions. Achieving this goal requires addressing multiple challenges that include data heterogeneity, variable data quality, high noise levels in data, and a paucity of training samples. These challenges have prevented the successful application of traditional machine learning methods to diverse biological data. The research team will leverage diverse bioinformatics, machine learning, and biology expertise of the co-PIs and collaborators to develop accurate and effective approaches optimized for integrated analysis of genomic data. For prediction of protein-protein interactions, this investigation will focus on Bayesian approaches based on successful preliminary research. For gene function prediction, the focus will be on developing novel machine learning methods. These learning methods will use heterogeneous biological data as well as protein-protein interactions predicted by the system. The proposed research will lead to development of a general bioinformatics system that will utilize diverse large-scale biological data, including gene expression microarrays, physical and genetic interactions datasets, sequence and literature data, to produce an accurate map of protein-protein interactions and predictions of function for each of the proteins. This system will address the critical need in genomics to extract accurate biological information from disparate high-throughput<br/>data sources, enabling the first step in accurate and comprehensive study of cellular processes<br/>on a whole-genome level. Additionally, the proposed analysis will provide genomics researchers with quantitative rankings of the relative reliability of high-throughput experimental technologies, thereby providing biologists with data on which high-throughput technologies are more accurate than others. A significant advantage of this plan is that the research team will work closely with biologists to evaluate the predictions and feed the information back into the investigation to further improve the system and the quality of the resulting predictions.<br/><br/>The proposed system will provide predictions that will drive biological experimentation, enabling genome-wide annotation of unknown genes. The system will be publicly available to genomics researchers through its integration with the Saccharomyces Genome Database, a model organism database for yeast, and also via distribution of this integrated framework to other model databases. The interdisciplinary approach of this proposal will further the impact of advanced<br/>computer science on biology and will precipitate further interactions between the two fields, both through research and through interdisciplinary education.

The workshop will be held in Seoul, Korea, in November 2005. The principal investigator is Chittaranjan Ray, of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Hawaii. Korean counterpart is Dr. Kyu-Hong Ahn, principal research scientist in the Water Enviroment and Remediation Center, of the Korean Institute of Science and Technology (KIST). KIST is involved in a pilot riverbank filtration system along the Tancheon River (a tributary of the Han River) that flows through the city of Seoul, where the quality and flow variations in the river water are significant over the year. The workshop participants will brainstorm the feasibility of riverbank filtration under extreme environmental settings and discuss what types of research strategies must be taken to monitor and evaluate the performance of such systems once they are built. <br/><br/>The nine participants from the U.S.,(including one Ph.D. candidate), and six scheduled speakers from Korea show a good balance between senior and more junior investigators, a mix of relevant research specialties, and a good range of institutions in the US and also in Korea. Several Korean graduate students from KIST and Yeungnam University will also attend. <br/><br/>In the decades ahead, usable drinking water is a resource that will become increasingly scarce and valuable in this country, as in the world. The U.S. hydrological community and water resource managers can benefit from the experience of the Korean pilot riverbank filtration system, which can provide data on performance and lessons learned in extreme conditions which may not occur so frequently in the U.S.

The specific goal is a consistent quantification<br/>of the differences among these supernovae (including reliable line identifications) to reveal the<br/>range and distribution of their spectroscopic properties. Of particular interest is whether they form a<br/>continuous spread of sub-types or break down into distinct subgroups. The analysis will be<br/>performed by comparing observed supernovae spectra with the output of a parameterized supernova<br/>spectrum synthesis code (Synow) developed at the University of Oklahoma. Secondary goals<br/>include a similar study of Type Ic supernovae spectra, using Synow to interpret spectra of quasistellar<br/>objects with broad absorption lines, and the further development of the online supernova<br/>spectra/photometry database (SUSPECT).<br/>Support and training of a graduate student is included and undergraduates will aid in the research<br/>effort. The computer program used in the analysis (Synow) will be made available to anyone who<br/>wishes to use it. The development and expansion of the SUSPECT online supernovae database will also<br/>be continued. A significant component of the work to be performed is also consistent with the joint<br/>NSF/NASA/DoE Physics of the Universe strategic plan.

Landsberg<br/>Title: Geometric applications of exterior differential systems<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Dr. Landsberg will work on two projects: the dual defect conjecture<br/>and the classification of Legendrian varieties and contact Fano manifolds.<br/>The second project originates with a question in differential geometry,<br/>the classification of compact quaternionic-Kahler manifolds, which, thanks <br/>to work of LeBrun and Salamon, is essentially equivalent to the <br/>classification of contact Fano manifolds. Inside the tangent space of a <br/>general point of a contact Fano manifold is an immersed Legendrian <br/>variety and knowledge about such varieties is important for the contact <br/>Fano problem. The Salamon conjecture is that all contact Fano manifolds<br/>are homogeneous. <br/>The first project is to show that the dual variety of a <br/>smooth variety of codimension less than half its dimension is a <br/>hypersurface. This question is of importance in algebgraic geometry as <br/>part of the investigations motivated by Hartshornes's conjecture on complete <br/>intersections. The techniques that will be developed to solve this <br/>problem are as important as the problem iself- a combination of exterior <br/>differential systems and representation theory that will be useful for <br/>other problems in geometry and other areas of science such as <br/>computational complexity and algebraic statistics (Baysean networks).<br/><br/>Dr. Landsberg will use techniques from partial differential equations<br/>(more precisely, exterior differential systems) and representation<br/>theory (of simple Lie algebras) to study two problems in geometry<br/>related respectively to dual varieties and contact Fano manifolds. In <br/>addition to the importance of these questions to the mathematical <br/>community, the techniques that will be developed will be applicable to <br/>problems in other fields such as computational complexity and algebraic <br/>statistics (Baysean networks).

The specific process to be considered is micro-hot-embossing. We propose the following tasks: (a) Conduct experiments to characterize the temperature and strain-rate-dependent mechanical behavior of amorphous polymers, e.g., polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polycarbonate (PC), for application to hot-embossing. (b) Formulation of thermo-mechanically-coupled, large-deformation, visco-elastic-plastic constitutive models for amorphous polymers. (c) Development of a finite-element-based simulation and design capability for micro-hot-embossing. (d) Conduct micro-hot-embossing experiments to check the predictive capability of our numerical simulation procedures. <br/><br/> This fundamental study on polymer manufacturing processes at the micro/nano-scale will further the scientific underpinnings of the rapidly emerging industry for the manufacture of microfluidic devices. Such devices are Microsystems, which control the flow of small volumes (nano- or pico-liters) of fluids (gases or liquids) through micro-capillary channels on a ``chip'', which is integrated with computerized analytical instruments. The devices contain active and passive microstructural features that control the flow and mixing of the fluids to produce physical, chemical and microbiological reactions on small volumes of materials, and are beginning to be used in a wide variety of applications: e.g., biochemical assays, capillary electrophoresis, cell counting and sorting, cell growth, detection of biological species, genomics, liquid chromatography, and even computation. The research should also be able to support the development of other key industries, such as polymer-based photonic and nano-optical devices.

The ATE Manufacturing Centers partner with the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) to plan to create regionally-based, institutional-centered career campaigns to change these perceptions. The manufacturing sector of the economy will grow substantially in the next decade and there are already too few workers with sufficient skills. Wages paid to well-educated manufacturing workers are higher than the average of all sectors. The campaign involves regional alliances of centers and industry to develop messages appropriate to their target audience, develop the campaign with identified funding sources, and build a regional delivery infrastructure, including a business plan.

The objective of this research is to explore a novel approach to control the distribution of droplet sizes produced in an electrospray. The approach is to use a controlled dose of electrons to charge the droplets to a point where electrostatic repulsive forces, which tend to break up the droplet, overcome surface tension forces holding the droplet together. By controlling how the droplets are broken up into smaller droplets, one can precisely control the amount of material delivered by the droplet to a surface. Numerical simulations will be used in conjunction with the experiments as a proof-of-concept and will help guide identification of the optimal electron characteristics (current density and energy) for a given initial droplet population to produce the desired change in the size distribution.<br/>An electrospray provides a means of delivering droplets containing precursor materials for subsequent incorporation into an assembled nanostructure. Controlling the composition of nanostructures is one way to tailor their properties to meet the needs of emerging applications in a wide variety of industries. This approach, if successful, will allow the delivery of smaller sized droplets than is possible using the electrospray process alone. The work in this one year exploratory effort will address the feasibility of the concept as well as lay the groundwork for further development of the technique for nanofabrication. The experimental and computational investigations will involve both graduate and undergraduate students as active participants in the development of diagnostics and computational tools. Development of these tools will promote learning through WPI's project-based educational system that requires each undergraduate conduct a technical team-project.

The dream, however, far outstrips the reality: engineering new biological machines, programming cells behaviors, and building new forms of life pose huge technical and conceptual challenges. Our research is designed to make some important first steps, by developing generally-applicable engineering methods for building synthetic gene networks. Implementation of even the most simple circuits in a biological system requires tedious optimization of a large number of poorly-understood parameters, many of which can neither be measured nor easily manipulated. Simulations can sometimes guide optimization, but we believe that biological systems are best optimized using nature's editing strategy, evolution. We believe that a combined approach of rational design based on computational predictions coupled with directed evolution-making mutations in the laboratory and selecting those organisms exhibiting the desired behaviors--will be fundamental to the progress of synthetic biology. We will in effect learn how to 'breed' useful synthetic gene networks, just as we have learned how to breed useful plants and animals.<br/>This approach mimics natural evolution in exploring the vast and complex landscape of functions available to a set of molecules making up an engineered regulatory pathway. Importantly, it circumvents our near-complete ignorance of how a DNA sequence encodes a specific set of biological functions, a detailed understanding that is required for any 'rational' design approach. By introducing random mutations into the DNA and screening for different functions that might be expressed by the mutant circuits, we can identify which functions are possible as well as the ranges of function available to the specific search process (e.g. random point mutation targeted to a specific gene). With further analysis, e.g. sequencing to identify the mutations and biochemical analysis of circuit components, we gain insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the overall function is achieved or modified. <br/>In this project we have three specific aims. The first is to validate a 'selection module' by which we can efficiently evolve components and circuits in the laboratory. This module connects proper circuit function to the ability of cells that express it to survive and grow. Cells with functioning circuits survive and grow; those that have not solved the problem do not. To program complex behaviors, we will also need components that respond to predefined ranges of input parameters with predictable output parameters. Thus our second aim is to use directed evolution to create a range of transcriptional activators based on the well-characterized framework protein, LuxR. Laboratory-evolved LuxR variants will activate gene transcription at different, nonnatural promoter sites on the DNA. Finally, we propose to investigate the range of circuit functions available to a predefined set of components via evolutionary exploration. Specifically, we will evolve a series of 'band detect' circuits that respond to a prespecified range of acyl-HSL concentrations. These circuits will be used to construct synthetic systems that form patterns of gene expression in the solid phase.<br/>Our ultimate goal is to develop a fundamental enabling technology for synthetic biology as well as for developing bio-inspired modes and architectures for computing. We envision that evolved circuits and the synthetic multicellular systems that can be constructed from them will be useful to researchers developing quantitative models of gene regulation, quorum sensing, and other aspects of cellular computing.

Thus, understanding the evolution of microstructures in solids is a fundamental problem in materials science. Simulations in the presence of numerous evolving interfaces pose mathematical and computational challenges, especially in three dimensions. This interdisciplinary research and training program focuses on developing mathematical models and computational techniques to overcome the challenges of computationally studying surface defects in solids and coarsening in solid-solid and solid-liquid systems. The mathematical impacts of the study will include accurate and fast numerical methods for microstructural evolution in three dimensions and for evolution of defects on solid surfaces, using boundary integral methods and incorporating both diffusional and elastic effects. These techniques will be applied to (1) investigate coarsening in solid-solid and solid-liquid systems by performing two- and three-dimensional simulations, and (2) examine step flows (motion of atomic-height steps) on solid surfaces in three dimensions. These investigations will provide insights into materials issues encountered in high-temperature alloys and semiconductor thin film growth. Close collaborations with experimentalists will allow comparisons of the simulation and experimental results. The equations governing the proposed material systems are closely related to a host of mathematical descriptions for pattern formation in moving boundary problems. Therefore, the proposed modeling and computational techniques will have broad applications and will provide new tools for other research areas. Importantly, the proposed program will provide excellent training opportunities for graduate students interested in research at the interface of mathematics, computation, and engineering.

Part of this variation in parasite prevalence is likely due to variation in the host's ability to resist infection. The main focus of this research is to identify factors that maintain variation in resistance to bacterial infection both within and among host populations, using the model system Drosophila melanogaster. Previous work shows that variation exists within Drosophila host populations. Using a combination of organismal and molecular approaches, the researchers extend these efforts by investigating variation across host populations, with the aim of understanding the evolutionary and ecological factors that maintain this variation.<br/><br/>Together, these experiments will address several important questions regarding the evolution of resistance to infection and, more generally, disease dynamics in nature. This work is particularly significant because it addresses the forces maintaining variation in host resistance across broad spatial scales, and will help scientists to further develop Drosophila as a powerful model system to study the genetics of host-parasite interactions in nature. In addition, this research has direct implications for understanding the spread and prevalence of disease in a variety of host species.

It also justifies its limited engagement in such activities by invoking its Articles of Agreement, which oblige it to leave aside political concerns including a country's human rights record. The hypothesis of this project is that internal conflicts within the organizational culture of the World Bank both illuminate and complicate decision-making over the institution's approach to human rights. Through ethnographic and documentary research at the Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C., this dissertation research project in cultural anthropology traces the development of a human rights culture within the organization. It seeks to demonstrate how the Bank objectifies knowledge, generates categories, and adopts policies as mechanisms of authority. This study builds upon previous ethnographic research at the World Bank and at indigenous and human rights non-governmental organizations.<br/><br/> Through a study of the Bank's shift from an economic to a human rights orientation, this research will uncover internal contradictions, to advance a scientific understanding of the impact of transnational processes on legal arenas including the mutually constitutive relations between global institutions, state law, and non-state normative orders. It will also contribute to a growing body of literature on the anthropology of institutions, including the nature and shape of bureaucratic power and the conditions that propel changes in organizational ideologies.<br/><br/> The results of this study will have broader impacts on society by furthering public understanding of the hidden internal operations of the largest development agency on the planet, the World Bank. It will promote meaningful interactions and partnerships between international institutions, advocates, and indigenous peoples, who are historically underrepresented in development decisions affecting them. This study also has implications for how other economic institutions and international organizations are attempting to incorporate human rights norms within their operations. The project will also contribute materially to the education of the student-researcher.

The efforts of this design will enable measurement, analysis and understanding at levels capable of markedly improving the current state of realizable nanoscale processes and structures. In the probe tip design, we focus on the scanning probe microscopy (SPM) mode of magnetic force microscopy (MFM) because of (1) the inherently poor spatial resolution afforded by MFM (currently 20 nm) relative to other SPM modes and (2) the immediate implications to manufacturing the next generation of magnetic recording media at densities at 1 TeraBit/in2 and beyond (currently at 100 GigaBit/in2 commercially). The interdisciplinary effort required to achieve this resolution-increase necessitates the marriage of nanoscale magnetic physics and digital signal processing since the only way to overcome the physically imposed and resolution-limiting long range magnetostatic interactions between the magnetic media and the probe tip is through deconvolution processing. Tips will be manufactured for both perpendicular and longitudinal magnetic recording media. This effort will be supported by a close collaboration with Seagate Technology.<br/><br/>The research consists of designing and manufacturing a probe tip whose sensitivity response is optimally designed for magnetostatic interaction removal by digital deconvolution processing. The design process will iterate between (1) designing a digital filter from which a sensitivity response can be extracted that meets manufacturing constraints and (2) establishing tip geometries that exhibit the desired sensitivity responses. Of all the manufacturable tips, the best ones will satisfy the favorable design and digital deconvolution processing filter properties of invertibility, compact support size, separability and symmetry. The designs will have accounted for the physical manufacturing restrictions of minimum tolerable sensitivity main lobe width, maximum tolerable sensitivity response extent and sampling period allowable by the MFM machine. The manufacturing consists of focused ion beam (FIB) trimming of conventional MFM tips along with additional treating so that the tip's response is most sensitive to the longitudinal or perpendicular media under study. To assess the resolution increase achieved, atomic force microscopy measurements (known to achieve Angstrom level resolution) and others will serve as the comparative basis. Preliminary results by the PIs in tip fabrication and deconvolution processing are indicative of the resolution promise that the proposed tip design methodology holds.<br/><br/>The integrated research and education effort will allow a host of undergraduate and graduate students alike to contribute to the design process since much of the underlying concepts in the design are obtained in senior undergraduate or first semester graduate courses. Three existing courses in our curriculum will serve as the avenue for presenting and reinforcing research-based concepts through carefully planned class projects that benefit different phases of the research. Project and research results will also be incorporated into a web-based applet for DOPT design enabling other students and researchers to experiment with various configurations and trade-offs. Because FIU has one of the largest minority student (B.S. and M.S.) engineering concentrations on the U.S. mainland, and responding to the minority PI's leadership in this work, minority students will be positively impacted.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit lies in the proposed research being a substantial, unique and innovative departure from the current process of designing nanoscale probe tips. The most fundamental and important accomplishment of this work will be to demonstrate that sensors that are inhererently physically limited by convolutionally-based phenomena can be designed in conjuction with deconvolution processing such that these believed limitations are significantly overcome. The 10-fold resolution-increase expected to be achieved results from signal processing corrections to the physically imposed sensor degradations. Because of this, the proposed deconvolution-optimized probe tip promises to allow for rapid technological developments in nanoscale magnetic devices due to the Angstrom level resolution it is expected to achieve.<br/><br/>The broader impacts resulting from this research are that (1) it is believed that this marriage of tip manufacturing and deconvolution processing can be extended to other types of nonmagnetic interactions, such as Van-der-Waals, with analogous benefits and (2) it will act as a catalyst for the commercial magnetic hard disk storage industry to reach the 1 TeraBit/in2 frontier sooner than what might be considered achievable. The broad societal benefits to increasing bit densities to the levels listed are in the production of smaller, lighter weight hard disks and other magnetic memory devices of improved information capacity that would prove useful in portable devices, such as laptop and tablet computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs), and further fuel the push towards ubiquitous use of wireless devices and wireless infrastructure development.<br/><br/>This NER proposal addresses two of the high-risk/high-reward research and education themes that have been identified by NSF: Manufacturing Processes at the Nanoscale and Multi-scale, Multi-phenomena Theory, Modeling and Simulation at the Nanoscale.

Using perturbation methods and numerical simulation, this project aims to better understand the mechanisms by which ventricular arrhythmias are generated and sustained. The transition from tachycardia to fibrillation has been characterized as proceeding through the breakdown of a spiral wave of transmembrane potential into multiple spirals and finally into a spatiotemporally disorganized state. Despite this important connection, many questions about basic properties of spiral waves are as yet unanswered. While most of the analytical work to date has treated it as a homogeneous, isotropic excitable medium, in fact the heart is a highly complicated, heterogeneous physical system with strong anisotropy and nontrivial geometry. On the other hand, numerical simulations of electric potential propagation in the heart using realistic cellular kinetics and geometries remain computationally challenging and difficult to validate. The main thrust of this project is to distinguish the role in the initiation and breakdown of spirals of the passive properties of cardiac tissue as a conducting medium, described as a bidomain (consisting of intra- and extra-cellular domains) with rotating anisotropy, from that of its active properties determined by cardiac cell electrophysiology. This work will proceed on two fronts: (1) extension of the existing body of work on perturbation analyses of scroll waves in isotropic excitable media to include the rotating anisotropy and bidomain description of cardiac tissue; and (2) construction and implementation of a minimally realistic fiber architecture model of the left ventricle for computationally tractable numerical studies. The combined analytical and computational approach makes possible a basic understanding of the role of geometry and fiber architecture in spiral wave propagation and breakup. Further development of both lines of inquiry has the potential to address the role of excitation-contraction coupling. The project will provide a training ground for graduate students in an interdisciplinary area of research, involving analytical techniques, advanced numerical methods and high performance computing.<br/><br/>A better understanding of electrical properties of cardiac tissue and their role in the development of cardiac arrhythmias could lead to clinical treatments and preventative procedures. Insights from analytical and computational studies of both idealized and realistic models of electrical wave propagation in the heart are essential for understanding cardiac arrhythmias at a fundamental level, and for making direct contact with experimental work and clinical experience in this area. The work that will be undertaken in this project can be viewed as a step toward these goals. The nature of the subject and the research tools that will be used provide opportunities for outreach and education, as well as for the general conveyance of the role of the physical and mathematical sciences in biological and biomedical research to the public at large.

Related research questions include an investigation of the specific L/L environments most strongly related to persistence and success for women in STEM, and the examination of the long-term impact of L/L participation on women's persistence in college and in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Living-learning (L/L) programs are one of the most promising interventions in higher education designed to foster success for women in STEM majors. Through mentoring, support, and collaboration, L/L programs are residence hall-based efforts that blend curricular and co-curricular activities that facilitate greater student integration, achievement, and retention.<br/><br/>Until the development of the National Study of Living-Learning Programs (NSLLP), research on L/L program effectiveness was largely limited to single-program assessments on individual college campuses. The 2004 NSLLP includes the responses of nearly 24,000 students representing 34 universities across the United States. Over 1,650 female STEM majors participated in the NSLLP, about half of whom were involved with one of 41 different L/L programs that cater to women in STEM in either single-sex (e.g., the Women in Science & Engineering Program) or co-educational (e.g., the Science, Technology, & Society House) settings. However, because the majority of the NSLLP respondents were first-year students (which is common for L/L participants), it is premature to evaluate the enduring effects of L/L participation on outcomes such as persistence, academic achievement, and student learning.<br/><br/>The proposed research design uses a mixed methods approach: a longitudinal follow-up survey of the women who responded to the NSLLP in 2004; site visits at three to five campuses that are providing high-to-modestly performing STEM related L/L options for women based on data from the 2004 NSLLP; and an expanded data collection with new participating institutions in order to create ongoing trend data on women in STEM.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merits of the Proposed Activity: This study will advance higher education research by identifying the specific college environment factors that facilitate the academic achievement, persistence, and learning outcomes for women in STEM disciplines. In light of prior research focused on personal qualities (e.g., self-efficacy) of women who persist in STEM, this study will contribute to the literature by illuminating how institutional interventions may also facilitate women's success in STEM. Most importantly, the study's findings will be based on a multi-institutional sample, which can provide results of L/L impact across campus contexts that can therefore be generalizable to and replicable at different types of university settings. The research team conducted the initial NSLLP study.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity: On a practical level, this study will help campus officials prioritize limited and strategic resources to those programs with documented benefits for women in STEM. In addition, for those campuses interested in developing effective L/L programs for women in STEM, this study's findings can serve as a blueprint for best models and practices. Finally, from a societal standpoint, this research will help institutions understand how to retain and graduate underrepresented groups in STEM majors.

Cationic cyclopropanation reactions with benzylic and cyclopropylmethyl alcohol derivatives will be investigated, including a detailed study of the stereochemical integrity of the ring closure reaction, with emphasis on the effect of reaction conditions (solvent polarity and leaving group effects). This methodology will be applied in the synthesis of novel cyclopropyl-substituted histone deacetylase inhibitors. The effect of alpha-heteroaromatic substitution on the stereochemical integrity of the cation cyclization process will be investigated, and this chemistry will be applied toward the synthesis of a series of H3 receptor antagonists. The activation and ring closure of allylic alcohols will be investigated, and this chemistry will be applied toward the synthesis of the architecturally complex anti-fungal polyketide ambruticin.<br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Richard E. Taylor of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame. Professor Taylor and his students will devise and develop new methods for the controlled synthesis of organic molecules containing cyclopropane (three-membered ring) units. Such compounds often require special techniques for their synthesis, given the strain present in the three-membered ring, yet form the basis of a number of interesting naturally occurring compounds as well as potential pharmaceutical agents, including therapeutic agents for disorders involving sleep, food intake, thermoregulation, and memory formation. The PI's initial discoveries in this area are already transitioning into the chemical industry, where they are being used to facilitate the discovery of new drug candidates.

Although Zr is considered to be immobile and zircon extremely stable and durable, many recent field studies have identified zircon that was hydrothermally altered or precipitated from hydrothermal fluids. Double-capsule cold seal pressure vessel experiments at 2 kbar will be conducted to 1) identify the conditions under which the zirconium-minerals zircon and baddeleyite are soluble in aqueous fluids, and 2) characterize the partitioning of trace elements including Th and U between zircon, aqueous fluids and granitic melts. Zircon-fluid solubility and partitioning experiments will be conducted at 450-750C and variable fluid pH and oxygen fugacity (fO2), while a parallel set of zircon-melt partitioning experiments will be conducted at 750C and variable fO2. Identification of unique trace element signatures of magmatic and hydrothermal zircons will allow for accurate interpretation of zircon ages. For example, trace element concentrations can be used to identify a zircon as hydrothermal, and solubility systematics can be used to constrain the conditions under which it formed, so that the measured age can be interpreted to date the time of fluid infiltration under specific conditions (temperature, fluid pH, fO2). <br/><br/>In addition to aiding interpretation of hydrothermal zircons and their measured ages, the solubility systematics can be used to assess the viability of zircon and baddeleyite for storage of plutonium. This project will fund the thesis research of one current M.S. student, 2-3 future M.S. or Ph.D. students, and 2-3 undergraduate students. Equipment purchased will be used by a large number of investigators in this and other research projects. The grant will also aid in the development of a new interdisciplinary Environmental Science Ph.D. program in collaboration with the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Vanderbilt.

The U.S. organizers are Dr. John Shroder and Dr. Michael Bishop, Department of Geography and Geology, University of Nebraska, Omaha, Nebraska. The foreign organizers are Dr. Syed Hamidullah, Director, Center of Excellence in Geology, University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan and Dr. Sayed Hsnain, Vice Chancellor, University of Calicut, Kerala, India. The Karakoram Science Project (KSP) Workshop is to engage Himalayan specialists from the USA with Indian, Pakistani, and other Asian counterparts to discuss problems and possibilities associated with the Karakoram Himalaya in a setting conducive to augmentation of science in the region. By establishing cross-border scientific dialog in person, and through electronic and paper means, significant advances in science quality in the region are expected, as well as the building of future continuing cooperative links. A description of the KSP workshop will be submitted to EOS and Geotimes, papers from the workshop will be published in a book, a website will be developed, and follow-up collaborative activities are planned. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: A host of excellent scientific problems exist in the Karakoram Himalaya. The focus will be mainly upon areas in glacier and mass-movement characteristics and evolution, glacier fluctuations, and related natural hazards, together with the GLIMS (Global Land Ice Measurements from Space) Project that is establishing remote sensing and field-based studies of the basic snow, ice, and melt water for Southwest Asia. Topics of particular interest that will enable previously restricted cross-border collaborations will include new remote-sensing studies, production of digital elevation models from the new ASTER and other imagery, geographic information system software writing and transfer, establishment of new ground-based assessment techniques of benchmark glaciers, new educational examples and techniques for the Himalaya about glaciers, melt water, associated natural hazards, shared resources. Some workshop attendees will present their own materials on other geoscience topics. Collectively the participants will bring together significant geoscience expertise for the Western Himalaya and therefore will brainstorm the new ideas and procedures to study the mountain region.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The workshop will host a diverse group of established scientists, as well as new scientists and younger students of both genders, selected on the basis of interest, expertise, diversity, and their plans for future collaboration. The workshop will engage this group of South Asian scientists in meetings with American scientists, which will enable direct discussion of shared problems and possibilities for the Karakoram Himalaya in a completely new fashion. The PIs have decades of research experience in South Asia, and their counterparts in India and Pakistan are senior scientists who have similar lengthy experience in the Himalaya, as well as elite positions in their universities. They are finding the best scientists from their own countries and from China who will attend the Workshop. This project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Earth Sciences.
0516511	Evolution of Reproductive Isolation and Speciation in Neurospora	DEB	POPULATION DYNAMICS	08/01/2005	07/02/2008	John Taylor	CA	University of California-Berkeley	Continuing grant	Nancy J. Huntly	07/31/2010	$699,000.00		jtaylor@berkeley.edu	Sponsored Projects Office	BERKELEY	CA	947045940	5106428109	BIO	1174	9169, EGCH	$0.00	The object of the research is to understand how barriers to hybridization evolve as populations diverge into separate species. This problem will be addressed by studying hybrid crosses between two geographically and genetically isolated populations of Neurospora crassa, a filamentous fungus (mold) that is one of the best studied organisms in biology, and between N. crassa and its close relative N. intermedia. This project has two main goals. The first is to identify and measure the individual components of reproductive isolation operating throughout the sexual pathway, from defects in mating interactions between hybridizing parents to inviability of hybrid offspring. The second goal is to map genetic loci controlling reproductive isolation barriers and to test hypotheses about the evolutionary genetics of reproductive isolation under different biogeographic scenarios. <br/><br/>The evolution of reproductive isolation is a key event in the origin of new species, and it is hoped that this research will add to our scant understanding of a foundational mechanism that promotes biodiversity on Earth. In Neurospora, as in many species, the intensity of reproductive isolation is geographically structured: for a given species pair, hybridizing parents from disparate locations are more interfertile than hybridizing parents from the same location. This observation suggests that baseline reproductive isolation evolving between geographically isolated species is reinforced by natural selection against hybridization when species occur together. The work undertaken here aims to understand the genetic basis of this process.

It will provide experimental and computer-modeling experience to students and high school teachers in the preparation of advanced nanostructured composite materials. The uniqueness of the process that will be applied for the formation of these composites lies in its capacity to prepare extremely fine starting powders, and to consolidate the powders into useful engineering components using lower temperatures and lower pressures. The lower temperatures and pressures prevent exaggerated growth of the powders. Hence, the nanostructured character of the composites can be preserved with beneficial engineering implications. With such a structure, these composite materials are hypothesized to possess unique mechanical properties, which may prove useful in engineering applications, particularly in the aerospace industry, where the need for stronger and lighter composite materials is always present. Through this project, students from the participating institutions will be trained in experimental techniques and computer models that will allow the synthesis and sintering of unique materials. In addition, teachers from a local high school will be involved in research activities and development of lesson plans during the summer at the lead institution.<br/><br/>Technical Details:<br/>The objective of this project is to study the unique synthesis and spark-plasma sintering (SPS) of fully-densified oxide and carbide nanocomposites. The first activity to be undertaken will be the synthesis of nanostructured powders using a reverse micelle process, and the characterization of the process over a wide range of experimental conditions (i.e., temperature of calcination, time of calcination, and water-to-surfactant ratio) in order to optimize and scale-up the process. As a complement to the experimental work, computer models for the synthesis process will be developed that can be used to predict the final shape, particle size, and crystallite size of the powders being prepared. Subsequently, densification of the nanostructured powders via spark-plasma sintering will be undertaken and characterized over a wide range of experimental conditions (i.e., pressure, temperature, and time of densification). The microstructural development during the densification process will be examined carefully to determine grain growth of the nanopowders. The project will distinguish itself from previous experimental studies in three ways: (1) this will be first study that will use ultra-fine oxide and carbide powders (in the 1 - 5 nm range) for sintering via SPS to obtain compacts with grain sizes 30 nm and lower; (2) this will be the first study that will utilize a mesoscopic approach for the development of a computer model of reverse micellar systems, which is of great value for capturing many molecular-type features that are not possible using continuum mechanics approaches or fully atomistic models, the latter due to computational restrictions; and (3) this will be the first study that will characterize fully dense nanostructured compacts with grain sizes below 30 nm, which will allow the determination of mechanical properties in these types of materials.

The approach will be to formulate a rigorous fundamental theory of probabilistic tolerances based on appropriate axioms. Instead of tolerances specified by deterministic intervals, in this approach tolerances will be defined by probability distributions. Axioms will be proposed to delineate the sets of probabilities that can logically be tolerances. Probabilistic tolerances will permit consideration of relations among the various tolerances for a single part. Moreover, consideration will be given to the elucidation of rules for accepting or rejecting entire lots or batches of parts based on measurements for a small random sample. Throughout the research, measurement errors and measurement costs will be considered rigorously. In later stages of this project, applications to nanomanufacturing will be explored.<br/><br/>If successful, this research will provide a foundation for probabilistic tolerances; it will be the first rigorous analysis of probabilistic dimensioning and tolerancing systems. This could potentially revolutionize the way that geometric parts are formally specified. Probabilistic tolerancing can improve the competitiveness of US manufacturing because it permits more cost-effective part fabrication and assembly. Faster and cheaper production is possible when the requirement that every part satisfy a list of fixed deterministic tolerances is replaced by appropriate less rigid but equally functional probabilistic requirements. The costs of rework and discard - and associated environmental effects - will be reduced. Higher product quality will be possible without increased costs. In addition, this project will foster rigorous interdisciplinary research, integrate research and education, and encourage the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.

Activities during the year are centered around several key participants, particularly early career researchers who are making an enormous impact such as Bhargava, Green, Soundararajan and Tao.<br/>In addition there will be extended visits by more than forty active researchers.<br/>This grant will help junior US mathematicians to take advantage of these opportunities.<br/><br/>Number theory, a subject often motivated by the simplest and most basic of questions, is nevertheless breathtaking in its scope of techniques and breadth of applications. Certain number theoretic topics are very exciting at the moment, following some extraordinary recent breakthroughs in the understanding of some fundamental and longstanding questions. This special year in number theory will give more researchers the opportunity not only to learn about these breakthroughs, but to collaborate with a wide array of number theorists from around the globe. Of particular emphasis are the development of a p-adic Langlands correspondence, which will tie together far flung topics in a surprising way, and the further development of additive combinatorics, which has recently led to the proof that there are infinitely many k-term arithmetic progressions of primes,a famous old question. There will also be focus workshops on other topics that the organizers believe are primed for significant advances. One of these areas has seen the proof that there are gaps between primes that are far smaller than the average, another longstanding question. This special year gives U.S. mathematicians, especially young researchers, an unusual opportunity to interact with a large number of the world's leading number theorists, particularly those from Europe and <br/>Asia.

Existing projection techniques often do not preserve structural<br/>properties enjoyed by eigenproblems from various engineering applications, and<br/>therefore the reduced problems do not necessarily reflect their practical<br/>backgrounds in any meaningful ways.

A number of<br/>interesting ideas will be pursued here, including a general framework for carrying<br/>out structural preserving subspace projections, an unifying convergence analysis<br/>for all Krylov subspace type projections that connects moment matching properties<br/>in reduced order modeling and eigenvalue and eigenvector convergence theory, and a<br/>sub-orthogonalization process that will serve as the basis to devise efficient<br/>projections.<br/><br/>Eigenproblems appear ubiquitously all across applied science and engineering,<br/>and their solutions are routinely sought and are critical in one way or another<br/>to various scientific computational tasks. Examples includes computational<br/>problems from structural dynamics, control systems, circuit simulations,<br/>computational electromagnetics and microelectromechanical systems, data mining,<br/>and web search engine design, etc. This investigation shall advance significantly<br/>the underlying engineering applications by making the involved matrix computations<br/>much less expensive, more accurate, and most importantly result in scientific<br/>simulations that reflect better the underlying physics. Graduate students with<br/>emerging expertise in numerical eigenvalue computations will be involved.

0518022	Dynamics in networks of cortical fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons	DMS	MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY	08/01/2005	07/21/2005	Timothy Lewis	CA	University of California-Davis	Standard Grant	Mary Ann Horn	07/31/2009	$150,000.00		tjlewis@ucdavis.edu	OR/Sponsored Programs	Davis	CA	956186134	5307547700	MPS	7334	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons in the cortex play fundamental roles in setting the response threshold and shaping the response of cortical microcircuits. In particular, the temporal structure and the amplitude of population synchrony in the network of FS neurons strongly influence the response of the full cortical microcircuit. However, while pairs of FS neurons in vivo have been shown to frequently fire in synchrony, the extent of synchrony in the population of FS neurons is not known. To understand cortical information processing, we must know how the FS network is behaving and how the cellular properties and connectivity interact to produce this behavior. We will use mathematical modeling to examine the mechanisms that shape the response of networks of inhibitory neurons in the cortex to sensory input, and thus we will provide insight into the role of inhibition in sensory information processing. Both biophysical-detailed and idealized models of the FS neuron network will be constructed, and the dynamics of the network models will be thoroughly examined using data analysis methods, numerical simulations and analytical mathematical techniques. The responses of the model network to biologically-realistic stochastic input will be studied. In particular, the influence of the correlation structure of the input, the intrinsic properties of FS cells and the connectivity within the FS network will be considered. We hypothesize that certain input to the FS network could trigger waves of activity that propagate through the network via the electrical coupling. These waves would be a novel mechanism for significant amplification of the inhibitory response. Conditions for waves in the FS model networks will be investigated and the likelihood of waves occurring in vivo will be assessed. The behavior in the models will be compared to data from in vivo experimental data, and predictions made from the modeling work will be tested in vitro experiments.<br/><br/>A major goal of neuroscience is to understand the mechanisms involved in processing sensory information in the cerebral cortex. This involves understanding how the intrinsic properties of neurons and the connectivity between neurons affect the input-output characteristics of cortical neuronal networks. It is known that inhibitory neurons, such as fast-spiking (FS) neurons, play fundamental roles in determining the response of cortical networks, however the details concerning exactly what they do and how they do it remain unclear. This modeling project will examine the response characteristics of networks of FS neurons and identify the cellular mechanisms underlying these characteristics. Thus, the work will take a step towards understanding the cellular basis of how the brain processes sensory information. The work will be part of a large body of research being done by many neuroscientists that will lead to improved treatments for complex neurological disorders such as epilepsy and attentional disorders.

Spafford<br/><br/>Computing systems, and especially software on critical servers, are constantly becoming more complex. This addition of features has contributed to greater complexity and to the addition of significant, ongoing vulnerabilities. In part, this may be traced to design decisions that have depended upon adding software for new functions rather than adding additional hardware to support greater separation and enhanced security. The falling cost of IT hardware suggests that this latter approach may be more cost-effective for secure system development. <br/><br/>The focus of this research is to investigate the construction of a complex computer server system from simpler, separate computer systems. The effort will explore how to apply well-known (but seldom used) security engineering principles coupled with newer design features to produce highly-secured components. The research will also develop metrics that will allow objective comparison of the vulnerabilities and benefits of the resultant system against more conventional architectures. <br/><br/>The expected outcomes of this project will be: 1) validation or disproval of the value of a number of security engineering techniques; 2) a demonstration prototype of a server that should be more secure against attack than are more conventional systems; 3) an approach to designing objective metrics for measuring server vulnerabilities; 4) materials to enable use of the prototype in educational settings.

Szyld<br/>Temple University<br/><br/>Asynchronous Parallel Methods with Overlap for Google Matrices, Dynamics of Biomolecules, and Other Markov Chains Problems<br/><br/><br/>This project relates to computational problems with singular matrices, and in particular with those representing Markov chains. Two important applications drive this investigation. The first of these are the stochastic matrices representing the interconnections between web pages in the World Wide Web. This representation can be done in several ways, one of which is by the PageRank algorithm reportedly used by Google. A basis for the null space of this matrix, appropriately normalized, gives the ranking of the web pages used by the search engines.<br/>It is proposed to solve such singular linear systems by parallel block iterative methods.<br/>Schwarz methods have been shown to be very effective in the nonsingular case, thanks to the use of overlapping variables. These ideas will be applied to singular systems and Google-type matrices.<br/>One of the computational tools to be developed to that end is a new combinatorial and algebraic algorithm to determine appropriate blocks of variables (with the inclusion of overlapping variables) so that the parallel iterative methods work well.<br/>Asynchronous methods will also be studied in this context. The second important application comes from the dynamics of medium-sized biomolecules, including certain viruses, such as HIV. These molecules have different equilibrium states, and the probability models to go from one state to another give rise to singular matrices. Certain blocks of variables represent metastable configurations of these biomolecules, and<br/>the proposed project involves new algorithms to find these metastable configurations.
0528143	Collaborative Research: Stochastic Sensing Control Models for Safe and Efficient Traffic Signal Strategies	CMMI	CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS	08/01/2005	06/03/2008	Thomas Urbanik II	TN	University of Tennessee Knoxville	Continuing grant	Dennis Wenger	07/31/2009	$35,000.00		turbanik@utk.edu	1 CIRCLE PARK	KNOXVILLE	TN	379960003	8659743466	ENG	1631	1057, 9150, CVIS	$0.00	Abstract for CMS-0528225 and CMS-0528143<br/><br/>Over the past decade, the ability to obtain detailed, reliable and time-dependent traffic flow data has tended to mostly emphasize strategic level control algorithms for large systems of controllers in the real-time traffic control context. These algorithms are typically targeted at large urban areas and depend on rather extensive and costly detector placements. They do not cost-effectively address isolated intersections in semi-urban or rural areas, where either extensive system-wide detector installation cannot be economically justified, or signalized intersections are spatially sparse precluding a systems perspective. The investigator and his colleagues develop a range of tactical stochastic sensing control models that enhance the safety and efficiency at signalized intersections. They use a probabilistic paradigm that is consistent with state-of-the-art technological capabilities of existing signals, is sensitive to user requirements, and captures the time-dependency and randomness. This new paradigm is incorporated in a probabilistic control layer that works within the existing traffic control framework. It explicitly acknowledges that the arrival process of vehicles to a traffic intersection is stochastic in several respects, representing a shift from the current standard practice of signal control logic where this randomness is implicitly incorporated to some extent through actuated control. However, the current actuated logic is methodologically limited in capturing the vagaries of vehicle headways under multiple lanes, the influence of weather, the effect of vehicle arrivals on the competing phases, as well as in exploiting the rich array of readily-available historical data. It also lacks a robust mechanism to safely terminate the green by ensuring dilemma zone protection. The proposed methodology for signal control logic: (i) is probabilistic to reflect the multiple facets of randomness associated with the operation of signalized intersections, (ii) can exploit valuable historical data in addition to the current conditions reflected by real-time data, (iii) can enhance operational robustness through strategic sensor placements, (iv) can incorporate a holistic view of the intersection rather than focusing on just the intersection approaches corresponding to the current phase, (v) is technology-neutral to accommodate a variety of sensing technologies, and (vi) can react to inclement weather conditions and special events. The study leverages existing state-of-the-art traffic signal laboratory facilities (Purdue University instrumented intersections in West Lafayette and Noblesville, IN as well as the Traffic Operations Laboratory at the University of Tennessee). Rather than just use sensor data passively, the study incorporates data from the instrumented intersections and prototype models and algorithms into actual laboratory-based closed loop signal control systems. This represents a significant technological paradigm for the next generation of sensor-based methodologies that are less tolerant of performance inefficiencies and safety drawbacks for traffic systems. <br/><br/>Our society is continuing to demand safer and more efficient roadways. Traditional traffic signal control uses deterministic algorithms which are reliable, but frequently inefficient in their allocation of green time. As traffic congestion increases, it is necessary to obtain more efficiency out of existing systems. This study reduces delay and improves safety at the widely prevalent rural and suburban isolated intersections by developing new probabilistic paradigms that exploit advances in information and sensor technologies. The proposed approaches incorporate a new control layer that is compatible with control infrastructure, thereby allowing direct implementation of this research without large and expensive upgrades to signal system infrastructure. The study reduces dilemma zone exposure and increases operational efficiency. Reduced dilemma zone exposure reduces human factors related crashes. More efficient operations reduce fossil fuel consumption and vehicle emissions. The proposed solutions are a paradigm shift compared to methodological constructs adopted for the past four decades, and are synergistically enabled by the rich array of data afforded by advances in sensor and information technologies. The study also contributes to current efforts on developing a national network of traffic signal control laboratories that leverage capabilities at geographically distributed universities.

However, it is currently unknown which regions of the pan-Arctic are most vulnerable to future changes. In order to begin to address the future change to freshwater availability on a pan-arctic scale, this team will use a system of arctic typologies to enable the integration of biophysical data with socio-cultural data produced regionally, such as demographics and water values. They will use mature data sets to study the strategic transformations of the high latitude water cycle.<br/><br/>Recent studies suggest that climate change will have a significant impact on arctic hydrology. Changes in the hydrologic cycle will affect both the presence of surface water and the thermal balance in soil. While preliminary evidence suggests a changing climate will have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle in arctic regions, very little evidence is available to predict how the quantity of freshwater used by people is likely to change. Even less is understood about how hydrologic changes will affect the sustainability and culture of arctic residents.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this research is to use a wide array of existing data sets in a synthesis effort to describe the vital role of freshwater in the lives of people in the pan-Arctic, how it has changed in the recent past, and how it is likely to change in the future. The group will use a model to predict climate-induced changes in the hydrologic cycle and the resultant water stress on people at these high latitudes. Water-related stress will involve all of the key agents of change: climate change, land use/cover change, and water management by humans. They seek to address water stress in the pan-Arctic by testing hypotheses related to the 1) dominant types of hydrologic change at local, regional and continental scales, 2) the interplay between humans and hydrology over the pan-Arctic, and 3) future prognostication of the high latitude water cycle under changing climate and populations. An important component of this research is an attempt to bridge the gap between large, continental scale processes with those processes acting at local scales.

This proposal seeks to use a model system (the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus) to untangle the initial phases of diversification. Genetically differentiated populations of this copepod species can be crossed and studied in the laboratory to gain insights into the genetic factors that cause reproductive isolation between them. In this system reproductive isolation is only partial between populations (i.e. speciation is not yet complete). These copepods therefore allow investigation of the earliest stages of speciation, providing a useful contrast to studies in other systems in which there is complete reproductive isolation. One specific genetic system that will be examined is the mitochondrial electron transport system, which is responsible for energy generation in eukaryotes. Interactions between genes in this system appear to result in low hybrid fitness, forming part of the basis for reproductive isolation in these copepods.<br/><br/>The significance of the proposed work is two-fold. First, an understanding of the genetic basis of reproductive isolation in this system will help to illuminate the process of speciation in animal taxa. Second, a specific focus on the interacting genes in the electron transport system could yield insights into adaptive changes involving mitochondrial energetics. The proposed research will include both graduate and undergraduate training and will involve both underrepresented minorities and women in the research process.  <br/>

The Moss Flora of Central America is a revisionary flora, that is to say a rigorous scientific account of the 921 moss species found in Central America, analyzed from field, herbarium, and literature sources. This fourth part is the final section of the flora. The Moss Flora of Central America is based upon the study of historical collections held in major U.S. herbaria as well as recent collections made by the author and colleagues. It authenticates modern species names, while accounting for older non-valid names, gives detailed descriptions of each plant's form, an account of the habitat and ecology of each species, provides the distribution of the species both within Central America and world-wide, and presents detailed discussions of the unique features of each species as well as the best ways of distinguishing species from each other. Differences between moss species are often difficult to discern, and so each species in the flora is illustrated with a full page of line drawings. Also, lists of all previous illustrations of the species are given. Publication of the Moss Flora of Central America is in English, with the text of the flora and accompanying specimen databases also available on the web. The flora is available in Spanish, and this version of the flora can also be accessed on the web. <br/> The Moss Flora of Central America will stimulate the study of mosses throughout the Neotropics by providing in a single reference (in English and Spanish) diagnostic keys and descriptions to all the mosses in the region. It will involve the naming of large numbers of un-named collections that have accumulated in herbaria over the last twenty-five years. These collections, as well as duplicate material that will be widely distributed, will form the basis of a primary reference collection that will greatly enhance the ability of scientists to recognize species throughout the Neotropics. This will allow mosses to be meaningfully incorporated into many other interdisciplinary studies, most notably ecological studies. Furthermore, this assessment of Central American mosses can also be used to support or criticize studies done with other forms of plants or even animals in the region. Mosses occupy microhabitats that are extremely sensitive to changing physical conditions. In this time of suspected global warming and the uncertain impact of global climatic changes on world ecosystems, the Moss Flora of Central America will provide critical baseline bio-data from a crucial and ecologically sensitive part of the world. This baseline data in conjunction with future studies on the mosses of Central America will be useful in assessing the effects of climatic changes in this critical region of the world.

There has been much recent interest and controversy over how elaborated sexual display traits evolve. In this study the hypothesis that mate choice is much more complex than is commonly suggested will be evaluated. This information will then be used for evaluating competing sexual selection hypotheses that may describe the evolution of elaborate male sexual display. This work will be carried out in a field study of the satin bowerbird, a species that has one of the most ornate male sexual displays of any species, has served as an important model species for studying sexual display, and for which the study population has been monitored since 1980. The existing highly detailed information on individual female mate searching and courtship patterns at bowers over multiple years provides unique information for testing sexual selection hypotheses. The focus of this proposal is on the potential importance of male spatial modulation of courtship display and its role in a highly complex mate selection system. Also, an ongoing study of mate searching will be extended and information on genetic relatedness of individuals in this study population will be added. This work should provide new information on courtship communication and how males modulate courtship, how relatedness affects mate choice and mate searching by females and extend our information on the lifetime mate searching histories of individuals females. The intellectual merit of this proposal results from the opportunity to explore complex male display and understand what mechanisms of sexual selection drive the evolution of these highly elaborated male display traits. Novel tests of hypotheses about the role of relatedness in mate choice will be developed. This work will further our goal of following mate choice patterns of female satin bowerbirds through their lifetime. Broader impacts of this research include the opportunity to train undergraduates, graduate students, and volunteers in the field and lab in which a high proportion of females and underrepresented minorities participate. This work on mate choice in bowerbirds has resulted in publication in top journals including two recent scientific articles in Nature and has drawn much attention from the media including two write ups in Nature, one in Science and articles in National Geographic Magazine and the NY Times.

Experimental methods involve infrared pulsed laser depletion spectroscopy of molecules and molecular clusters in helium droplets, and CARS spectroscopy of neat hydrogen clusters. The ultimate goal of this research is to uncover how the properties of a superfluid evolve upon reducing the dimension of a system from bulk to small droplets, which may contain from several thousand to a few tens of helium atoms or hydrogen molecules. Spectroscopic studies will address the question of what the macroscopic concept of superfluid and non-superfluid fractions of liquid helium in the vicinity of a molecule means in terms of the quantum mechanical interaction of the molecule and its helium solvation shell. As well, new knowledge of the structure and quantum states of helium and hydrogen clusters and their interaction with molecules have the potential to make a valuable contribution to molecular spectroscopy, for which fluxional clusters present a considerable challenge at present.<br/><br/>Superfluids are able to flow endlessly without friction. Hydrogen clusters, because they are made up of molecules, can be examined for superfluidity without the need for doping by other molecules as is required for atomic fluid helium droplets. This project aims to address a number of long-standing and intriguing issues, such as learning to detect superfluidity in microscopic droplets, discovering what it means for a cluster to exhibit superfluid behavior, and determining how many atoms/molecules are needed for a fluid to become superfluid.

The work is motivated by the fact that although the use of metal-oxy/nitride/carbon hard coatings is well-established for application to tool materials, much less progress has been made on efficient wear-coating systems for use in machine components. The functionality of machine parts often dictates the use of soft and compliant materials such as Mg, Ti, Zn, Al, Cu, Ag, or Au. These all have poor elastic/plastic support properties, and entail large compliance and CTE mismatches to potential hard coating materials. Transformational superelasticity is an isothermal form of the shape-memory effect. It is what gives NiTi eyeglass frames ('Flexon') their extremely high resilience. Applied as vacuum-deposited thermo-functional interlayers, NiTi thin films increase resilience, accommodate large mismatch strains, moderate contact stresses, reduce friction, and limit damage accumulation during large, high-cycle strain reversals in both processing and service. Some of the same mechanisms also limit the interfacial stresses that degrade adhesion, potentially allowing use of much thicker hard coatings (>10 microns) than has previously been thought possible. <br/><br/>Measurements of tribological response by dry sliding wear, bend adhesion, scratch loading, and nanoindentation are being made under conditions of constant surface-chemistry and contact morphology. CrN, which is a low-cost coating having medium-high hardness, high stiffness, and very low thermal expansion, is being used as a model material for sliding contact against a hardened carbide ball. Aluminum alloy 6061-T6 is being used as a model substrate material. Experimental variables are the relative NiTiX/CrN layer thicknesses and topography, interlayer processing, load, and temperature. Tribological probes are augmented by many other techniques. Their various mechanical and tribological properties will be investigated. The solid mechanics thrust is focused on numerical modeling of interfacial shear, bearing, and compatibility stresses resulting from both processing and sliding contact loading. The emphasis is on predicting plastic strains in the substrate and strain distributions in the superelastic interlayer. <br/><br/>The educational component involves undergraduates in the proposed work via summer internships and independent study projects. This continues our historically successful efforts to (1) challenge students from diverse groups with hands-on research, and (2) provide opportunity for advanced undergraduates to contribute to the literature, and to become competitive for NSF graduate research fellowships.
0518264	The Effect of Dialect Experience on the Perception of Regional American Vowel Variation: Identification, Discrimination and Sociolinguistic Norms	BCS	LINGUISTICS	09/01/2005	12/06/2007	Valerie Fridland	NV	Board of Regents, NSHE, obo University of Nevada, Reno	Standard Grant	Joan Maling	02/28/2009	$92,193.00		fridland@unr.edu	1664 North Virginia Street	Reno	NV	895570001	7757844040	SBE	1311	0000, 9150, 9251, OTHR	$0.00	With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Valerie Fridland will conduct eighteen months of linguistic research investigating how vowel perception is affected by dialect experience. In the past decade, sociolinguists have provided descriptive accounts of low level phonetic changes that are affecting the vowel systems of speakers in various regions of the U.S. Some of these changes are creating greater convergence in regional vowel production, but many are actually contributing to greater divergence. African-American groups in the U.S. appear to have only limited participation in many of these shifts, which are predominately associated with European-American speech. While such research illuminates how vowel sounds are produced across the country, little is known about how such changes are perceived by speakers within and among regions and ethnic groups. In addition, the impact of such changes on cross-dialectal intelligibility has not been explored. Building on previously supported research and groundwork laid by experimental speech perception research, this project examines how speech perception is shaped by both social and linguistic experience, addressing questions of change across the lifespan and the impact of social and regional variation on perception. To gain a better understanding of the impact such productive changes have on how we hear and understand speech, this research will investigate how shifts in vowel production shape speakers' recognition of phonetic and phonemic boundaries and whether such divergent trends across dialects and ethnic groups lead to greater cross-dialect confusion. Through the combination of instrumentally-synthesized perception tests, production data and cross-dialect comparison, the study hopes to gain insight into some of the prevailing claims about the origins and diffusion of sound change and the fluidity of perception and production across the lifespan.<br/><br/>Research in these areas should have both theoretical and applied benefits, from contributing to basic theories about the nature of sound change to the discussion surrounding the growth of national education standards for curricula and testing, the ability of adult language learners to adjust aspects of their phonological system, and issues of cross-dialectal comprehension in the development of educational materials. <br/>Beyond the educational sphere, comparative examination of both the productive and perceptual range of speakers affected by different regional and ethnic dialect experience can assist in the development of computer-based voice technology. Difficulties faced in the wide application of speech production and voice recognition software need not be insurmountable if research can calibrate productive and perceptual differences among major regional and social groups across the U.S.

The molecular processes that result in the formation and evolution of ambient nanoparticles must be probed to provide an improved understanding of the role of these particles in the environment. Such studies are complicated by the inhomogeneity in spatial and temporal occurrences of particle formation and their rapid growth rates under typical ambient conditions. The techniques that are currently available for nanoparticle measurements are, however, largely inadequate for these studies.<br/><br/>Based on the need for accurate characterization of nanoaerosol processes, the overall objective of this research project is to design and develop instrumentation that can enable in-situ, real-time, and high-resolution measurements of nanoparticle size distributions and provide compositional characterization. Ambient measurements with these instruments will be used in conjunction with laboratory experiments and modeling, to greatly advance our understanding of nanoscale processes in the environment.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit:<br/><br/>This proposal is motivated by an immediate requirement for real-time, high-resolution<br/>nanoparticle physical and chemical characterization. For such measurements, this proposal introduces two new and innovative nanoparticle characterization techniques.<br/><br/>1) A unique classifier design that will enable high-resolution nanoparticle size distribution measurements with a large aerosol sampling rate; and 2) A new volatility response spectrometer for fast particle composition measurements at rates ~ an order of magnitude faster than currently possible. <br/><br/>Field measurements with these instruments in combination with aerosol microphysical modeling will advance our understanding of environmental nanoparticles and their processes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>In addition to the development of new instruments for atmospheric nanoparticle characteristics, this proposal will establish a new fast tandem differential mobility technique that can be extended for other measurements such as aerosol hygroscopicity. Epidemiology studies with data from the proposed instruments will be critical to determine any link between exposure to source-classified ambient nanoparticles and human health.<br/><br/>As a part of this project, a post-doctoral scholar and an undergraduate student researcher will be recruited. We hope to involve researchers from underrepresented groups by coordinating our recruitment through Clarkson's minority programs and with personal recruiting effort at Southern University, Baton Rouge, LA. The results and instrument designs will be presented in conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.<br/><br/>In summary, the fields of nanoparticle science and the environment will be greatly advanced with the improved knowledge of these particles and their processes. Their measurements at high resolution and accuracy will provide critical data for policy makers and scientists to study the complex nanoparticle-atmospheric interactions and assess nano-aerosol contributions to environmental changes or human health effects.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses the research theme 'Nanoscale processes in the environment'.

The main feature of this new class of models is their ability to isolate and detect in natural scenes target objects that are obstructed by noise, textures, or other occluding objects, without generating erroneous or misleading features in the process. The identification and/or development of false object boundaries has long been a challenge for edge-preserving image processing models; this project seeks to find a universal approach for solving this problem. These new models are based on variational methods and partial differential equations. The investigator will establish their mathematical validity, determine properties of their solutions, develop efficient and accurate numerical schemes for their implementation, and directly apply these models to solve critical problems in the sciences and engineering.<br/><br/>Through existing collaborations with researchers in medical imaging, materials science, geology, pharmaceuticals, and optical character recognition, the investigator and undergraduate students will use these new models to solve key issues in science and technology. These problems include removing noise while isolating key medical features in highly degraded magnetic resonance images, identifying and analyzing the grain structure of nanoscale materials for optimizing high technology metals, and identifying land cover regions that are at high risk for hazards such as wildfires or flooding in remotely sensed images where the boundaries of these regions are obstructed by textures such as roads or topography. Currently, the only reliable methods for treating each of these problems depend on hand-drawn object boundaries. This is prohibitively time consuming on large data sets, so automating the boundary detection process will greatly enhance the state of the art. False object detection can be devastating in any one of these applications, so existing automated methods cannot be directly applied. This project seeks to find theoretically sound approaches that avoid this drawback while removing obstructions and accurately identifying target objects.

Suarez<br/>University of California, Santa Barbara<br/><br/>Because of their small size and energetically expensive mode of flight, hummingbirds display some of the highest known metabolic rates among vertebrate animals. Low ambient temperatures further increase thermoregulatory costs and, therefore, increase the rate of food intake. Flying to forage requires even higher rates of energy expenditure, so how do hummingbirds make ends meet and how do they make an energetic profit to enable pre-migratory fattening? Although hummingbirds rely on fat to fuel migratory flight, previous studies on rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) revealed that short foraging bouts are fueled by carbohydrate. This allows birds refueling at meadows during migration to deposit fat at higher rates because it avoids the energetic inefficiency that results from synthesizing fat from dietary sugar and then using fat to fuel foraging flight. It is proposed that hummingbirds use fuels optimally to be more energetically efficient foragers. In the studies proposed here, rates of O2 consumption and CO2 production during hover-feeding shall be measured to estimate the energetic cost of hover-feeding as well as to determine the nature of the fuel(s) used. The effects of low ambient temperature shall be determined. The results shall be used to refine a computer model of the energetics of hummingbird foraging to determine how they make a profit under harsh environmental conditions. It is not known whether hummingbird flight muscles are directly fueled by dietary sugar or whether dietary sugar must first be converted into a storage form of carbohydrate. Sugar labeled with stable carbon isotope shall be used to determine the extent to which the flight muscles are fueled directly by dietary sugar. The biochemistry of sugar uptake and metabolism in flight muscles shall be examined. This research shall involve collaboration with international scientists, the training of an American graduate student at UC Santa Barbara, and collaboration with a female Hispanic graduate student at UC Berkeley. Elementary and high school students shall be provided exposure to field research in ecological physiology. The results shall allow a further test of the hypothesis that hummingbird behavior and metabolism have coadapted to maximize net energy gain and will lead to insights into the energetics of hummingbird migrations. The findings shall contribute to the understanding of the problems faced by animals as a consequence of global climate change.

Although their importance in brain function is evident, inhibitory interneurons have been difficult to study because they resemble other nearby nerve cells; little is known about how they are regulated. A strain of genetically modified transgenic mice has been developed, in which inhibitory interneurons fluoresce under ultraviolet light. These transgenic mice will be utilized to target the inhibitory interneurons for study in relative isolation from the rest of the brain and to separate them from other types of nearby cells. The area of the brain stem to be studied receives input from most organ systems, and these inhibitory interneurons play critical roles in processing that sensory information, helping to integrate it with information from the rest of the brain before sending command signals to the nerve cells that control organ function. Some of the most abundant chemicals made in the brain are a class of opioid peptides (i.e., the brain's natural morphine). These peptides have profound effects on organ function, but the specific effects on inhibitory interneurons in the brain stem are unknown. Part of this study aims to determine the effects of one class of these opioid peptides on the specific activities of inhibitory interneurons involved in controlling digestion. <br/>The broader impacts of the research include advancing our understanding of this important brain region and scientific training for both graduate and undergraduate students. Results of these studies will impact several scientific fields of study, including physiology, endocrinology, digestion, and cardiovascular biology. Results will be disseminated by publishing the data and by presentation at national meetings and symposia.

Reed<br/>U of Southern California<br/><br/>In this research we will study a methodology for solving a class of convex optimization problems (COPs) in analytically feasible and computationally efficient ways. These problems are frequently encountered in many information processing applications, especially in wireless communication systems equipped with multiple transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) antennas for beamforming, equalization, joint optimal design of Tx-Rx and power control. Two types of convex optimization will be investigated in this research: (1) un-constrained<br/>or constrained with equalities, and (2) constrained with mixed equalities and inequalities. Most of<br/>conventional beamformings (diversity combining) at Rx fall into the first type, whereas, when joint Tx-Rx optimizations with power control are involved, the problems tend to be complicated with mixed constraints, and become the second type. The closed-form solutions to related COPs of the first type are known in many cases, but difficult to compute in real time, whereas some COPs of the second type may not be analytically solvable.

Gross <br/>Institution: Rutgers University New Brunswick <br/>Title: Complex Datasets and Inverse Problems: Tomography, Networks, and Beyond <br/><br/><br/>The conference ``Complex Datasets and Inverse Problems: Tomography, Networks, and Beyond'' will be held October 21-22, 2005 at Rutgers University. The conference will focus on a number of important and emerging interdisciplinary areas of research, including medical tomography, networks, and biased data. Statistical tomography algorithms have been playing crucial roles in the development of medical imaging systems, from CAT, PET, SPECT to MRI. In fast functional MRI, brain functions are studied from data sets composed of multiple time series of incomplete Fourier transformation of the deoxy spin density of the brain. Networks are abundant around us: social, energy, traffic, communication, and computer are just some of the examples. Enormous amount of networks data have been collected in the information age we live in, but few statistical tools have been developed for analyzing them as they are typically governed by time-varying and mutually dependent communication protocols sitting on complicated graph-structured network topologies. Many prototypical applications in these and other important technologies can be viewed as statistical inverse problems with large, high-dimensional, and probably biased/incomplete data, which serve as the unifying ground for the conference. <br/><br/>The conference will advance several important areas in statistics, including models and methodologies for complex datasets, inverse problems, imaging systems, networks, and incomplete and biased data. Cutting-edge developments of statistical models, methods, and algorithms will be discussed. The conference will have direct impact on a broad range of scientific applications outside the immediate realm of statistics. Examples include functional MRI and other medical imaging systems, telecommunication, energy, transportation, and social networks, network security, bioinformatics, epidemiology, and clinical trials. The conference is expected to attract researchers in different areas of applications, in medical imaging, telecommunications, bio-medical engineering, bioinformatics, epidemiology, and more. These will comprise both internationally renowned experts and graduate students or young researchers who wish to embark in these rapidly progressing interdisciplinary areas. Time will be generously allotted for informal discussion and fruitful exchange of ideas. Through these activities, the conference will play an important role in fostering new research partnership between young and senior participants and among researchers in different areas of applications. The conference will promote research activities, education, and participation of new investigators, graduate students, and researchers from under-represented groups. The proceedings of the conference have been arranged to be published as a volume in the Institute of Mathematical Statistics Monograph series. This publication will help disseminate widely the advances covered in the conference, especially among the researchers who are not able to attend the conference.

Exploration of subglacial environments is a new, interdisciplinary scientific endeavor. Recently discovered lakes in these environments represent an exciting frontier for research on life in extreme environments, glaciology, climatology, and geology. Apart from discoveries about our own planet, the work has direct application to extraterrestrial bodies with liquid water, such as Jupiter's moon Europa. This workshop will develop an advanced science and technology plan to study subglacial environments over the next decade. It will be held in Grenoble, France, to ensure broad international participation. <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this workshop will promote international collaboration, broaden the perspective of U.S. scientists, and provide an opportunity for the next generation of scientists to interact with leaders in the field. Outcomes will be published in a proceedings volume, and have societal relevance in understanding global climate change.
0504825	Quantum Superposition States of a Mirror	PHY	OPTICAL PHYSICS	08/01/2005	07/04/2007	Dirk Bouwmeester	CA	University of California-Santa Barbara	Continuing grant	Robert Dunford	07/31/2008	$360,000.00		bouwmeester@physics.ucsb.edu	Office of Research	Santa Barbara	CA	931062050	8058934188	MPS	1290	0000, 1767, 7237, OTHR	$0.00	Quantum Mechanics is based on a wave-mechanical description of a system and on the von Neumann postulate (1920s) that a quantum measurement results in an indeterministic outcome. The wave-mechanical description allows for superposition states of a system (e.g. an object being in two places at the same time), and the von Neumann postulate implies that one cannot directly detect such a superposition. Models of environmental induced decoherence do give an explanation of why quantum superpositions are not observed in everyday life, however the indeterministic nature of the measurement outcome is still the topic of many debates. The aim of this research proposal is to create a quantum superposition states involving of order 10^14 atoms. Such quantum superposition states will be ten orders of magnitude more massive than any quantum superposition observed to date and will therefore provide a fundamental test of quantum mechanics in a new regime.<br/><br/>The experiment contains a tiny mirror (smaller in diameter than the thickness of a human hair) that is part of an optical cavity, which forms one arm of an interferometer. The mirror is mounted on a tiny Silicon rod and can be displaced by the multiple reflections of a photon. A single photon is sent into the interferometer and will evolve into a superposition of being inside the optical cavity with the tiny mirror, thereby slightly displacing it, and being in the other arm of the interferometer, leaving the mirror at rest. The superposition of a single photon is therefore transferred to a superposition of the mirror, or more precise, the mirror becomes entangled with the photon. By observing the interference of the photon leaving the interferometer one can study the creation and decoherence of superpositions involving the mirror. Preliminary experiments have been supported by a one-year NSF exploratory-research grant and led to remarkable initial progress; a high-quality Bragg mirror of diameter 20 microns has been fabricated using a focussed ion beam and has been positioned onto a Silicon cantilever [tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM)]. The cantilever/mirror system has been piezo-positioned to be the end mirror of an optical cavity. Measurements in air showed an initial cavity finesse of 1000.<br/><br/>The individual components of the precision measurement system will be of interest for applications in many other fields with direct benefits to society. Anticipated spin-off projects are ultra-fast switchable mirrors (for optical communication), ultra-high resolution AFM readout, and optical cooling of micro-mechanical oscillators (for position measurements). The project will provide excellent training since it combines fundamental research interests with cutting-edge technologies. Since the project involves different subprojects, it is the intention to have several undergraduate researchers assisting the project each summer, as well a high-school students participating in the UCSB summer science education program.

Unfortunately, software engineering techniques that are useful in building robust dynamically modified software are woefully lacking. In general, extensive testing and debugging are the traditional ways of ensuring the robustness of sofware. The problem of debugging a program where the underlying code is changing at run-time makes the problem all the more difficult. <br/><br/>The aim of this proposed research is to address this situation and develop new techniques for debugging dynamically modified software. The key idea is that debugging for such software must extend through the code modification and allow debugging on code that has been changed and to see how past and future adaptations has/can affect execution. The proposed work considers several types of dynamic code modifications, including dynamically optimized code, dynamically applied code patches, components and dynamically linked libraries. New debug directives and queries will be developed specifically to address the challenges of debugging such code. Novel techniques based on code analysis, reverse execution, checkpointing, and instrumentation optimization will be used to enable these new directives and queries.<br/><br/>This research has both fundamental and software contributions, including: (1) a better understanding of the constraints and trade-offs that exist for developing robust dynamically modified software, (2) a framework that supports the construction of debugging techniques and tools that are useful when developing dynamically software, (3) the development of debug strategies, directives and queries that are designed to handle the special challenges of dynamically modified code, and (4) the development of a set of debugging tools for dynamic software that will be widely distributed. The techniques, tools and algorithms that will be developed through the course of this research will contribute significantly to understanding how modern software development techniques can be incorporated with dynamic code modifications.

The workshop will (1) discuss and document the shortage of women in academic chemistry and the need for more women on chemistry faculties; (2) enable sharing among participants of proven means for attracting women into academic chemistry careers; and (3) explore new ways to draw women to chemistry faculties at major research institutions in the U.S.<br/><br/>Chemistry departments continue to have low numbers of female faculty members despite considerable increases in recent undergraduate and doctorate chemistry degrees to women (currently about 50% and 33 %, respectively). The workshop will present evidence that research and teaching are improved when academic chemistry faculties come from a larger and more diverse talent pool. The workshop is viewed as having potentially broad impact not only within chemistry, but other disciplines as well.

The Protein Structure Initiative (http://www.nigms.nih.gov/psi/) and other recent efforts have targeted the accurate determination of protein structures for all genes encoded in genomes.  The result has been a rapid increase in the number of proteins for which the 3D structure is known, which has enabled a new computational approach to the study of protein structure and function based upon recurring amino-acid packing patterns or spatial motifs in a collection of known protein structures. These spatial motifs may correlate with experimental measurements of protein function or with specific protein families. Our preliminary work supports the premise that such spatial motifs may be a more suitable starting point for protein function research than sequence level motifs. In this project, we propose to undertake a comprehensive analysis of protein structures. We will mine the protein structures available in the PDB (Protein Data Bank) for spatial motifs, and construct each protein's signature as a combination of such motifs.  Similarity measures between the signatures can serve as the basis of various predictions of protein structural and functional classifications. We will look for family specific motifs (measured by enrichment significance) and significant associations between occurrences of spatial motifs.<br/>This project will integrate novel techniques to link recurring structural patterns in protein families with protein function. The proposed studies will have significant impact on modern structural biology. Recent studies, including those conducted by our group, indicate that protein spatial motifs can be used for effective protein annotation, comparison, and classification. It will advance the frontiers of biology research by providing a novel, high-throughput mechanism for discovering, evaluating and annotating functionally significant spatial motifs derived from protein classifications - making a fundamental impact on the way biologists propose and test hypotheses that relate protein structure and function. Broader Impacts of this research include interdisciplinary collaboration and training, a multitude of educational impacts, and outreach to underrepresented minorities in the sciences.<br/><br/><br/>

Two approaches for achieving high quality InAs, InSb, and III-Sb device heterostructures will be investigated: growth of nanometer-scale, highly lattice mismatched layers directly on insulating substrates using solid-phase epitaxy and recrystallization, and creation of composite substrates by wafer bonding using lattice-matched epitaxial films to enable subsequent regrowth of epitaxial InAs, InSb, and III-Sb heterostructures. Surface passivation is also a critical issue in nanodevices; novel non-aqueous surface passivation schemes will be investigated. The device research includes experimental and theoretical study of nanoscale transistors for logic as well as heterostructure backward tunnel diodes for millimeter-wave and THz sensing. Two transistor architectures-aggressively-scaled InAs and InSb channel field-effect transistors, and field-assisted lateral tunneling nanotransistors-will be explored, using extremely-mismatched materials grown on scalable insulating substrates. <br/><br/>The program includes research-based training of undergraduate and graduate students in a team environment. Students will present their work at national and international venues to enhance their communication and presentation skills in preparation for research careers. The cross-disciplinary nature of the research lends itself to the development of case studies and examples for curricular enrichment, e.g. a means to introduce students to issues in materials science, surface science and chemistry, process and materials integration, and semiconductor device physics. The research will provide fundamental and new knowledge in materials science, as well as have far-reaching impact on electronic systems design and environmental and remote sensing.

Despite its wide application, this canonical framework raises several puzzles and does not always match empirical evidence on individual behavior. One important assumption in the standard expected utility model is that agents consume a single consumption good, a composite commodity. This project plans to investigate risk preferences when such a composite commodity does not exist, because one of the consumption goods involves a commitment in that its consumption can only be adjusted at a cost. The researrch results will be applied to three issues: 1) Optimal portfolio choice; 2) Optimal social insurance; 3) The impact of commitments and background risk on excess returns. <br/><br/>The basic intuition underlying this project can be summarized using the following model. When agents have commitments such as housing, the static budget constraint implies that moderate-scale shocks are fully borne over the subset of discretionary consumption goods like food. Since shocks are concentrated on a subset of goods, the marginal utility of wealth rises quickly. As a result, risk aversion over moderate-stake gambles is high relative to that over larger gambles, when the shock can be spread over the entire budget set. In preliminary work, the investigators have extended this intuition to a dynamic model with a time-dependent adjustment rule where commitments can only be adjusted infrequently. They show that higher commitments amplify risk aversion and lead to fewer risky assets in household portfolios. They test this prediction by using the timing of marital shocks (marriage, divorce) to create exogenous variation in commitments, and find that commitments play an important role in explaining the heterogeneity in portfolios. An important limitation of the previous work is that it does not simultaneously model dynamics and adjustment costs. This project builds a model that incorporates both of these features, as well as borrowing constraints. Two new, opposing factors will affect the impact of commitments on risk preferences: intertemporal substitution and cash commitments like mortgage. Given these forces, the quantitative relevance of commitments for risk preferences becomes an empirical question. This model suggests two strategies to obtain estimates of the importance of commitments in micro data: 1) Compare the elasticity of discretionary consumption to unemployment shocks for households with different commitment levels. 2) Test whether households facing shorter unemployment spells (smaller shocks) reduce discretionary consumption more in the short run. These estimates will be used in two applications. The first is to improve our understanding of social insurance. In contrast with actual government policies, most existing studies about optimal social insurance programs find that insurance should be provided primarily for large-scale shocks. However, this project finds that commitments will generate a countervailing force that makes the optimal insurance level for small, transitory shocks such as unemployment significantly higher. The second application is in asset pricing. The investigators plan to investigate the idea that the presence of uninsurable labor income risk can have a large impact on the equity premium and stock market participation when commitments magnify risk aversion. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project include normative results that should be of interest to both policy makers and investors. The project would enable the investigators to compute the magnitude and gauge the importance of the commitments effect on the optimal structure of major government expenditure programs such as unemployment and disability insurance. It also has quantitative lessons for the optimal design of portfolios (e.g., in a privatized social security system), and informs the portfolio choice of investors with substantial spending commitments, such as universities.

The total number of days at sea in 2005 is 262 days. The programs to be supported for NSF include Climate History Studies (Nicholson, 0350573), Hydrothermal vent systems (Kelley, 0426109) and Magma studies by Haymon, 0324668. These programs are all funded by the Marine Geology and Geophysics Program and require instrumentation that is on the Thompson. In addition, Ken Smith (0242472) is funded by Biological Oceanography to study phytoplankton at abyssal depths. The Thompson appears to be well suited to support these programs in terms of equipment and experience with ROV ops. This is year one of a five year cooperative agreement. The amount of the award in out-years on this agreement will be negotiated yearly, and is dependent on the number of days at sea in support of NSF funded research programs.<br/><br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The Marine Operations Department of the School of Oceanography of the University of Washington takes pride in providing essential marine science research and educational facilities to NSF-funded investigators. The University of Washington remains committed to managing these facilities in a safe, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible manner. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The mission of the Thompson also includes the provision of educational opportunities-both to students of the marine sciences, and, through educational outreach programs such as REVEL, Teacher at Sea, to K through 12th grade students, nationwide. Periodically, The University holds a two day open house and outreach event to provide a learning experience for 3rd grade through high school senior students including tours through the ship facilities and hands-on demonstrations of marine science research guided by faculty, students and ships' crewmembers. In March of 2005, we are inviting the winning team from the CORE-sponsored National Ocean Sciences Bowl (NOSB) to bring their students and coaches along on one of state-funded marine science education cruises in Puget Sound. The University of Washington, with the support of the National Science Foundation and with coordination by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, remains dedicated to, and focused upon, furthering mankind's understanding of the world ocean, the living and non-living resources therein, and their interactions with the approximately fifty percent of our citizens who live within fifty miles of the shoreline.

Despite this tremendous amount of known diversity, recognized ecological importance, and interesting evolutionary history, the group remains largely unstudied. Current estimates based on known degrees of endemism suggest that there may be as many as 80,000 extant species on the planet today. The project summarized here is a continuation of a previous Partnership for Enhancing Expertise in Taxonomy (PEET) training program to develop new millipede taxonomy and systematics expertise. The investigators Petra Sierwald (The Field Museum of Natural History), Jason Bond (East Carolina University) and William Shear (Hampden-Sydney College) propose to maintain an established program of millipede research and student training by capitalizing on the insights achieved from the previous PEET award. Major project products anticipated are evolutionary and taxonomic studies published in the primary literature, web disseminated tools (e.g. taxonomic identification keys) to aid other non-specialist researchers, acquisition of specimens to be deposited in natural history collections, and a worldwide species catalog, the first of its kind encapsulating the millipede taxonomic literature spanning over two centuries.<br/>Foremost, the goal of this project is to develop a sustainable community of knowledgeable, trained researchers working on this important group of organisms. This goal will be achieved by training at least three postdoctoral researchers, two graduate students, and at least six undergraduate interns. Trainee projects include a broad phylogenetic assessment of the Diplopoda and taxonomic and systematics studies of millipede groups chosen from across at least three separate orders. In short this project aims to make significant contributions to science and education by training the next generation of millipede systematists. In both a Museum (natural history collections) and University environment, trainees will acquire methods and skills that will prepare them for future positions as researchers, teachers, and resource managers in biology and entomology. In terms of millipedes, the improved phylogenetic structure, taxonomic revisions, and methodological advances attained over the course of this 5-year project will provide a sound foundation for future systematic workers.

Underrepresented minorities (URMs) currently form an extremely small percentage of students interested in ocean and other geosciences. The low numbers of URMs at upper-division levels are due in part to low retention of freshmen. Important contributing factors are the lack of success in introductory courses and lack of awareness of possible careers. Thus, in our Campus to the Coast program we address these problems directly and at an early stage in the college educational process. <br/>To meet these goals we focus on: 1) recruitment; 2) a pre-freshman experience [Ocean Sciences or Visit SML]; 3) a pre-sophomore experience [SML summer courses]; and 4) mentoring and networking by peers, near-peers, and faculty. The institutional partners in this proposal are the Shoals Marine Laboratory, Cornell University, and the University of New Hampshire. The program serves <br/>26-38 URM students per summer. <br/>The team closely collaborates with admissions and multicultural offices to alert high school students to opportunities in marine sciences by educating admissions staff about ocean sciences at UNH and Cornell, meet with URM students and families on campus hosting weekends, and provide Cornell and UNH admissions staff with information about our program. <br/>We offer two kinds of first-summer programs at SML. First there is an intensive three week program for ten students called Ocean Sciences that: (a) is inquiry-based and teaches critical thinking and collaborative learning within the context of ocean sciences; (b) excites and motivates students through direct interaction with marine environments and organisms; (c) involves careful assessment and a focus on improving individual learning skills; and (d) is taught in a small class setting, with extensive interaction with faculty and near-peer instructors. Second, for those students not able to take our Ocean Sciences course, we offer a short four-day program for ten students called Visit SML that introduces the opportunities and adventure of marine science. <br/>Six to eighteen students [for a total of 72 credit-hours per summer] take SML courses in areas of marine science of special interest to the individual student as part of the second summer program. Funding for the Second Summer Program is provided entirely through sources at Cornell, UNH and SML.

Witt	07/31/2011	$629,196.00		ahb3@cornell.edu	373 Pine Tree Road	Ithaca	NY	148502820	6072555014	BIO	1193, 7472, 7714	1096, 9178, 9183, 9251, BIOT	$0.00	Steroid hormones exert powerful effects on a wide range of mechanisms ranging from development and reproduction to cognition and the establishment of social hierarchies. The new studies proposed here will identify the cellular and molecular events that mediate rapid steroid actions on nerve cells (neurons) that directly generate behavior, in this case vocalizations that are essential for social communication.  Long-term influences of steroids on the development and maintenance of vocal behaviors and neurons is well known, but their short-term actions is both unexpected and essentially unexplored. The vocal control system of teleost fish presents the most basic example of how the central nervous system of vertebrates produces social, context-dependent vocalizations. The PI has discovered that androgens, estrogen and cortisol (the major stress steroid in teleost fish) induce rapid changes in the output of vocal neurons that parallel the time course of steroid effects on natural calling behaviors. This now provides a model to study the physiological basis for rapid steroid effects on neurons that directly lead to changes in a social behavior. Neurophysiological, molecular and behavioral methods will be used to show how steroids shape neuronal function, where the receptors that mediate these effects are located, and how vocal behaviors are influenced by one or more steroids. The principles identified apply to other vertebrates because vocal, neural and endocrine mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved between teleosts and other groups, including birds and mammals. This research has, and will continue to, train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students of both sexes from diverse cultural backgrounds and geographic regions and make the results of the research easily accessible to the general public through publications, press interviews and presentations at professional societies, universities, marine biology laboratories and local community science centers.

Barbara Whitney (Space Science Institute), Fabian Heitsch (University Observatory, Munich, Germany), Alexandre Lazarian (University of Wisconsin, Madison) and Michael Wolff (Space Science Institute) will undertake a program to provide improved tools for interpreting polarization data in star formation regions. This will be accomplished by combining radiation transfer, magneto-hydrodynamic simulations, and grain alignment theories. Modification of existing codes will be used to calculate emission, extinction, and scattering from aligned grains while simultaneously solving for the temperature of the grains as a function of grain size, in arbitrary 3-D density structures with arbitrary luminosity sources. The codes will provide spectral energy distributions and images, including linear and circular polarization, at any wavelength. Computation of molecular cloud/cloud core density and magnetic field grids, using an MHD code using the latest grain alignment theories, will also be undertaken. The purpose of the program is to test grain alignment theories and probe magnetic structures in disks, protostellar envelopes, and molecular clouds. The tools developed in this research program will be made available to the general astronomical community, providing for a broader impact.

Unfortunately, software engineering techniques that are useful in building robust dynamically modified software are woefully lacking. In general, extensive testing and debugging are the raditional ways of ensuring the robustness of sofware. The problem of debugging a program wherethe underlying code is changing at run-time makes the problem all the more difficult. <br/><br/>The aim of this proposed research is to address this situation and develop new techniques for debugging dynamically modified software. The key idea is that debugging for such software must extend through the code modification and allow debugging on code that has been changed and to see how past and future adaptations has/can affect execution. The proposed work considers several types of dynamic code modifications, including dynamically optimized code, dynamically applied code patches, components and dynamically linked libraries. New debug directives and queries will be developed specifically to address the challenges of debugging such code. Novel techniques based on code analysis, reverse execution, checkpointing, and instrumentation optimization will be used to enable these new directives and queries.<br/><br/>This research has both fundamental and software contributions, including: (1) a better understanding of the constraints and trade-offs that exist for developing robust dynamically modified software, (2) a framework that supports the construction of debugging techniques and tools that are useful when developing dynamically software, (3) the development of debug strategies, directives and queries that are designed to handle the special challenges of dynamically modified code, and (4) the development of a set of debugging tools for dynamic software that will be widely distributed. The techniques, tools and algorithms that will be developed through the course of this research will contribute significantly to understanding how modern software development techniques can be incorporated with dynamic code modifications.

Nagy, <br/>Proposal number: 0517218<br/>Suppression of viral RNA recombination by host genes. <br/><br/>Emergence of new RNA viruses is frequently due to RNA recombination, a process that joins noncontiguous RNA segments together. Novel combinations of genes, sequence motifs or regulatory RNA sequences resulting from recombination may cause dramatic changes in the infectious properties of RNA viruses. This, in turn, helps viruses to jump species, to overcome natural resistance mechanisms and renders vaccines and other antiviral methods ineffective. In order to advance our understanding of the role of the host in viral RNA recombination, the PI has recently developed yeast-based replication and recombination systems for a model plant virus, Cucumber necrosis tombusvirus (CNV). This approach led to the identification of five host genes suppressing viral RNA recombination. To characterize the roles of the identified host factors in RNA recombination, the PI will use the advanced genetics tools available for yeast in combination with biochemical approaches. <br/><br/>Potential impact of the proposed work: The research described here will lead to better understanding of the effect of host genes on RNA recombination and the role of the host in virus evolution. Because the role of host genes in viral RNA recombination is currently unknown, the proposed work may dramatically change our view of the role of the host in viral RNA recombination. Broader impacts of the proposed work: This grant will allow training of high school and undergraduate students in the PI's laboratory. This research will promote interdisciplinary (plant pathology, biochemistry, genetics) learning. The research holds promise of benefiting society by leading to groundbreaking results in the area of virus recombination/evolution and the emergence of new viruses.

College Station	TX	778454645	9798477635	CSE	4096, 7351	9218, HPCC	$0.00	When an analog source such as an audio or video signal is transmitted over a noisy channel, typically the source is first quantized and compressed (source coded) and then encoded to make it robust to the noisy channel (channel coded). For a class of channels called ergodic channels, it is optimal to separately perform source and channel coding. This principle has served as an engineering guideline to design several modern communication systems. However non-ergodic channels are encountered in several practical communication systems, for example in broadcasting a source to many users. For this class of channels, the separation based approach is not necessarily optimal. The focus of this work in understanding and providing guidelines for performing source and channel coding for such channels.<br/><br/>Three separate but related problems in coding for non-ergodic channels are considered. The first is that of minimizing a measure of end-to-end distortion such as expected mean squared error in communicating a source over a non-ergodic noisy channel. The focus is on the design of analog and hybrid analog to digital joint source-channel coding techniques which can outperform conventional separation based digital approaches. Then the design of practical universal channel codes for non-ergodic channels with memory is considered and it is shown that coded decision feedback signal processing is a promising technique to solve these problems. Finally, the design of universal codes for distributed compression where the underlying correlation model is not perfectly known is considered.<br/><br/>Apart from standard educational activities, a key aspect of the broader impact is in creating avenues for our students to interact with researchers from other universities.

The project proposes to duplicate the function of the early visual system in a multichip neuromorphic system with two hundred and thirty thousand silicon neurons (three quarters the number of pixels in a VGA image) and three billion synaptic interactions several orders of magnitude larger than anything built to date. The outcome of this project will be SEER, a subwatt, paperback-size seeing machine. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed research stems from the tight synergy between the <br/>computational theory, based on the principle of compositionality ,and the neuromorphic implementation, based on reentrant networks. Compositionality dictates that the various parts of the vision problem should be attacked simultaneously and reentrancy gives us the capability to do exactly that. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed effort could be enormous. A multichip neuromorphic system performing multimodal segmentations would reinvigorate robotics and computer vision. By providing the infrastructure for early vision, it will facilitate the study of cognition, which will most likely generate a flood of new theories and experiments, in the Neurosciences and in the sciences of the artificial.

DNA self-assembly is a key tool for nano-technology, nano-robotics, and molecular computation. More generally, biological organisms are self-organized chemical systems that carry out algorithms encoded in the genetic material, DNA. Biology thus provides clear proof that autonomous chemical systems can be programmed, and that they can function reliably on a grand scale -- biological organisms can be composed of as many as 1024 molecular components!<br/><br/>Recent experimental advances in the synthesis of artificial molecular systems have demonstrated that it is possible to program molecular self-assembly to carry out rudimentary logic. These experiments also suggested that the occurrence of errors is a major obstacle to scaling up DNA self-assembly and biologically inspired computation. This project will devise algorithmic tools and analysis techniques for error-correction and error-suppression in biologically inspired self-assembling and computational systems. It is our hope that our research will facilitate sophisticated tasks such as counting, growing molecular assemblies of pre-specified sizes (no larger, no smaller), and pattern recognition of complex chemical signals using inherently error-prone biomolecular operations at the nano-scale.<br/><br/>In order to design and analyze our error-correction mechanisms, we will use high level models which are both sufficiently realistic to be useful and sufficiently abstract to be amenable to analysis. The basic elements of our models will be DNA tiles, transcriptional circuits, and DNA hybridization catalysts. Thus, our research will target assembly of and computation with large molecules such as long chains of DNA rather than smaller molecules such as proteins and amino acids.<br/><br/>We will also develop course material on the basis of our research which will be taught at Caltech and at Stanford.

Consistency requirements in superstring theory suggest<br/>that we live in a 10-dimensional world, where the extra six<br/>dimensions must take the shape of a Calabi-Yau geometry. For the<br/>past 20 years, this has led to a tremendous effort on the part of<br/>mathematicians and physicists to understand Calabi-Yau spaces,<br/>and the various questions which emerge from their role in string<br/>theory. On the other hand, more classical areas of physics such<br/>as general relativity continue to motivate interesting questions<br/>in Riemannian geometry. In particular, extending the Positive<br/>Mass Conjecture has important implications for geometric analysis<br/>and string theory.<br/><br/>The first two projects in this proposal examine the geometry of<br/>Calabi-Yau spaces. In studying such objects, one has to take into<br/>consideration singular Calabi-Yaus. One way to deal with<br/>singularities is to resolve them. As a result, the geometrical<br/>structure undergoes changes. The goal of the first research<br/>project is to give a complete characterization of the changes<br/>which can occur under crepant resolutions. In contrast to more<br/>traditional algebraic methods, the proposed techniques for this<br/>study involve an interplay between algebraic and analytical<br/>methods. Another way to deal with Calabi-Yau singularities is to<br/>analyze them from the perspective of various string theory<br/>dualities. In the second project, the PI proposes to study the<br/>taxonomy of Calabi-Yau spaces for which heterotic/F-theory<br/>dualities hold. Along the way, it is hoped that this study will<br/>give a geometrical interpretation to a new conjecture of McKay<br/>which relates the exceptional simply-laced Dynkin diagrams to the<br/>Monster group and its offspring. The focus of the third project<br/>is the Positive Mass Conjecture. In the context of general<br/>relativity it has been proved that the total mass of an isolated<br/>system is never negative, provided that the sources of the<br/>gravitational field consist of matter with nonnegative local mass<br/>density and that spacetime is asymptotically flat. Witten's proof<br/>is based on the analysis of the Dirac operator along<br/>three-dimensional spacelike submanifolds in spacetime. The goal<br/>of this research is to extend Witten's approach to prove the<br/>Positive Mass Conjecture in any dimension, in particular for<br/>non-spin manifolds.<br/><br/>To summarize, an assortment of questions in mathematics lie at<br/>the interface between geometry and physics. This proposal focuses<br/>on geometry problems which do not fit nicely into one particular<br/>field, but require a variety of techniques from different<br/>branches of geometry. Many of these problems come from physics,<br/>where ad-hoc methods need further development.

These real-world full-scale tests<br/>provide information that would be very difficult to duplicate in laboratory experiments and it seems logical to study the damages that take place. From this information and from inferred wind speeds occurring during such events it should be possible to develop countermeasures to eliminate or reduce potential future damage. In view of the pressing needs in the area of wind hazards reduction and benefits of coordinated damage investigations demonstrated by the earthquake engineering community, over the past two years American Association for Wind Engineering (AAWE) undertook three initiatives in the area of wind damage documentation. In 2003 two research teams were sent to investigate representative damages due to significant tornadoes and a major hurricane. In 2004, a one-day workshop was organized, following the hurricane season. This proposal seeks reimbursement of travel costs associated with the three initiatives. A brief presentation of the background information, the scope of the research effort and justification of the requested funds are included in this proposal.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this SGER proposal is the ability to systematically address issues of wind damage investigations and damage documentation. Both these broader impacts will aid development of guidelines for analysis and design of wind-resistant buildings and structures. These efforts will ultimately lead to reduction in loss of human life and property due to wind.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal will include the ability to develop methodology for systematic and coordinated acquisition, documentation and dissemination of data on wind<br/>damages.<br/><br/>

Magnetic resonance is the principal tool of our research, which is sensitive to the formation of inhomogeneous phases, as well as electron spin dynamics. It can be applied in a diverse set of extreme conditions that we continue to develop and expand on, including low temperatures, high pressures, and as wide a range of applied magnetic fields as is available. The principal interest is in learning of the nature of low-temperature phases accessed by the manipulation, and what controls the stability of one phase over another. The project involves researchers at many stages of their training, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates.<br/><br/>*** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT ***<br/><br/>In the course of this project, solid state magnetic resonance techniques will be employed to address current questions related to novel and competing ground states in selected correlated electron systems. The materials fall into two classes known for very different microscopic physics: itinerant ferromagnets and molecular conductors. In both cases, Coulomb interactions between charge carriers lead to an interesting variety of phases, including liquid-like states with low-temperature properties inconsistent with existing theories. These studies will lead to new scientific understandings of correlated matter, and new experimental techniques suitable for a broad range of<br/>applications. Young scientists, at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, will be trained in the course of this project.

Head at Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, Canada.<br/><br/>Zooplankton in marine ecosystems provide a critical link between planktonic primary producers and higher trophic levels, such as fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Variability in zooplankton abundance appears to be related to climate variability in many ocean regions, but the mechanisms that drive these relationships are poorly understood. The objectives of the proposed research are to identify the processes that control interannual variability in zooplankton abundance and community structure on the Scotian Shelf, in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, and to develop a mechanistic understanding of climate effects on zooplankton populations. Three complementary data sets, each resolving different space and time scales, are used to characterize spatial and temporal scales of zooplankton variability. Specific questions that are addressed include (1) does water origin or in situ biological processes have a greater influence on Scotian Shelf zooplankton variability; (2) is it possible to control for water mass origin in a long time series of low spatial resolution; and (3) is advection from the Scotian Shelf is a good predictor of downstream, Gulf of Maine, zooplankton variability? Several previous studies suggest that transport and spatial variability of Scotian Shelf water masses can influence zooplankton variability; however, by controlling for water masses, the proposed research allows the influence of in situ processes to be quantified. Understanding zooplankton interannual variability is essential to understanding ecosystem responses to climate. Synthesis of zooplankton data sets focused on different spatial and temporal scales enhances the interpretive value of each data set. The proposed research identifies zooplankton community and abundance shifts that may affect fish recruitment in the northwest Atlantic, and it contributes to development of ecosystem-based fisheries management on the Scotian Shelf. It also facilitates identification of ecologically significant regions of the Scotian Shelf for conservation and representative locations where long-term zooplankton time series can most effectively be focused.

Ever since Shannon's work on both information theory and<br/>computer science, the research in the interplay between IT and CS has<br/>continued and expanded in many exciting ways. In 2003 the first NSF<br/>sponsored Workshop on the IT and CS Interface was held in Chicago,<br/>while in 2004 a graduate course on analytic methods in information<br/>theory and analysis of algorithms was organized at MSRI, Berkeley. We<br/>build on this momentum and propose to work on problems of information<br/>theory, combinatorics, and analysis of algorithms. Following Knuth's<br/>and Hadamard's precept, we study such problems using techniques of<br/>complex analysis. This program, which applies complex-analytic tools<br/>to information theory, constitutes ``analytic information theory''.<br/><br/>This research is focused on some facets of source coding, such as the<br/>redundancy rate problem, method of types, entropy evaluation, channel<br/>capacity, and joint channel-source coding. The redundancy rate problem<br/>for a class of sources is the determination of how far the actual code<br/>length exceeds the optimal (ideal) code length, while the method of<br/>types is a powerful technique in information theory, large deviations,<br/>and analysis of algorithms. It is argued that counting types can be<br/>accomplished efficiently by enumerating Eulerian paths (Markov types)<br/>or binary trees with a given path length (universal types). Likewise,<br/>analysis of the redundancy rate problem for memoryless and Markov<br/>sources leads us to interesting generating functions such as tree<br/>generating functions (e.g., arising in counting labeled rooted trees),<br/>which are studied extensively in computer science.

Novel fine-tunable monodentate phosphorus ligands and their applications to highly efficient catalytic asymmetric reactions and processes will also be explored. Particular attention will be placed on green chemistry concepts, including high selectivity and atom economy as well as the highly efficient separation and recovery of catalyst species, through the development of fluorous catalyst systems.<br/><br/>With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Iwao Ojima of the Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. One of the most fascinating goals in catalysis is to create effective catalyst systems that can promote multi-step reactions giving useful chemical substances, including those with multiple chiral centers, from simple starting materials. These catalyst systems should also promote the reactions with extremely high turnover frequency as well as turnover number and/or with highly efficient catalyst recovery and reuse without environmental concerns. Professor Ojima and his students are designing and developing new and efficient catalytic organic reactions incorporating (poly)cyclizations and carbonylations as key unit reactions, which provide useful synthetic methods for organic syntheses.

Although the worldwide distributions of Prochlorococcus are generally understood, the precise reasons for its overwhelming ecological success have remained elusive. This picture has recently become complicated by the discovery that Prochlorococcus is not monophyletic and that different genetic clades of Prochlorococcus have remarkably different distributions with depth and over oceanic basins. Thus, our understanding of factors that structure Prochlorococcus populations in the natural environment, and our ability to predict how this structure might respond to environmental changes, are limited. The PIs will address this by focusing on naturally occurring populations in the Western Pacific Warm Pool, an area where Prochlorococcus is known to dominate, but where there are no data on clade abundances. In addition to being a large region of the Pacific Ocean with significance to the global carbon cycle, the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) is of particular interest because it is typically highly stratified, with surface waters having extreme temperatures and light levels compared to those at depth. Populations of Prochlorococcus at the surface and at depth experience different environmental pressures, and may belong to different clades and have different adaptive physiologies. The PIs will test this hypothesis on a cruise from Christchurch, New Zealand to Hawaii through the stratified WPWP. Samples from this transect will be used to quantify (using quantitative PCR) the six known clades of Prochlorococcus and to search for new clades (using clone libraries and isolates) and their abundances. The ultimate goal is to relate clade abundances to temperature, light, nutrient concentrations and other measured biological, chemical and physical variables. <br/><br/>This project will encompass multiple layers of outreach to scientists and the scientific community at large. Data and strains will be deposited at national repositories and results will be disseminated through publications, professional meeting presentations, and a project web site. Undergraduates and graduate students will be trained, and students will be an integral part of the data collection, analysis, and dissemination phases and will be encouraged to present at national meetings. Cross-institutional training will enhance graduate student education. The PIs will integrate results from this project into undergraduate and graduate curricula at their home institutions and will be attending the NSF sponsored 'Scientific Inquiry in the K-16 Classroom' seminar to develop methods to link results to primary education. The PIs will use presentations and activities with local outreach groups, such as the Hawaii Academy of Sciences, to encourage scientific understanding through mentoring, science symposia and science competitions for primary and secondary school students.

The expression of these genes must be highly regulated and coordinated for this process to be successful. One class of proteins that regulates the expression of genes involved in nervous system development is the nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptor genes are encoded in the genomes of all animals. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is useful for studying the evolutionarily conserved roles of nuclear receptors because Drosophila has retained one of each of the 21 evolutionarily conserved nuclear receptor genes while other organisms have lost representatives, have duplicated one or more nuclear receptor genes, or have lost one or more while duplicating others. This project focuses on CG16801, a nuclear receptor gene that is expressed in a small number of cells within the Drosophila nervous system and whose function is required for the adult fly to crawl out of its pupal case at the completion of metamorphosis, for the young adult to expand its wings, and for fertility of both the male and female. Molecular genetic methods will be used to investigate the cellular function of CG16801 and to determine why males and females lacking CG16801 are sterile. These investigations are likely to provide key insights into the cellular and genetic basis of reproduction because only a small number of cells are involved making it feasible to uncover the role of individual cells. This project will have significantly broader impacts because it will support a scientist who is committed to teaching, learning, and training at all academic levels, it will support a laboratory that has an established record of training women and underrepresented minorities, and it will support research at a post-secondary minority institution within an NSF-designated EPSCoR state.

KDD is usually a multiphase process involving numerous steps such as data preparation, data preprocessing, feature selection, rule induction, knowledge evaluation and deployment etc. Many novel data mining and learning algorithms have been developed, though vigorously, under rather add hoc and vague concepts. These algorithms, in most cases, are individual creations of different researchers, without much common methodological and fundamental framework. In other words, great majority of work in data mining is focused on algorithm development while neglecting the studies of fundamental theoretical issues concerning data, inter-data relationships, and quality of the implicit information hidden in the data or data redundancies. Thus, it is not easy to fully understand and evaluate how individual phase influences each other and the impact of each phase on the whole knowledge discovery process. For further development and breakthroughs in data mining and learning algorithms, a deep examination of its foundation is necessary. The central goal of the proposed research is to develop a unified rough set based data mining framework to explore various fundamental issues of data mining and learning algorithms. It aims to present the analytical capabilities of the methodology of rough sets in the context of data mining methodologies, techniques and applications. It will provide a unified framework to help better understand the whole KDD process.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Rough set theory is particularly suited to reasoning about imprecise or incomplete data and discovering relationships in the data. The simplicity and mathematical clarity of rough set theory makes it attractive for both theoreticians and application-oriented researchers. The main advantage of rough set theory is that it does not require any preliminary or additional information about the data, such as probability in statistics, basic probability assignment in Dempster-Shafer theory or the value of membership in fuzzy set theory. Rough set theory constitutes a sound basis for KDD and can be used in different phases of the KDD process. In particular, the formal techniques of rough set theory lead to many novel and promising breakthrough methods and algorithms for attribute functional, or<br/>partial functional dependencies, their discovery, analysis, and characterization, feature election, feature extraction, data reduction, decision rule generation, and pattern extraction (templates, association rules) etc., which are the fundamental issues of the KDD process. Rough set theory represents a new innovative approach and can lead to the development of new learning algorithms to create novel uses and breakthroughs of data mining techniques.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The proposed collaborative project is interdisciplinary in nature. It will synthesize often-disparate work in data mining, rough set theory and high performance computing. The PIs' strong multidisciplinary research collaboration experience will lead to widespread awareness and impact of the proposed research to rough set, data mining and high performance computing community. It will design and develop a wide-range of novel data mining algorithms and methods including data reduction, rule induction and classification ensemble in one unified framework to better understand the whole KDD<br/>process. These algorithms and methods will significantly extend the application scope of data mining techniques and rough set theory and will result in the improved understanding of issues involved in designing efficient and innovative data mining and learning algorithms and methods. The proposed research will integrate tightly with teaching activities, the research results will be developed into undergraduate and graduate courses and research projects. Part of this approach includes the development of new cross-disciplinary courses that bring together computer science and mathematics for the understanding of principle and methods of theoretical foundations of data mining and rough set theory. The integration will help with training students in the issues involved in the rough set theory, design and implementation of novel data mining methods and algorithms, high performance computing. The active participation of students will allow for significant exposure to the latest research in data<br/>mining.

The research explores the circumstances under which smaller and more radical social movement organizations could potentially displace larger and more moderate organizations in terms of policy influence. Up until the late 1980s, environmental advocacy at the federal level was dominated by large, well-known mainstream organizations that relied primarily on an insider strategy to exert political influence. However by the 1990s, there was a significant influx of new smaller and more radical environmental groups using outsider strategies. This project will address two research questions: 1.) How are grassroots biodiversity protection groups able to increase their relative influence on federal policy? 2.) While these grassroots groups shared an outsider strategy, different groups took different approaches (including their tactics and organizational forms) in applying this strategy. Which of these approaches were most influential and why? To examine the second question, the project will undertake a comparative analysis of the approaches used in three biodiversity protection campaigns in order to evaluate their relative effectiveness. These three case studies will be examined on the basis of six key variables in social movement dynamics: strategy, tactics, organization, funding, movement culture, and external conditions. <br/><br/>Currently there are few published studies on grassroots biodiversity protection organizations. This study will thus contribute to our understanding of a significant but understudied development within the environmental movement. For environmental sociologists, this project offers insights into the dynamics of recent biodiversity protection campaigns. For social movement researchers, it contributes to the study of relationship between radical and moderate social movement organizations within a social movement. For policy analysts, this study gives increased attention to the role of small social movement organizations in the policy-making process. Findings from this research could potentially of use to a broader community. For research funding foundations, it offers an analysis of the impacts of different funding strategies on social movement effectiveness, and for those concerned with environmental sustainability, it provides an in-depth analysis of the success of grassroots biodiversity campaigns and a model for the implementation of environmental protections more broadly.

To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.<br/><br/>The research and training plan is entitled Roles of the bacteria, PA1, in larval and adult life histories of Porites corals.  The research uses molecular, cellular, and genomic approaches to describe and understand the role of a recently discovered Porites species-specific coral bacterial symbiont, named PA1.  The distribution of PA1 across Porites species and habitats provides clues about the ecological, phylogenetic, and ontogenic roles this bacteria plays for coral establishment, health, and resilience while completion of the genome will help determine how the PA1-Porites symbiosis is established, regulated, and altered.   The training plan consists of expanding the Fellow's breadth of knowledge and training her in a suite of lab and field based techniques in preparation for an academic career in the basic biology of marine organisms.<br/>

The courses are part of a larger community-driven effort - Integrated Solid Earth Sciences - to promote a new, integrated way of approaching teaching and research in the solid earth sciences. Examples o f course topics are Rheology of the Lithosphere, Geochronology Applied to Tectonics and Petrology, GeoInformatics, and Numerical and Scale Model studies of Deformation and Metamorphism, topics that are experiencing rapid advances and are exemplary of multi-disciplinary research fields. Fifteen to twenty senior graduate students are attending each 5-day long school in which expert scientists are presenting half-day long overviews, using a combination of lectures, computer demonstrations and/or hands-on demonstration. Special emphasis is given to the integration of disciplines through exercises and lectures. Field trips are an essential aspect of such schools as they provide venues for more open discussions about approaches that could be taken for field-based research. Topics of summer schools are also the same topics explored in the annual Integrated Solid Earth Sciences Forum held in association with a national scientific meeting (e.g, Geological Society of America, American Geophysical Union).

Waterman Award Committee recommended Dr. Dalton Conley, Professor of Sociology and Public Policy and Director of the Center for Advanced Social Sciences Research at New York University, be given the 2005 Alan T. Waterman Award. Dr. Dalton would be the second social scientist to receive this award. The first social science recipient of the Waterman Award was Dr. Lawrence H. Summers in 1987.<br/><br/>The Board, having considered the candidate of the Alan T. Waterman Award Committee, unanimously APPROVED the recommendation to present the 30th Alan T. Waterman Award to Dr. Dalton Conley. <br/><br/>Press Release 05-067<br/>NYU's Dalton Conley is the First Sociologist to Win NSF's Waterman Award<br/>Growing-up years gives scientist special lens on cultural and sibling inequalities<br/><br/>Alan T. Waterman Award <br/>Credit and Larger Version<br/>April 27, 2005<br/><br/><br/>When he was growing up in a New York City East Side neighborhood, Dalton Conley recognized the societal advantages of being a white male with middle-class values, even though his family was poor and his neighborhood was predominantly African-American and Latino.<br/><br/>At first, I had a heightened racial awareness. Class differences did not appear to have much impact on me at that age, and I'm not sure we had a language of class, Conley, a prominent New York University sociologist, says. But I did come to know the advantages that came to me because of being in a dominant racial group.<br/><br/>Today, the National Science Foundation (NSF), the independent federal agency that supports fundamental research across nearly all fields of science and engineering, recognized Conley as one of the nation's top young sociologists. The 35-year-old Conley will receive the 30th annual Alan T. Waterman Award, named for NSF's first director. It is the first time a sociologist has received the honor, which carries a $500,000 research award.<br/><br/>During college, Conley's interest in immunology was overtaken by his greater desire to understand broader societal puzzles, such as how socioeconomic status and advantage is transmitted through generations and how social inequality is reproduced by mechanisms such as wealth transfer, health and status at birth, racial makeup and changing family circumstances over time. He has been studying, writing and publishing ground-breaking works ever since in a direct and popular style that has heightened his impact among academic peers and raised the attention of policy makers.<br/><br/>Dr. Conley's work is the epitome of the kind of research that NSF vigorously supports, said Arden L. Bement, Jr., NSF director. His research is filled with new and untried ideas, carved into a creative path toward solving fundamental questions of society. He communicates his findings directly and eloquently, reaches varied audiences, and by so doing, opens new avenues of interest and study, not to mention he keeps government policy makers on their toes.<br/><br/>Last year, Conley, who is the director for NYU's Center for Social Science Research, published The Pecking Order, a book the Washington Post called lucid and provocative in its explanation of how the forces of income, gender, health and birth order in families result in a tangled web of inequalities that create a family's own pecking order.<br/><br/>We like to think of the family as a haven in harsh world - a level playing field, Conley said. But it's really more like a bubbling cauldron of inequality.<br/><br/>An NSF Faculty Early Career Award supported Conley's four-year study upon which the book, and other relatated papers, are based.<br/><br/>Conley has written several other books, including Being Black, Living in the Red, in which he shows that class dynamics since the Civil Rights era - specifically family wealth levels - appear to be the basis of persistent racial differences in areas of life ranging from educational success to the likelihood of relying on welfare. Race, however, continues to determine wealth levels, Conley argues. He believes it was his best work.<br/><br/>There was a very clear, simple study design that clearly showed how the inheritance of race and health differences manifest themselves into class differences that have long-lasting consequences, he said.<br/><br/>Conley's book, The Starting Gate: Birth Weight and Life Chances, extends the nature-or-nurture discussion by showing how biological and social factors combine to produce different life-chance outcomes of family members. It is a genes aren't everything argument that takes into account the interplay of multiple causal forces, regardless of their origination. For example, economic resources of a family can sometimes counteract biologically inherited effects, leading to different policy implications for truly at risk segments of society, that is, those who face both biological and social disadvantages.<br/><br/>I'm driven by empirical puzzles and other theoretical problems to solve, Conley says. Each book or article seems to lead to another piece of the puzzle. On the other hand, I'm also interested in larger-scale studies, integrating genetic and social research, for example. I'm interested in large-scale policy questions, doing large-scale, social-intervention experiments, using control groups, which dovetail into social and economic policy.'<br/><br/>-NSF-<br/>Media Contacts<br/>William C.

0524136	BioComp: Collaborative Research: P Systems: Theory and Applications to Modeling and Simulation of Cells	CCF	BIOLOGY & INFORMATION TECHNOLO	08/01/2005	05/08/2007	Oscar Ibarra	CA	University of California-Santa Barbara	Continuing grant	Mitra Basu	07/31/2010	$150,000.00		ibarra@cs.ucsb.edu	Office of Research	Santa Barbara	CA	931062050	8058934188	CSE	1705	9184, 9218, BIOT, HPCC	$0.00	Membrane computing, a relatively new branch of molecular computing, holds great promise for new paradigms for computation suggested by processes that occur in live cells. This area was recently selected by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) as a fast Emerging Research Front in Computer Science. The project has three major directions of research using tools and techniques from the membrane computing area. The first concerns the simulation of cells using concepts from P systems implemented in the E-cell package. To help the simulation of cells the second research area focuses on defining models of P systems that mimic the processes in the cell. The PIs have already, as a preliminary result, one such example of a model of P systems that has several features not found in any other previous P system models: binding of objects and genetic information. Another major novelty of the proposed model is that time is associated with each rule. The PIs plan to search for other suitable models, and also work on the more theoretical aspects of the P systems: developing efficient algorithms (e,g., considering reachability between system configurations), and investigating important and fundamental computational issues in the models considered. The third area complements the first two: research in the area of P systems simulators. While in the first area the interest is in simulating cells using, among other ideas, the models developed in the second area; the third research focus goes in the opposite direction - simulation of P systems rather than the simulation of cells. This area of research complements the first two, since such a simulator for a bio-relevant P system could answer practical questions raised from biology. An ambitious goal of the whole project is to capture in these mathematical models the way the cells self-configure and self-maintain and view it as computation. These investigations could yield new ideas and useful models for computation inspired by the extraordinary system that is a cell. The proposed project topic is new, with great promise to significantly impact several areas. In Biology the project will help explore, model and simulate differential gene expression during various biological processes and transcriptional and signaling networks on a larger scale than the current capabilities; in Computer Science the research could yield new paradigms and new computing techniques (as has happened in the discovery of genetic algorithms and neural networks). One of the major contributions of this project will be the applications of a good cell-simulator in many areas - such a software would be an invaluable tool for designing and testing new drugs; for predicting the behavior of a specific type of cell in a specific environment; and, lastly, for teaching and gaining more knowledge and insight about the extraordinary systems that we call the cells.

Research programs that will be supported by this instrument include a) metal catalysis and metal catalyzed synthesis of novel nucleoside entities, carcinogen-nucleoside adducts and studies on site-specifically modified DNA; b) selective vinyl and aryl fluorination, synthesis of specifically fluorinated hydrocarbons and their metabolites, studies of conformational and biological modulation by fluorine; c) fate of organic xenobiotics in the environment and elucidation of relevant reaction mechanisms; d) studies on ligand-protein interactions as well as synthetic drug-like molecules; e) structural studies of integral membrane proteins of medical relevance; and d) synthesis and studies of furanose-based novel ene-diyne antibiotic analogs. <br/><br/>Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an impact in a number of areas including environmental chemistry and synthetic chemistry.
0517987	Ecological dynamics in random environments	DMS	MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY	08/01/2005	07/19/2005	Sebastian Schreiber	VA	College of William and Mary	Standard Grant	Mary Ann Horn	10/31/2008	$102,709.00		sschreiber@ucdavis.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	Williamsburg	VA	231878795	7572213966	MPS	7334	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This project investigates the interplay of nonlinear dynamics and random abiotic fluctuations on distribution and abundance of interacting populations. To investigate this interplay, the theory of random dynamical systems which combines dynamical systems techniques with probabilistic machinery are applied to a class of random ecological maps sufficiently general to account for spatial structure, stage structure, and multispecies interactions. New mathematical methods for verifying stochastic dissipativeness, persistence, and extinction will be developed. The application of these methods to populations dispersing in random environments, the storage effect and the Allee effect in stage-structured populations, random replicator dynamics, and antagonistic interactions of ideal free populations in source-sink environments will be pursued. For models of structured populations, new methods will be developed for understanding monotonicity and convexity properties of the dominant Lyapunov exponent for parameterized families of random products of non-negative matrices. Since these dominant Lyapunov exponents determine the asymptotic growth rate of populations at low densities, they are critical for understanding persistence.<br/><br/>The interaction between environmental fluctuations, for example those due to anthropogenic disturbances or weather, and biological processes can dramatically affect the outcomes of species interactions. Consequently, the applications of the mathematical techniques developed in this project may be of practical value to the conservation or the restoration of ecological communities, the prevention of biological invasions, the management of natural resources, and biological control of agricultural pests.

The proposed program is a NIRT in the<br/>area of Nanoscale Structures, Novel Phenomena, and Quantum Control. The goal of this<br/>program is to develop technology to emit, manipulate, and detect single quanta. Only<br/>single-photon sources, single-photon detectors, beamsplitters, and phase shifters are<br/>necessary in order to build gates for efficient quantum computation. The PI proposes to<br/>improve the state-of-the-art in these components using a common chip-scale, indium<br/>phosphide compatible, approach. Single-photon sources developed at USC will be<br/>shared with the single-photon detector effort at UT Austin, and similarly, the singlephoton<br/>detectors developed at UT Austin will be shared with the single-photon source<br/>effort at USC. The collaboration will also ensure that the device designs will be<br/>compatible with the eventual integration onto a single InP substrate.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This proposed program will investigate both optically and electrically-pumped,<br/>single-mode, photonic crystal single-photon sources incorporating a single quantum dot<br/>emitting near 1.5 um. These sources will be coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide to<br/>facilitate chip-scale optical processing. Electronic circuits will be designed to drive these<br/>single-photon sources, sense the photon emission, and generate a trigger signal that can<br/>be used in subsequent gate timing. The single-photon detectors will be developed using<br/>Geiger mode avalanche photodiodes fabricated in InGaAs/InAlAs lattice matched to InP.<br/>While the long term goal is to develop a chip scale quantum gate technology applicable<br/>to quantum computation, this technology will find much nearer term applications in<br/>quantum cryptography.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research directions of this program will also impact the classroom teaching at<br/>both USC and the University of Texas. The investigators on this team teach 20 different<br/>undergraduate and graduate courses over the course of the proposed four-year program.<br/>There is also ongoing undergraduate participation in these research groups and the PI expects<br/>6 undergraduates to be involved in this project.
0509930	Differential-Geometric and Nonsmooth Methods in Deterministic Finite-Dimensional Control	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	07/01/2005	07/07/2005	Hector Sussmann	NJ	Rutgers University New Brunswick	Standard Grant	Mary Ann Horn	06/30/2009	$184,997.00		sussmann@math.rutgers.edu	33 Knightsbridge Road	Piscataway	NJ	088543925	8489320150	MPS	1266	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The project deals with research on mathematical problems belonging or related to deterministic, finite-dimensional nonlinear control theory, continuing the principal investigator's previous work in this area on a broad class of theoretical and applied questions, with the objective of solving fundamental open problems in optimal control (in particular on high-order nonsmooth necessary conditions for optimality, and optimal control with state space constraints) that pose significant mathematical challenges, and developing tools with a wide range of potential applications to new problems. The methods used will be those of differential-geometric control theory, especially geometrically intrinsic versions of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, theories of high-order optimality conditions, and nonsmooth analysis. The basic research strategy will be to use multivalued differentials, flows, and generalized abstract variations, as well as the theory of needle variations for almost lower semicontinuous set-valued maps. Possibly, the theory of real-analytic maps and their associated stratifications will play a role as well.<br/><br/>The questions to be studied in this work include large classes of optimization problems that occur in engineering and mechanical applications, such as: (a) control of robotic hands and other robotic systems, which mathematically amounts to path-finding for non-holonomic systems (that is, systems where one can directly control only a small number of directions, but one can effectively achieve motion in many other directions as well by combining the basic motions, as in the case of a car, which cannot move sideways but can be parked---as if it could move sideways---by combining forward and backward motions and turns), (b) control of chemical plants, which leads to problems involving so-called singular controls, (c) control of underwater vehicles (in work now in progress, that has already lead to one publication).
0503540	Oceans of Opportunity: Enhancing African-American Participation in the Marine Geosciences (Track 1)	GEO	OPPORT FOR ENHANCING DIVERSITY	07/01/2005	07/14/2008	Carol Pride	GA	Savannah State University	Standard Grant	Jill L.

Potential causes include lack of exposure to the geosciences at a young age, lack of continuous reinforcement in the geosciences, lack of participation in meaningful research, and lack of mentorship. The Oceans of Opportunity program will address all four of these potential causal factors in two focus cities (Savannah and Atlanta, GA) with high densities of African Americans in the public school systems and in the universities represented by the PIs (Savannah State University [SSU] and Georgia State University [GSU]). This collaboration between a primarily undergraduate HBCU (SSU) and a research university with significant minority enrollment (GSU) with outreach branches to the school systems is anchored by support from the Joint Oceanographic Institutions (JOI). Oceans of Opportunity focuses on sustained involvement of students in the marine geosciences from kindergarten through high school. Anticipated results are that these students will later appear in university geoscience courses and research laboratories.<br/> The Oceans of Opportunity program consists of two pipelines extending geoscience research and academic endeavors from the universities and JOI to the public school systems. In the Track 1 research pipeline, research training groups (RTG) have been established at SSU to carry out research on the record of carbon storage and availability of natural resources in the nearby South Atlantic Bight (SAB), and on the history of Gulf Stream flow through study of sediment cores from the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 164 and 171 (Blake Ridge and Blake Nose). In support of RTG development and focused SAB/Gulf Stream research, funding for one graduate student and one undergraduate per year is provided. High school students in a pilot marine science course hosted by the Savannah-Chatham School District's Oatland Island Education Center round out the RTG. <br/> In the Track 2 academic pipeline, Oceans of Opportunity is developing and implementing three of six planned interactive geoscience modules based on actual sediment samples from deep ocean drilling, replicas of ODP cores, and innovative lesson plans that expand use of these materials for students of all academic levels.

Models that are created to represent the hinging behavior in reinforced concrete systems, and the resulting understanding of this behavior under different loading conditions, have traditionally been limited by the ability to validate the model with experimental data - either from pre-existing bridge structures with inadequate access to internal reinforcement, or from component tests that are unable to simulate realistic boundary conditions. The validation of these detailed models is now possible with the data that will be collected during the NEESR project CMS-0420347 investigation of the seismic performance of four-span large-scale bridge systems, which includes the soil-foundation-structure interaction effects at the footings and abutments, at the NEES equipment site at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR). The proposed NEESR payload research will be conducted in two parts: (1) small additions to the existing experimental procedure of the UNR NEESR team in the form of additional instrumentation, non-invasive photogrammetric methods, and additional input ground motions (at low level excitation), and (2) an analytical investigation of the effects of joint and foundation flexibility and load history on the control of plastic hinging locations in bridge systems. The specific goals of the project are the following: (1) accurately track the deformations in the hinging region and beam-column joints using traditional reinforcement and concrete gages as well as photogrammetric methods, (2) create a bridge system model using OpenSees that captures the joint deformations and spread of plasticity in the column elements under different levels of excitation, (3) compare deformations captured using traditional gages with those determined using photogrammetric methods, (4) perform parametric analysis of bridge systems with varied stiffness and strength properties to determine the effect on inelastic behavior, component, and system performance, (5) recommend simple techniques for calculating the drift response of bridge systems considering joint flexibility and more accurate plastic hinge behavior, and (6) engage graduate and undergraduate students through content in graduate courses and participation by telepresence during the testing phases of the project. Intellectual Merit: This proposal addresses the estimation of element and system level inelastic deformations considering the impact of joint and foundation flexibility for reinforced concrete bridge systems subjected to various strong ground motion demands. As part of this work, an improved joint model for reinforced concrete bridge systems will be developed for the OpenSees platform. The drift response of structural systems will be estimated with a better understanding of the contributions of joint flexibility and inelastic behavior in the elements. Broader Impacts: This project broadens the focus of a NEESR award that evaluates soil-foundation-structure interaction of reinforced concrete bridge systems and new hinging devices, to the contributions of joint flexibility to the development and the location of hinging in bridge elements. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the work through telepresence during testing and through graduate coursework.

The research focuses on the early stages of the process where people interpret the question asked and search for relevant information. The meaning making process is revealed through a comparison of how people answer assertion questions (e.g., I am happy) and negation questions (e.g., I am not sad) that have the same semantic implication. The PIs' earlier research demonstrates that (a) respondents endorse assertions more than negations and do so more quickly, (b) wide individual differences occur in this Endorsement Bias, and (c) personality scales often confound item type (i.e., assertion or negation) with the direction the item is scored. This research aims to identify the processes that produce this bias and technologies than can be used to eliminate its effects from self-reports. Many of the studies use the advanced statistical sophistication of Item Response Theory to identify the differences in meaning of semantically similar questions. This research will improve survey methodology, performance appraisal, and other forms of self-report information.

Estimating the luminosity function from magnitude-limited samples is straightforward if the objects have accurately known distances, but much more difficult when distances are only approximate, or only well known for a small subset of the sample. This occurs, for example, when photometric redshifts are available, but spectroscopic redshifts are not. This research will develop algorithms to handle this complication, and to cope with the effects of these uncertainties on correlations of intrinsic properties. The developed algorithms will be used to interpret data from galaxy and quasar surveys that are just becoming available.<br/><br/>These methods will impact a broad range of astronomical studies, including nearby galaxies with marked peculiar velocities, and stellar luminosity functions when accurate parallax distances are not available. Since the work blends theory and data analysis over a three year timeline, it is also well suited for a doctoral thesis project, and every effort will be made to enlist a capable graduate student from an under-represented group.

Mosher to work with Dr. David C. Baulcombe at John Innes Centre in Norwich, United Kingdom.<br/><br/>RNA-mediated gene silencing, also known as co-suppression, quelling, or RNA interference, is an important genetic regulatory mechanism. The best studied form of RNA-mediated silencing is post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), in which short interfering RNA (siRNA) guide RISC (RNA interference specificity complex) to cleave any mRNA with sequence homology to siRNAs. siRNAs also direct a less understood form of RNA-mediated gene silencing, RNA-directed chromatin modification (RDCM). During RDCM, DNA with homology to siRNAs is methylated, causing a reduction in transcription. Histone H3 is also methylated in response to siRNAs, specifically at lysine 9 (K9), commonly the mark of inert heterochromatin. Through chromatin modification and perhaps other nuclear events, RDCM reinforces PTGS and may also have a developmental function. Genetic screens in Arabidopsis have made deep inroads toward discovering the machinery driving PTGS. In comparison, relatively little is known of the mechanism and associated proteins of RDCM. In specific aim 1 of this proposal, the PI will use mutant analysis to uncover novel <br/>components of RDCM. A genetic screen using the PVX-GFP silencing system has uncovered 30 new RDCM mutations falling into at least five complementation groups. These mutations will be cloned using traditional map-based techniques. The natural role of RDCM is also unclear and few endogenous targets have been identified. In specific aim 2, the PI will identify endogenous targets of RDCM using a modified AFLP procedure followed by siRNA analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation.<br/><br/>The Baulcombe group at the Sainsbury laboratory has been pioneers in the field of RNA-mediated silencing and have successfully used genetic analysis to uncover novel elements in RDCM. The Sainsbury Laboratory and greater John Innes Centre is a world-class facility with the equipment and support staff to make this project a success. This project has significant intellectual potential in a number of areas, including basic biology, evolutionary biology, and gene therapy.

The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.<br/><br/>This award will support a twenty-two-month research fellowship by Dr. Kevin Rowe, who will collaborate with Prof. Peter Baversotck at Southern Cross University in New South Wales, Australia and Prof. Craig Moritz, director of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and affiliate of the Center for Integrative Genomics at the University of California, Berkeley. <br/><br/>The genus Rattus, originating in Southeast Asia, is one the fastest expanding organisms and is widespread throughout every continent except Antarctica. Few organisms have as much contact with and significance to human populations; Rattus are critical vectors for disease, major crop pests, and important biological models for physiological, toxicological and medical studies. Like other rodents, Rattus have prolific reproductive rates, and have perhaps the greatest propensity for population expansion and invasion of any rodent. The nature of Rattus is one of expansion and diversification. To understand the success and spread of this organism we must evaluate its expansions, adaptations and diversification. This project investigates population expansions, adaptive divergence, and reproductive isolation (diversification) among two closely related Australian Rattus species. Australia is an important location to begin the investigation of the expansions of the genus Rattus as it represents a terminal expansion point near the origin of Rattus in Southeast Asia. This project utilizes the recently completed genome of Rattus norvegicus to evaluate genetic changes resulting from the recent expansion and reproductive isolation of two species of Rattus in Australia. Comparisons of the genomes of humans, Mus (mouse), and Rattus, demonstrate that the vast majority of functional differences in protein sequences are limited to immunological proteins, toxicity proteins, and olfactory/odorant proteins. The recent evolution and divergence of Australian Rattus provide a unique opportunity to apply genomic information from the Rattus norvegicus genome to address fundamental evolutionary questions. Prof. Baverstock is expert on the evolution of Australian Rattus, particularly the genetic basis of reproductive isolation. Prof. Moritz provides extensive computational skills and advanced infrastructure for genomic analyses. Thus, this project fosters the exchange of ideas between these distinguished scientists and supports transfer of this information to Dr. Rowe that will be the foundation for his academic career in the United States.

In addition, our partner campuses in the NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center: Center Of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems will have access to this unique resource. It offers a combination of advanced microscopy techniques employed for hard materials, such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS), with the cryogenic specimen preparation and handling capabilities necessary for working with soft materials. It will also expand the scope of existing nanotechnology collaborative projects with industrial partners such as Hewlett-Packard. Specifically, the requested cryoultramicrotome will permit rapid freezing and sectioning of hard-soft specimens for TEM and SEM analysis without disruption of internal structures and interfaces that occur with common specimen preparation methods involving dehydration. The cryotransfer stage requested will allow transfer of these specimens into the TEM without warming and, in addition, allow them to be held at liquid nitrogen temperatures during analysis. This capability is critical for soft materials since it decreases specimen damage rates by a factor of 4-10X and prevents carbon migration to the electron beam position that makes microanalysis by thickness-sensitive techniques, such as EELS, otherwise nearly impossible. The combination of EELS, which is highly sensitive to light elements and does not require soft materials to be preferentially stained by heavy elements that introduce artifacts, with cryomicroscopy will enable nanoscale analysis of hard-soft materials in their native state. An XEDS detector has also been requested to complement our existing EELS capabilities. The requested instrumentation will enhance undergraduate teaching and research, in addition to outreach efforts. It will also assist in recruiting highly qualified faculty for our new undergraduate majors in bioengineering (introduced in 2005) and chemistry, materials chemistry, materials science and engineering, and physics (to be introduced in 2006). FTEs for these faculty hires have specifically been allocated in a manner to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration, with soft or soft-hard materials identified as a research focus for all but one of these majors. <br/><br/><br/>Combining very small-scale soft materials (polymers and biological materials) and hard materials (semiconductors, ceramics, and metals) leads to development of new technology for applications in human health, the environment; new energy; electronics; and aeronautics requires devices that. In order to understand how these devices work and to enable their development, an electron microscope and specimen preparation equipment are required that can study both the hard and soft components. We propose to combine very cold specimen preparation and holding techniques used for soft specimens with analysis techniques used for hard materials in order to achieve this. Our microscopy facility serves all researchers at our university in the physical sciences, engineering, and biology, and includes undergraduate research and teaching. For example, undergraduate students from our first freshman engineering class (entering in 2005) are already engaged in a microscopy research project that will require them to use these tools. Our students will incorporate their results into an exhibit that they are building for a local science museum serving area middle school students. The results will also be used for a technology education website that the students are developing. This website will in turn be used for interactive technology demonstrations by faculty visiting area middle and high schools.

Such universities cast a wide net. Large merit <br/>awards draw a few students with sterling high school records while thousands <br/>arrive each year having, for whatever reason, not amassed the high SAT/ACT <br/>scores and leadership roles needed to gain admission to highly selective <br/>institutions. Sifting through the latter group reveals a small but significant <br/>number with latent high mathematical talent. These 'sleeper' students come to <br/>life during their first exposure to abstract math, and their work in advanced <br/>courses can match or exceed that of their peers who excelled in high school. A <br/>strong departmental honors program can be the framework that identifies and <br/>supports this diverse group, drawing on the department's graduate and research <br/>resources as it guides them as rapidly as possible through the transition to <br/>advanced abstract and applied mathematics.<br/><br/>The University of Tennessee Math Honors Program provides early identification <br/>of talent, a flexible curriculum that places undergraduates in graduate <br/>courses as early as the sophomore year, an honors seminar, and significant <br/>mentoring and advising. The program draws on the surrounding rural Appalachian <br/>region, providing opportunity to students who may have received little support <br/>and stimulation in high school for their mathematical abilities. More than 75% <br/>of the grant is devoted to direct financial support to students in the form of <br/>merit and need-based scholarships, research stipends and summer tuition <br/>remission. Scholarships will be awarded to a few incoming freshmen, but mainly <br/>to current UT students who decide to follow an accelerated track through the <br/>honors program. University cost sharing of close to 10% of the grant total <br/>will allow the program to offer multi-year scholarships extending beyond the <br/>five-year term of the grant. Additional funding supports graduate students as <br/>summer research mentors for undergraduates, administration and assessment of <br/>the program. A 'math ambassadors' program funded by the grant will send honors <br/>students to high schools to increase interest in mathematics in general and <br/>the UT Math Honors program in particular. The funding is expected increase the <br/>size of the UT Math Honors program by more than 50%.
0520989	MRI: Acquisition of Bipedal Robot Facility to Support Research into Improvement of Orientation and Stability of Locomotion	CNS	MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION	08/01/2005	08/31/2010	Simon Parsons	NY	CUNY Brooklyn College	Standard Grant	Rita V. Rodriguez	07/31/2011	$212,625.00	Frank Grasso, Theodore Raphan	parsons@sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu	Office of Research & Sponsored P	Brooklyn	NY	112102889	7189515622	CSE	1189	9135, 9218, HPCC	$0.00	This project, enhancing a humanoid bipedal robot with vestibular and vision sensors, aims at creating Bipedal Robot Facility for research on making robots walk in a dynamically stable, and thus more human fashion. The ability to keep gaze concentrated on a point of interest during continuous bipedal locomotion (when the body might pitch, yaw, or roll in response to uneven terrain) is an automatic function that humans perform rather efficiently. Modeling the fundamental sensorimotor strategies associated with head and body control during walking and turning has led to understanding basic human functions. Bipedal robots are expected to maneuver more efficiently over uneven terrain; however, such terrain is extremely challenging. The next generation of robot vehicles will have to operate in conditions that require gaits that involve dynamic stability; thus, serious consideration needs to be given to dynamically stable motion stabilization. This work utilizes gaze stabilization as a control strategy for a dynamically stable gait, a difficult unsolved problem in robotics. This strategy is supported by recent psychological research. To date even the most advanced legged-robots do not attempt to combine this type of sensory information. The team consisting of two computer scientists and a psychology researcher hypothesizes, based on extensive work in human locomotion, that doing so will have a revolutionary effect on the stability of the robot gait. Mimicking the sensory capability of a wide range of animals-including humans, birds, kangaroos, reptiles like the basilisk-and the way that these animals use this sensory capacity, the project aims at improving the bipedal robot gaits. Moreover, the research will be enhanced by three longer projects:<br/>-Building humanoid robots that can walk quickly over uneven terrain while maintaining stability and performing a human-like gait;<br/>-Understanding human gait; and<br/>-Designing prostheses that can help humans who are otherwise unable to attain a normal gait due to pathologies such as Parkinson's disease.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Active collaboration with other faculty in CS and neurology at many campuses encourage effective multi-disciplinary and multi-entitity use of the instrumentation. Reaching many students, the robots will be used as demonstration systems in three classes. Moreover, an early High School program for participation for math and science, involving minorities, is in place. OpenPINO, a center of a linux-like open-source user community, and a Web-site encourage dissemination.

This threat requires close observation, forecasting capabilities, and policy decisions. Accountable detection, attribution, and verification of greenhouse gas and aerosol sources and sinks are required. Such verification relies on the quantification of air-sea exchange of greenhouse gases and aerosols, both at the regional and global levels. In the wake of the Kyoto agreement, the political imperative for monitoring greenhouse gases is running well ahead of scientific understanding. The new international research initiative on the Surface Ocean-Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS, sponsored by IGBP/SCOR/CACGP/WCRP) aims to achieve quantitative understanding of key biogeochemical-physical interactions and feedbacks between the ocean and the atmosphere, while understanding how this coupled system affects and is affected by climate, weather and environmental change.<br/><br/>This award to Columbia University will provide travel and logistical support for sixteen U.S. students, three lecturers, and two technicians to participate in the 2nd International SOLAS Summer School to be held in 2005 (http://www.uea.ac.uk/env/solas/summerschool/). The School brings young researchers in contact with leading scientists of different components of SOLAS research. The school uses a theoretical framework, practical exercises, and laboratory experiments to promote an enhanced learning environment. Most importantly, the school provides the opportunity for young researchers interested in SOLAS science issues to meet one another and to form alliances capable of addressing the significant future challenges that face the field and society. It is our current new scientists who are most likely to meet the challenges of solving significant Earth system problems. For this reason, interaction between the US and other international scientific communities in this field must be strengthened and promoted. The school forges the necessary bonds between maturing scientists of different nationalities and backgrounds, which will be carried forward as these students become, themselves, leaders in the field.

Ardell	07/31/2008	$351,000.00		alexking@ameslab.gov	Young Hall	West Lafayette	IN	479072114	7654941055	MPS	1771	1711, 9161, AMPP	$0.00	TECHNICAL: This project addresses structure-property relationships in polycrystalline thin films, and will seek to exploit the intrinsic structural anisotropy that exists when the films have columnar structures. In these films, grains, grain boundaries, phase boundaries (if they exist), and triple junctions all can be made to extend from the bottom of the film to the top, and therefore provide continuous paths across the film. Some of these paths, however, can be disconnected in the plane of the film: isolated grains of one phase and/or interfacial triple-junctions do not form a continuous path in the plane of the film. When these structural components can be engineered to be the active paths for electron transport, for example, the film will be conductive through its thickness, but not in its plane. A number of other potential applications of isolated columnar structural elements are conceivable, including the low-cost manufacture of large areas covered with field-emitter tips, for use in display systems. The project seeks, first, to develop suitable processing methods to create columnar microstructures with application potential, using two different strategies. The first strategy is the creation of two-phase films, using a binary eutectic alloy system. The goal here is to create a system in which one of the phases forms isolated columns that can be used for a variety of purposes, depending upon the properties that can be associated with the phase in the columns. The second strategy is the creation of columnar active regions by doping the regions defined by triple junctions, in an originally single-phase film. These two strategies are likely to provide differing opportunities for microstructural control, and will also be varyingly applicable in different materials systems. Our exemplar for the first strategy will be the Cu-Ag eutectic system, and for the second strategy we will base our development on films of LiF. Significant new findings are expected relative to the processing and microstructural control of both of these thin film systems. Controllable films with distinct columnar phases or compositional regions (which we identify generically as .components.) will enable the exploration of a number of attractively simple structure-property relationship hypotheses, and the testing of these hypotheses will be an important component of this research. <br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL: The project will train two PhD students in advanced processing-structure-property relationships, providing a very sound training for all of materials science, addressing both modeling and experimentation. In addition, as many as twelve undergraduate students may be involved in the research project through summer research programs, or special topics research courses as part of their undergraduate programs. The selection of students for these opportunities will be based upon existing programs at Purdue University, which have significant outreach to minorities and women. The demonstration of fundamentally simple ideas for the creation of special properties via microstructural control is likely to provide a number of opportunities for informal education and outreach, that will be fully exploited in the recruitment of students into the Materials Engineering program at Purdue, and also in presentations to the general public. Strong relationships with the microelectronics industry will ensure that novel properties such as anisotropic electrical conductivity, optoelectronic properties, and others, will be exploited efficiently.

While elastic shells can exhibit great strength, their behaviors can also be very difficult to predict and they can fail in a catastrophic fashion. Despite many experiences accumulated in the engineering literature, the mathematical theory of shells is still being developed, and there is not a single numerical method that is provably reliable. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is numerical methods for a variety of parameter-dependent models including thickness-dependent linear elastic shell equations. The resulting methods will yield solutions that are uniformly accurate with respect to the parameter. A shell structure could be bending-dominated, membrane-dominated, or intermediate, reflecting its load-bearing ability. The main efforts of this project will be devoted to the intermediate shell problems whose solution exhibits the most elusive behavior and ever-increasing singularity as the shell thickness becomes small. Moreover, most realistic shell structures are of this kind. The resulting methods will be directly applicable to membrane-dominated shells, and will be helpful for satisfactorily solving bending-dominated shells to which most of the numerical analyses have been devoted. Aside from shell problems, we also study anisotropic heat conduction, beam-string deformation, and the Reissner-Mindlin plate bending model with a big twisting moment loaded on the plate boundary. Under suitable conditions, these problems have features resembling those of intermediate shells, which are often left open in the literature.<br/><br/>Shell problems are practically important, mathematically interesting, and computationally challenging. The project will result in numerical methods that are valuable for practitioners. There are interdisciplinary connections with engineering and other applied mathematics and scientific computing disciplines, and with industry.

It consists of three major components that form an integrated strategy to recruit, train, and mentor underrepresented students. The goal is to get underrepresented students to enter graduate school and a geoscience career. The first component of the project targets underrepresented incoming freshman and community college transfer students. It is coordinated with existing UC Davis programs designed to enhance the success of underrepresented students, and it recruits minorities into small-enrollment seminars that provide focused geoscience education on a specific topic, introduces students to research, and provides personalized mentoring. The second component consists of an intensive research experience, which immerses beginning undergraduates in the scientific process and conveys the relevance of the geosciences to the individual student. The research program involves interaction of four to seven students and a mentor in an active monitoring program of water quality and sedimentation in Putah Creek, which flows through the UC Davis Arboretum. The Putah Creek experience is designed to teach students the skills necessary to perform individual research projects, provide them with opportunities to pursue research projects more specific to their interests, and define their own scientific questions that can form the basis of a senior thesis. The third component of the project is a three-pronged, course-based mentoring and advising initiative consisting of two professional skill development courses ('Building Your Professional Toolbox', and 'Selling Science'), the aim of which is to increase retention and professional development of underrepresented students.

These systems have found many applications in diverse<br/>areas such as multiple space, air, and land vehicles, energy systems, physiology, and medicine. Currently,<br/>there is an active research effort underway in the control and systems community to formalize these systems<br/>and lay out a foundation for their analysis and synthesis. The objective of this project is to carry out foundational<br/>studies on a network-centric input-output and robustness analysis framework for distributed dynamic<br/>systems. The approach adopted for this purpose is based on algebraic graph theory on one hand, and random<br/>and random geometric graphs, on the other. In this direction, we will address problems associated<br/>with probabilistic moments of system-theoretic objective functionals over uncertain networks, as well as<br/>the important phenomena associated with time-scales and phase transitions in robustness and performance<br/>measures of the corresponding networked systems. An existing computational testbed at the University of<br/>Washington will be augmented for the purpose of validation and evaluation of the proposed methodologies.<br/>Education Plan: Distributed dynamic systems provide an ideal venue to engage control and systems graduate<br/>students in the elegance and power of system ideas, not only as they pertain to engineering problems,<br/>but also in their relation to biology and information sciences. The education program of this project is<br/>implemented through a graduate course offering and curriculum development, graduate mentoring, and promoting<br/>research collaboration venues via in-class seminars and a workshop. The proposed course, Networkcentric<br/>Dynamic System Theory and Applications, will be developed and offered as a two quarters graduate<br/>level course in the controls curriculum of the University of Washington. The course will cover aspects of<br/>combinatorial theory that, in conjunction with system theory, have proved instrumental in the analysis of<br/>network-enabled dynamic systems. The second quarter of the course provides a rigorous bridge between<br/>system theory and networked dynamic systems as encountered in a wide array of disciplines such as in biology<br/>and physiology. The workshop on network-centric dynamic systems during the final year of the project<br/>will not only serve as an exceptional educational outlet for the graduate students, but also as a vehicle to<br/>further enhance opportunities for interdisciplinary research.<br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed research and education program consists of:<br/>(1) foundational contributions to a new sub-discipline in control theory referred to as network-centric dynamic<br/>system theory (2) applying novel graph and system theoretic techniques for the analysis of networked<br/>dynamic systems as encountered in life and physical sciences and engineering systems (3) providing a significant<br/>impetus for collaborations between system and control theorists, combinatorialists, biologists, and<br/>physicists, at the University of Washington, and (4) development of a new curriculum for graduate program<br/>in systems and control education.<br/>Broader Impact: Our project will lay a fertile ground work for future collaborations between system and<br/>control researchers, graph theorists, and the biological science community. By doing so, it will also bring<br/>into the horizon a host of new career options for system and control graduate students. Our contributions to<br/>the emerging field of networks will be well publicized via: (1) a well-organized workshop on the third year<br/>of the project, bringing researchers from across disciplines, from local computer science, engineering, and<br/>biomedical industries (2) presenting research results, often by graduate students, in professional conferences<br/>and research institutions, and (3) frequent seminars in the educational institutions that are non-Ph.D granting<br/>and/or serve underrepresented groups. These more public seminars will highlight the common complexities<br/>of networked dynamic systems across various disciplines, and how control and system theory is providing<br/>novel theoretical and algorithmic tools for their analysis and synthesis. These seminars will also be actively<br/>used as a recruitment tool, particularly for attracting potential graduate students from underrepresented<br/>groups in engineering.

Consequently,<br/>complexity management has become an essential part of control systems design. An<br/>emerging approach to controlling such systems consists of a decomposition of the<br/>control actions into a sequence of modes, each of which is defined for a<br/>particular task, operating point, or data source. The central question is how to<br/>schedule the various modes in order to optimize the system's performance.<br/>Related questions concern the development of real-time algorithms for<br/>performance improvement and the tradeoff between the size of the mode set and<br/>the system's performance.<br/><br/>This project will answer the above questions by casting them in the setting of<br/>optimal control, by combining techniques from hybrid systems, motion description<br/>languages, and numerical optimization. This new approach to controlling complex<br/>systems will advance the state of the art of supervisory controller design by<br/>providing effective algorithms for off-line computation of optimal controls, and<br/>for real-time implementation of suboptimal controls.<br/><br/>On the technological side, the framework for optimal timing control of<br/>multi-modal systems has far-reaching implications in a variety of application<br/>domains. For instance, optimal scheduling of robotic tasks can be crucial for<br/>the success of autonomous planetary explorations, mine sweeping,<br/>search-and-rescue applications, and other military missions. On the educational<br/>side, a new controls curriculum will be developed at the Georgia Institute of<br/>Technology that combines computer-science techniques with the traditional<br/>approach to signals and systems.

Upwelling is a defining factor of El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) in the eastern Pacific, particularly along the coast of Peru. Historical records of this phenomenon are limited and older proxy records in this region are few. The proposal will exploit the ventilation age difference between equatorial surface and deeper upwelled waters. The detection of El Nino events will be made by screening for shell increment alteration and by sequential d18O analysis. The simultaneous excursions in d 18O and D14C in molluscan shell identify periods of upwelling variation caused by El Ninos. By providing data of Peruvian Holocene upwelling this project will provide understanding of paleo-ENSO and give insight into past deep water circulation. Furthermore, the large increase in the database of regional D R data will improve age-dating in many disciplines. Broader impacts of this research also include graduate and undergraduate student training through participation in all stages of research.

A heightened emphasis on national security and assured access to space for defense have added impetus to industry and government support for SpaceTEC. New commercial space ventures such as the flight of SpaceShipOne are opening new opportunities requiring multi-skilled technicians with broad competencies. As the President's Exploration Initiative seeks to return Americans to the moon and send manned missions to Mars, SpaceTEC directly addresses these needs, providing the only industry-based, academically approved national aerospace education and certification programs for the technicians of the future.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: SpaceTEC operates in an environment that includes rapid technology changes and growing global competition. SpaceTEC's vision is to be a focal point promoting careers in aerospace, engaging students in science and technology, and providing ways to reduce costs and avoid problems. SpaceTEC supports industry in preparing for the changing aerospace workplace by providing programs, courses, and competencies needed for the multi-skilled technician of the future. SpaceTEC's multi-faceted alliance has created a national infrastructure comprising industry, labor, government and academic partners matching local technical education needs with nationally-standardized skill sets. Stakeholder support is substantial and is expected to grow even greater (e.g., FAA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with SpaceTEC in October 2004).

This project will carry out a one hundred square degree multi-band optical survey of the southern sky, in conjunction with even deeper images of smaller fields, coordinated with a millimeter-wave survey that will map the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to detect galaxy clusters out to moderate redshifts. These coordinated surveys will enable the most precise cosmological study to date with galaxy clusters, and will enable complementary studies of the dark energy using supernova distances, cosmic shear, and the galaxy power spectrum. This research will use the NSF-supported Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, and the privately supported Magellan telescope, both operational in Chile, and the CMB data will come from the NSF-funded South Pole Telescope, currently under construction.<br/><br/>The key science question of the dark energy has already engaged significant public interest. This research will leverage the scientific productivity of multiple NSF-funded facilities, break new ground in real-time image analysis and observing optimization, directly benefit future large surveys currently in the planning stages, and continue a tradition of graduate and undergraduate student participation.
0533968	Collaborative Research: From Edge Pixels to Recognition of Parts of Object Contours	IIS	COMPUTER VISION	07/15/2005	07/14/2005	Zygmunt Pizlo	IN	Purdue University	Standard Grant	Jie Yang	09/30/2008	$105,418.00		pizlo@psych.purdue.edu	Young Hall	West Lafayette	IN	479072114	7654941055	CSE	7339	7495, 9215, HPCC	$0.00	Object recognition in Computer Vision, though being a main processing step in many tasks of robotics, surveillance, and other fields of automation, is still an unsolved problem. The recent results in human visual perception strongly suggest that contour extraction is a key step to object recognition. A development of a contour-based system for object recognition is proposed. The first step of the new approach concentrates on extraction of object contours from edge images that correspond to contours as perceived by humans. Since the extraction of complete contours may not be possible (e.g., due to occlusion), extraction is focused on meaningful parts of contours. The proposed approach uses a mixture of bottom up and top down processing for edge grouping. After each step of bottom-up processing in a pyramid architecture, top-down evaluation is applied to select the most promising grouping constellations. A promising grouping constellation is defined using cognitively motivated constraints. In accord with the cognitive simplicity principle known from Gestalt psychology, partial shape similarity will be used as a primary building block of such constraints. In accord with the newest results in human perception, grouping of edges to parts of object contours and recognition of the parts using shape similarity play a key role in object recognition. This means that object recognition is possible if only part of a contour is constructed, and the construction of the whole contour is not necessary for recognition. In particular, object recognition works in the presence of occlusion and segmentation errors. <br/><br/> The proposed solution to the object recognition problem can make a significant step to improve the application scope of vision systems. The results of this work will be applicable to vision systems, large image databases, and video analysis systems. The proposed research to find interdependence and structural information among visual parts may lead to further understanding of human visual perception and cognition. The proposed research will provide an excellent resource for interdisciplinary work for graduate and undergraduate students in computer science and psychology. The PIs will offer courses and seminars on proposed research topics that will bring the state-of-the-art knowledge and technology to the classrooms.

Decades of extensive research on the cichlid fishes inhabiting the great rift lakes of East Africa have provided science with one of the clearest examples of evolution leading to the generation ecological diversity. In the Western Hemisphere, the family Cichlidae ranges from Texas to Argentina, and species display a very broad array of ecological, morphological, and behavioral traits. Unfortunately, evolutionary relationships among major groups of Neotropical cichlids are incompletely resolved, making modern quantitative assessment of ecological diversification impossible. This research project uses nucleotide sequences from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in combination with a set of morphological characters to investigate relationships within and between two species-rich and ecologically diverse lineages of cichlid fishes. The resultant evolutionary model will be used as a framework for examining patterns of ecological diversification (adaptive radiation) in this important group of fishes. Studies of adaptive radiation and convergence require the integration of information from phylogeny, ecology, and morphology. This study integrates such information for cichlid fishes in the Western Hemisphere, a group that holds great promise for providing a second model system for the study of adaptive radiation. <br/><br/>Cichlid fishes have great economic importance, because they support major commercial, subsistence, and recreational fisheries throughout the Western Hemisphere. Many species are also important in the aquarium fish industry worldwide. New ecological and molecular data on cichlid fishes will be made available to the scientific community as databases on permanent websites. The project also has major educational components. Undergraduate students enrolled in two NSF training grants will participate in field research in Latin America and laboratory research related to evolutionary or ecological components of this grant. Graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher also will receive training through participation in the project. Activities and results of this research will be disseminated through scientific publications, websites, and resources associated with the Center for Application of Informational Technology in Teaching and Learning Science, an NSF-funded program that emphasizes web-based techniques for enhancing K-12 science education.

Neutral atoms that have been laser cooled and stored in optical traps have low decoherence rates and are well suited for storing quantum information in the form of qubits. In order to transfer information between macroscopically separated neutral atom qubits the information can be mapped onto photons that are emitted by one atom and detected by the receiving atom. As individual atoms have small cross sections for photon generation and detection we have proposed and will demonstrate coupling of single atoms to mesoscopic many atom qubits, followed by efficient generation of photonic qubits by the mesoscopic ensemble. The emitted photon is then detected by a receiving ensemble, which is in turn coupled to a single atom qubit. Combining these elements will enable a quantum channel that connects single atom qubits. The quantum channel can be used for transmitting quantum information and for creating distant bell states that can be used for teleportation of the atomic states. <br/><br/>Our experimental approach is based on using single atoms as well as ensembles of atoms stored at high densities in optical traps. The atoms are laser cooled to kinetic energies of a few micro Kelvins. Coherent laser techniques are used for qubit manipulation as well as excitation of strongly interacting Rydberg states. The Rydberg states are used to couple information between single atoms and many atom ensembles. Coherent manipulation of the ensembles with several laser beams results in deterministic emission of photons in a desired direction. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is in the study and demonstration of many particle entanglement. The presence of entanglement provides a sharp distinction between classical and quantum phenomena, and is fundamental to the computational power of quantum mechanical systems. This research will extend our ability to create and harness entanglement for controlling the flow of information and will demonstrate the possibility of entangling single atom qubits with mesocopic qubits.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed activity will include contributions to the development of quantum techniques for computing and communication. These quantum mechanical approaches have the potential for unprecedented computational power, as well as secure transmission of information. In addition the research to be performed at The University of Wisconsin - Madison will expose undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers to state of the art techniques and tools, and train them to contribute to the technological and scientific development of society. We have consistently had strong involvement of undergraduate students in our research on this topic and will continue to do so in the proposed work.

Quantum phenomena, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, make possible protocols that are difficult or impossible using classical resources. A better understanding of measurement and entanglement, therefore, can be expected to yield a better understanding of existing QIP protocols, and hopefully lead to the development of new protocols as well. This proposal approaches this by studying sequences of weak measurements, and the behavior of quantum systems under them.<br/><br/>In quantum mechanics, systems evolve in time by two very different processes: by unitary evolution according to the Schrdinger equation, and by measurement. Unitary evolution is continuous, reversible, and deterministic; it is the evolution that quantum systems undergo when they are not observed. By contrast, measurement (in its usual form) is discontinuous, irreversible, and random. A measurement provides some information about the state of a quantum system; but at the same time, it disturbs the state of the system. There is a close relationship between acquiring information and disturbing the system; if a measurement yields a certain amount of information, it must disturb the state by at least a certain amount.<br/><br/>A more recent idea is that of a weak measurement: a measurement that disturbs the system only slightly, but provides only a very small amount of information. By repeatedly doing weak measurements, more and more information can be accumulated (and the disturbance grows progressively greater and greater). In fact, the PI has recently shown that any measurement can be decomposed into a sequence of weak measurements, in a way that has the structure of a random walk: the state of the system shifts randomly back and forth towards the possible outcomes of the measurement, and at long times is guaranteed to approach one or another of the outcomes with a given probability. In the limit, this is like a diffusion process, with the state diffusing continuously (but randomly) along a curve in the space of all possible states.<br/><br/>Using this technique, it is possible to make continuous processes that previously were discrete. This means that the techniques of differential calculus can be brought to bear on certain outstanding problems in quantum information processing. One very promising area is entanglement. Entanglement is a type of quantum correlation, which is stronger (in certain ways) than any classical correlation; it is a resource for a number of quantum protocols, such as teleportation and dense coding. For this reason, there has been a great deal of interest in finding good quantitative measures of entanglement. This problem is largely solved for one class of systems (bipartite pure states); but for others, little is known. An idea that has proven very fruitful is that of an entanglement monotone: a function of the state that always decreases on average under purely local operations. It has been difficult to investigate these quantities systematically; using weak measurement decompositions, one can find differential conditions for monotones, and open up a brand new avenue to the problem of entanglement.<br/><br/>In addition to the classical random walks that occur in these measurement procedures, there are purely quantum analogues of random walks, called quantum walks. Unlike the random walks, these are purely unitary evolutions, which are currently of great interest as possibly leading to new types of quantum algorithms. This project will also study quantum walks on graphs, with particular emphasis on the effects of decoherence (quantum noise) and other imperfections, to assess how well such new algorithms might be expected to perform under realistic conditions.

The rocks that lie on these microcontinents contain older (Precambrian-age) igneous and sedimentary rocks that formed, at least in part, during a period of time thought to be characterized by extreme swings in global climate. These episodes of severe climate change are dubbed the Snowball Earth epochs. Both the location of these microcontinents prior to their incorporation into Eurasia and the exact age of the glacial events preserved on the microcontinents are poorly known. This work focuses on obtaining paleomagnetic and geochronologic data from various microcontinents now located in Mongolia, Khazakhstan and Kyrgystan. The data collected in this study allow the investigators to better constrain the position of these microcontinents prior to their amalgamation into Eurasia. The data also supply researchers with important paleolatitudinal and geochronologic constraints on the glacial sediments preserved on the microcontinents. Since the Snowball Earth hypothesis posits near global synchroneity of glaciation across the planet, these data provide a critical test of the Snowball Earth hypothesis as well as a test of other competing explanations for this ancient ice age. Lastly, the data obtained in the study impose strong constraints on the general style of tectonic evolution for the Ural-Mongol fold belt that developed as a result of collisions between the microcontinental blocks and the closure of an ancient ocean.<br/><br/>Support for the project is provide by the Tectonics Program and by the Russia and Eurasia Group of the Office of International Science and Engineering.

Lack of infrastructure, intermittent connectivity, and frequent changes in topology due to mobility present significant challenges in the research of MANETs. While most prior efforts were primarily focused on the networking layer, there are compelling reasons supported by recent information theory and signal processing studies which indicate that an integrated approach seeking cross-layer diversity exploitation can lead to more fruitful results. This project follows that path.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop a framework of communication, networking, and signal processing techniques for MANETs by exploiting node cooperation at the physical, medium access, and networking layers. Three different but intertwined research directions are involved, Specifically, the first is to develop a distributive modulation theory over wireless relay channels, covering investigation of the characteristics of wireless relay channels, modulation and detection for coherent, differential and non-coherent communications for relay networks, power allocation and placement of relay nodes. The second direction is to develop bandwidth-efficient and delay-tolerant cooperative coding schemes to address several issues that are unique in coded cooperation, including bandwidth expansion caused by repetitive transmissions from relays, node asynchronism due to distributive locations of relays, and scalability (viz., the capability to degrade gracefully when some cooperating nodes that implement a distributive code fail because of fading). The third direction is to explore networking by parallel relays and develop networking protocols that take into account the realistic characteristics of radio signals and provide a flexible framework for diversity exploitation.

Federal and State Medicaid payments accounted for 48 percent of these expenditures, private payment accounted for 40 percent while Medicare accounted for 10 percent of the total.<br/>Television commercials tell us of the abuse that continues to occur in nursing homes. And the aging of the population is a reality that tells us many people will need the services of a nursing home at some point in their lives. Certificate-of-need (CON) policies were originally established as an attempt to contain escalating health care costs and to increase the accessibility of care to those most in need and to improve the quality of health services. In general, a CON program involves the regulation of the building, expansion, and modernization of health care facilities and capital equipment on the part of institutional health care providers. However, no regulation comes without a cost. With respect to the nursing home industry, it is not clear that over the last 26 years since the passage of The National Health Planning and Resources Development Act and its subsequent repeal that the continued use of CON policies by States has achieved its intended purposes of improved quality of nursing home care, increased accessibility to nursing home care for those most in need, or the containment of public expenditures on nursing home care. This project will create a database that will contain observations on all Medicaidcertified nursing homes from 1981-2003. The database will provide information on facility and resident characteristics, Medicaid reimbursement methods and rates, as well as the presence or absence of CON policies in the state in which the nursing home is<br/>located. Three econometric models will be estimated to test whether or not there is a difference in the quality of care, the access to care, and the cost of care between those States that have eliminated CON policies and those States that still retain CON policies. These models will allow the hypotheses that quality of care is better in States that have eliminated CON policies, that access to care for Medicaid patients is greater in States that have eliminated CON policies, and that Medicaid nursing home costs will be higher in<br/>those States that have eliminated CON policies. <br/>Broader Impacts Resulting from Proposed Activity<br/>This project will create a database that not only will answer the questions of interest specific to this proposal but will include information sufficient to answer many other questions concerning the nursing home industry such as the effect of staffing on nursing home quality, the effect of ownership on quality and cost, and the effect of reimbursement rates on quality. This database will provide the opportunity for collaboration with other researchers whose interests lie in the workings of the nursing home industry. With many States facing budget limitations and continued concerns over the rising costs of Medicaid payments, results may prove useful for policymakers concerning the efficient use of resources.

This work seeks to develop trackers that operate over two orders of magnitude more time (hours). Such long-term object tracking must be resilient to large changes in appearance of both the object and the surrounding environment. This requires raising the level of abstraction at which the tracker represents its target -- the goal must be tracking objects, not image templates or distributions of color. The intellectual merit of this effort is to achieve persistent object tracking through novel research that spans the areas of on-line feature selection, foreground/background segmentation, and object model learning and recognition. Flexible appearance-based object descriptors are developed that automatically adapt to changes in object and background appearance. Shape-constrained figure/ground segmentation is performed to avoid model drift during adaptation. Object models are learned on-the-fly during tracking and used to search for and recognize the same object again after occlusion or tracking failure. Development of this technology for persistent object tracking has broad impact in commercial applications such as traffic monitoring, motion capture and automated surveillance, as well as law enforcement and military applications in trailing suspects and combatants. This project promotes scientific repeatability, code-sharing and dissemination of results by maintaining a tracking evaluation web site that provides open source tracking code, benchmark datasets, and a mechanism for online evaluation.

The discovery that chips produced during common machining operations are composed entirely of ultra-fine grained structures, provides an opportunity for making these materials in large volumes. The approach will employ advanced powder processing routes to explore consolidation of particulate derived from the nanostructured machining chips. Electron microscopy will be used to characterize the nanocrystalline structures. A key element of the research is to quantify the effect of thermal processing on microstructure coarsening; this should facilitate optimization of microstructure and properties of the bulk materials. <br/><br/>Broad Impact and Intellectual Merit Nanostructured materials have been reported to exhibit significantly better properties than conventional materials, including higher hardness, strength and ductility. The high cost of creating these materials, however, has restricted their broad application. A fundamental understanding of consolidation and densification processes will be necessary before widespread use of any particulate nanostructured materials in the discrete products sector can be expected. An important secondary benefit, with broad societal impact, will be providing higher value utilization for machining chips produced in manufacturing operations. Complementing the research is an innovative education program, which builds on a strong interaction with an institution having a high enrollment of African-American students and includes summer undergraduate research internships.

Feng, Univ California/ Ivine)<br/>0510655 (Chin-An Tang, Wayne Statye Univ)<br/><br/>In the long-term health monitoring of bridge structures, system identification that is essential for assessing the global condition of the bridge is often based on measured vibration response or the system output. Two major obstacles remain in the path to realization of an integrated health monitoring system. First, knowledge of the input (i.e., traffic excitation) is unknown or limited, rendering an accurate assessment of the state of the bridge structures difficult. Second, efficient procedure must be developed for processing and interpreting the vast amount of data from sensors. This research focuses on developing a novel, video-assisted approach for enhancing bridge health monitoring. Important traffic information characterizing the input excitation, such as the vehicle arrival times, speeds and types, is proposed to be extracted from digital video. Since camera systems are readily available in many existing bridges (as surveillance cameras), this proposal represents a low-cost approach to significantly enhance our understanding of the traffic input. Novel algorithms for processing and analyzing synchronized traffic information and bridge vibration data will perform integrated system identification and improve the health monitoring <br/>This is a joint research between two universities encompassing the expertise necessary for the successful completion of this project. Professor Tan and Professor Yin from WSU will be in charge of (1) development and verification of the traffic excitation model and the bridge damage diagnosis on a statistical basis, (2) vehicle classification from the video pattern recognition and (3) web-based data sharing and presentation of the monitoring project for educational purpose. Professor Feng at UCI will take the lead in (1) installation of weather-proof video cameras and field data collection at a fully instrumented bridge, (2) development of real-time algorithms on a chip allowing transmission of processed traffic data to significantly reduce the amount of data transmission and (3) development of system identification algorithms based on system output and partial input information obtained from the video.

The main problems are (1) where to look for life, (2) what to look for, and (3) how to know when you find it. The intellectual merit of this project consists of the effort to investigate these problems. Investigating these questions, however, involves a host of scientific disciplines, many of which do not normally interact with one another. To achieve this, this continuing IGERT-funded graduate training program will have: (1) a strong engineering and instrumentation component, (2) specific training in teamwork and teaching, (3) innovative training in scientific writing, especially for communicating across disciplines and to the general public, (4) improved collaboration with other developing astrobiology programs, both domestic and foreign, and (5) more effective recruiting, mentoring and retention of members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering. This second phase of IGERT support will allow further progress in institutionalizing successful innovative practices in interdisciplinary education. The broader impacts of the project are releated both to basic and applied scientific questions and goals. The questions posed by astrobiology are of great general interest and are among the most fundamental for both scientists and the public because knowing whether life on Earth is unique affects our approach to the stewardship of our own planet and the exploration of our cosmic environment. Astrobiology is also providing the guiding principles behind NASA's redirection of planetary exploration and hence the outcome of this substantial research investment is dependent on training scientists capable of getting the scientific fundamentals right. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.

Remanufacturing extends the scope of traditional manufacturing and logistics activities to include forward and reverse flows as well as the corresponding forward and reverse channel activities. As a result, the traditional unidirectional supply chains need to be transformed into closed-loop supply chains. To ensure a successful transformation, this research will develop analytical models and efficient computational procedures for the optimization of network design and inventory/production planning decisions arising in the context of closed-loop supply chain systems. The results will provide analytical and computational tools for a comparison of cost and other logistical performance implications of i) alternative network design strategies, and ii) inventory/production planning policies under different seeding and product collection practices.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will broaden the theory of logistics as applied to closed-loop supply chain problems. The results are also expected to elicit insights into the efficient design and operation of closed-loop supply chains, and, hence, facilitate successful and widespread implementation of remanufacturing practices in industry. Moreover, as the research agenda has been developed in collaboration with industry, the project will foster the development of stronger interactions between the industry and academic partners.

Delphi is a leading manufacturer of mobile electronics, transportation components and systems technology. In this project, UNM and Delphi will team together to address a problem which pervades all applications of heterogeneous catalysts, namely the loss of active metal surface area during high temperature operation of heterogeneous catalysts. Catalyst sintering represents one of the most important factors limiting the long-term durability of catalysts. While nano-sized metal particles represent the mainstay of heterogeneous catalysis, coarsening of nanoparticles can occur at rather modest temperatures, causing irreversible changes in activity and selectivity. Industrial catalytic processes must therefore operate at temperatures where the rate of metal surface area loss due to sintering can be kept within manageable proportions. Despite its obvious technological importance, fundamental understanding of sintering is still lacking and predictive models are not available. The work will address the key variables that affect sintering rates: pore structure, gas atmosphere, metal-oxide interface, and support morphology.<br/><br/> The research will be carried out at UNM while Delphi will contribute by providing personnel time, materials such as catalyst supports and finished catalysts and also providing access to its testing facilities. Experiments will be conducted with model catalysts that include (a) single crystal oxide surfaces or (b) surfactant templated oxide powders. A unique feature of the proposed research program is that industrial catalyst structures will be used as a test bed to explore the broad applicability of fundamental concepts being studied on model catalysts. The results of this research will be published in the archival literature and presented at national and international conferences in this field. The knowledge gained from fundamental studies of model catalysts will be applied to industrially relevant catalysts whose performance can be tested under realistic conditions. A specific objective of the proposed research program is the development of novel approaches for the study of heterogeneous catalysts. In addition, we will develop methods to control the nano-scale surface topology of catalyst supports, a factor that has heretofore been ignored in heterogeneous catalysis. The major contribution of this research program will be systematic studies of sintering phenomena under industrially relevant conditions, development of innovative approaches for the study of industrial heterogeneous catalysts and the development of synthetic approaches to engineer heterogeneous catalysts at the nano-scale.

The research will extend the PI's investigations of the fundamental aspects of alkene photoisomerization in confined media. The focus of the project is the Hula-Twist (HT) mechanism for photochemical conversion of cis to trans alkenes, which was discovered by the PI and is now thought to be important in many photobiological processes. A series of experiments designed to explore the effect of substitution and spin multiplicity on the H-T photoisomerization will be undertaken. The regeoselectivity and the isotope effects on this reaction will also be examined. In a series of experiments that are relevant to photobiology and photoprocesses in material science, the role of HT isomerizations in retinals, cyanine dyes, and pyrrole based alkenes will be investigated. <br/><br/>These investigations of alkene photoisomerization, which will provide fundamental new information on photochemical reactivity, will have significant impact on areas ranging from the chemistry of vision to materials science. The project provides an excellent way of introducing undergraduate students to a sophisticated research program.

This research project studies how individual and societal judgment and decision behavior is influenced by feelings and emotion in the aftermath of a major natural disaster. On December 27, 2004 a Tsunami struck southern Asia and East Africa resulting in over 150,000 lives lost. Southern Asia is a popular tourist resort, especially for Scandinavian travelers. One Scandinavian country, Sweden (pop. 9 million), had an unusually large number of tourists visiting the area at the time of the disaster. As a result, more than twelve hundred Swedes were killed or are missing. The Tsunami disaster is therefore the biggest national tragedy in Sweden in the last hundred years. A consequence of this tragedy, and the media attention it received and still receives, is that many Swedes feel deeply involved and saddened (e.g., a national mood). We propose that change in a nation's mood can have a profound impact on people's judgment and decision behavior. The aim of this project is to test research hypotheses about how affect experienced by a whole nation can influence risk perceptions, evaluative judgments, judgments about the future, and the decision strategies people use to mitigate their negative feelings. The national mood experienced in the aftermath of the Tsunami provides a unique possibility to test the research hypotheses in a whole population. Data will be collected in surveys, experiments, and through analyses of secondary objective data (consumption before and after the Tsunami disaster). The proposed studies will help to advance our basic understanding of how affect and feelings influence judgment and decision making, as well as to indicate how feelings tied to big events like natural disasters impact subsequent risk and decision behavior.

The growth of<br/>search as an industry is testament to this problem, but existing tools<br/>are incomplete solutions. They index content, but not context. They<br/>capture only static, syntactic relationships, not dynamic, semantic<br/>ones. Perhaps most importantly, they have access only to information<br/>stored either on a user's local machine or publicly-accessible<br/>distributed stores---other sources are neither indexed nor searchable.<br/>Information Pedigree solves this problem by capturing context and<br/>semantic relationships between information items, collecting disparate<br/>relationship meta-data to support searches, and providing for<br/>availability of relevant items created on machines controlled by<br/>individual users. Information Pedigree achieves this goal by<br/>instrumenting the flow of information between a user's applications<br/>and services, as well as the flow of information between different<br/>users. By observing these transactions, we form a contextual and<br/>semantic index over data that is used, simplifying its retrieval for<br/>later use.<br/><br/>Information Pedigree will make it easier for people to find and share<br/>data, without placing additional burdens on them or their IT support<br/>staff. This greatly reduces time wasted in managing information,<br/>allowing information workers to be more productive. The results from<br/>this project will be widely disseminated in the research literature,<br/>and a prototype of the system will be made available to other<br/>researchers as well as users. This project will train several<br/>graduate students, and influence the curricula of several graduate and<br/>undergraduate courses.

The approach will be to perform laser micro melting tests on workpieces with given surface micro patterns to investigate the effect of laser wavelength, pulse duration, intensity, scanning speed (overlap), repetition, scanning pattern, and spot size on temperature distribution and surface topography change. This will allow micro melting and kinetic models to be developed that will guide process optimization and predict laser polished surface topography. Means for surface condition representation, surface condition prediction, and laser motion control with respect to the micro/meso part will be developed and combined to create an effective laser micro polishing process.<br/><br/>Surface conditions (including roughness and waviness) of parts fabricated by emerging micro/meso manufacturing processes generally are far worse than those of larger parts fabricated by conventional manufacturing processes. If successful, the benefit of this research will be significant improvement in these surface conditions. This will result in improved performance of micro/meso parts such as dies/molds that, for example, can be used in the making of very small medical equipment components. Also, the highly repetitive surface processing motion that will be studied may improve and facilitate automation of other manufacturing processes. To improve public knowledge of micro/meso manufacturing and surface engineering technologies, this work will be introduced in an appropriate manner to engineering students and, through outreach activities, to students and teachers in elementary and secondary schools.

This project will support speakers for (1) a Systems Biology Workshop, and (2) an undergraduate research speaker session.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The broad mission of the Protein Society is to further research and development in protein science. Within this intellectual framework, the Education Committee aims to facilitate discussions about education at the undergraduate and graduate levels in protein science. Towards these goals, two events will be sponsored. The first, a workshop on teaching and systems biology will offer a hands-on tutorial with the tools being used by researchers in systems biology. Systems biology is a thematic element at this year's symposium and is an under-appreciated field in the education community. Four experts in this field will present their work and lead a discussion. The second event will sponsor research presentations from faculty and students coming from predominantly undergraduate institutions to speak about their work. Requests for abstracts will be sent out to targeted faculty and students participating in RUI-level research for competitive renewal. The goal of this program is to highlight the quality of the research opportunities that are available to undergraduate students at the national level in protein science. Four faculty and eight students will be chosen to present their work at this research session.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: By programming such events at this international meeting, it is expected that recruitment will be fostered of well-qualified undergraduates for careers in graduate science and visibility will be provided to the state of undergraduate education and research around the nation. The meeting will highlight developing scientists from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Particular efforts will be made to afford gender balance as well. These sessions will enrich the Protein Society membership. Senior scientists of the Society will be educated about the quality research that is carried out by undergraduates at PUI's and have an opportunity to recruit for their graduate programs. Undergraduate students will have a chance to shine and make critical contacts for graduate school and beyond. While attending symposia, undergraduate students will be exposed to speaker and poster presentations from the diverse fields of protein science often not possible to integrate into the classroom. Faculty at undergraduate institutions will have a chance to promote their work and their students. The opportunity to present undergraduate research at the meeting will attract new membership to the Society and new participation. The development of education outreach at this international meeting is coming at a critical juncture since science and math training has been targeted as a crucial at-risk discipline in the nation. Intervention at the undergraduate level, as provided by these workshops, will help to meet a critical growing need for well-educated scientists.

A certain component of the insect's brain, the mushroom body, is known to be involved in learning and memory and to control complex behavior. The mushroom body is particularly large and elaborate in bees. The aim of the project is to determine how the mushroom body processes sensory input such as color, movement, odor, etc. This information is distributed to different layers of the mushroom body. Does each layer represent a particular aspect of the world the bee perceives? Do nerve cells combine specific stimulus combinations relevant for learning or navigation? Can electrical brain stimulation change how the nerve cells process sensory information? The electrical signals and responses of individual nerve cells will be recorded while the bee watches relevant stimuli on a video screen. Afterwards, the nerve cells will be injected with a tracer and the cell's structure and branching pattern in the brain will be three-dimensionally reconstructed and compared to its response properties. This study will help to understand general mechanisms of sensory processing by nerve cells that are involved in learning, memory and cognition. The project makes use of a relatively simple nervous system that is much easier to approach experimentally than vertebrate animals, yet through evolutionary relationship individual nerve cells in the bee brain perform the same operations as nerve cells in the human brain. The project will help minority undergaduate students and students from community colleges to get involved in scientific research and will train graduate students in techniques and approaches relevant in biology and computer science (artificial intelligence).

The initial Eocene thermal maximum (IETM, ca. 55 Ma) was a short-lived (~100 - 200 kyr) global warming event driven by a sudden increase in greenhouse gases similar in temporal scale to present-day anthropogenic influxes. This influx was postulated to have been due to a massive release of methane from marine gas hydrates. The subsequent increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases [carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)] had a worldwide impact on the earth's surficial processes and functional partitioning of biogeochemical cycles. Marine records of the IETM clearly document the isotopic and mineralogic shifts triggered by this perturbation, while the response on subaerially exposed landmasses is not as well understood. Of particular interest is the transient character of this climatic overshoot, which reflects the presence of negative feedbacks (accelerated weathering reactions) that stabilized climate by reducing atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases. We propose to study the influence of this climatic warming on sedimentation patterns and weathering rates within the remarkably fine-textured sedimentary members of the Williston Basin (WB) in western North Dakota. These units contain well preserved, multi-proxy information (i.e., palynomorph/ macrofloral fossils, authigenic minerals and paleopedogenic features, well-preserved organic materials) that lends itself well to temporal and spatial cross-correlation. This study poses the hypothesis that the fine resolution stratigraphic package in the WB records a sympathetic terrestrial signal/response to the release of isotopically-light marine methane hydrate and subsequent global warming. To investigate this hypothesis, we will use 1) whole sediment composition, 2) semi-quantitative clay mineralogy, and 3) stable isotope geochemistry to ascertain alterations and rates in sedimentary process and sub-aerial weathering intensity in response to the warmer global climate hypothesized to have prevailed during the IETM. Our preliminary investigations provide evidence indicating that a record of the IETM is preserved within the WB and that there is a definitive shift in sediment geochemistry across this boundary. This integrated record can be tied to well-documented IETM records in neighboring contemporaneous interior basins (e.g., Bighorn Basin of Wyoming) and will augment our understanding of mid-latitude sub-continental response to rapid climate change.<br/>Broader Impacts: It is important to compare the reality of a well-preserved multi-proxy<br/>stratigraphic record to thermodynamic models of biogeochemical fluxes and estimated physical reconstructions from an interdisciplinary aspect. The linkage of our records to those preserved in the Big Horn Basin will build a stronger understanding of sub-continental land mass responses to rapid global warming. The principle investigators will utilize the information to strengthen fledgling research programs in paleoenvironmental reconstruction and paleopedology. This study will be a mechanism for graduate/ undergraduate students to develop research projects. Once investigative work has yielded a comprehensive data set, a colloquium field trip class will be conducted, with participants conducting weekly discussions in preparation for a two-week field excursion through the Western Interior Basin (WIB) province (Williston, Powder River, Bighorn, Wasatch, and Green River Basins). This will provide students an opportunity to view and synthesize sub-continental scale information. Manuscripts from this project will be published in recognized interdisciplinary earth science journals and a linked website devoted to the WIB with specific focus on the work encompassed by this study will be constructed for access by the academic community. Finally, results of this proposed research will be incorporated into a public outreach program at the University of Wisconsin Geology Museum.

A third <br/>project, the Alliance Curriculum Project, provides for a careful analysis of <br/>the similarities and differences of undergraduate mathematics courses taught <br/>at participating institutions with an eye toward building seamless <br/>transitions between undergraduate mathematics programs at Alliance HBCUs and <br/>doctoral programs at majority institutions. A fourth project, the Alliance <br/>High School Math Circle, involves Alliance Scholars in outreach activities <br/>in the communities in which their schools are located.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) enroll approximately <br/>20% of all African Americans who attend four year undergraduate <br/>institutions; they account for approximately 30% of all African Americans <br/>who graduate from these institutions. Yet, with the exception of three or <br/>four elite HBCUs with an established tradition of excellence, it is <br/>extremely rare for graduates of HBCUs to enroll in doctoral programs in the <br/>mathematical sciences or, indeed, in any doctoral program which leads to a <br/>position in the professoriate. The reason for this is not hard to <br/>ascertain: in fact, with few exceptions, African Americans were simply not <br/>welcome among the ranks of the professoriate until quite recently. As a <br/>result, HBCUs have tended to focus on producing professionals - doctors, <br/>lawyers, teachers and religious leaders who have historically provided <br/>critical infrastructure to a community at risk due to segregation and overt <br/>discrimination. Less than 2% of all Ph.D. in mathematics awarded at US <br/>universities each year are awarded to African Americans, a percentage that <br/>has remained more or less stable over the last twenty five years. It is the <br/>goal of this project to ease the transition to graduate programs in <br/>mathematics for students attending HBCUs with an eye toward improving these <br/>numbers.
0505663	Topological excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates: Existence, stability, dynamics, and interactions	DMS	APPLIED MATHEMATICS	07/15/2005	07/06/2005	Ricardo Carretero	CA	San Diego State University Foundation	Standard Grant	Henry A. Warchall	06/30/2008	$91,861.00	Panayotis Kevrekidis	rcarretero@mail.sdsu.edu	5250 Campanile Drive	San Diego	CA	921822190	6195945731	MPS	1266	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Nonlinear media host a wide variety of localized coherent structures<br/>(solitons, wavetrains, vortices, spirals, etc.) with complex intrinsic<br/>properties and interactions that, in turn, give rise to emergent patterns<br/>with nontrivial dynamics. The theme of the proposed research is a detailed<br/>examination of vortices generated in dispersive nonlinear media.<br/>The main focus is to extend and deepen the understanding of vortex<br/>structures, their existence and dynamical stability as well as their<br/>interactions and mesoscopic lattices in nonlinear media such as<br/>Bose-Einstein condensates and related fields (such as nonlinear optics).<br/>We propose to follow a step-by-step methodology in studying the<br/>generation, stability and dynamics of vortices in a progression of<br/>scenaria of increasing complexity, extending from single vortices, <br/>to few vortices, to vortex lattices. Specifically, we plan to study:<br/>(1) Vortex generation through dynamical instabilities and external<br/>manipulations such as phase imprinting and via instabilities driven by<br/>rapidly moving impurities (focused laser beams).<br/>(2) Dynamics and stability of single vortices (a.k.a. atoms) in the<br/>presence of external traps and manipulation of vortices by translating the<br/>external traps or by using localized optical tweezers.<br/>(3) Interactions between vortices and formation, stability and dynamics<br/>of vortex dipoles (a.k.a. molecules/dipoles).<br/>(4) Finally, we intend to investigate, by cross-fertilizing ideas from<br/>material science, large arrays of vortices, their crystallization and<br/>structural phase transitions into regular vortex lattices (a.k.a. crystals).<br/><br/>In the 1920's Bose and Einstein predicted that a gas at low density and<br/>ultra-cold temperatures undergoes a transition towards what is nowadays<br/>called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The most important characteristic<br/>of a BEC is that all atoms occupy the same quantum state creating a macroscopic<br/>lump of coherent matter. BECs are to matter what laser is to light. BECs allow<br/>for direct manipulation and observation of quantum effects at the macroscopic<br/>level, providing ultimate control over matter. Since their recent<br/>experimental realization (for which the 2001 Physics Nobel prize was<br/>granted), BECs have been at the focus of an intensive and ever growing<br/>experimental and theoretical effort. Vortices are fundamental coherent,<br/>topologically charged, nonlinear excitations that emerge in BECs; but<br/>which also play a profound role in exciting and important fields such as<br/>superconductivity and superfluidity (which were the theme of the 2003<br/>Physics Nobel prize). Interestingly enough, they also arise in our daily<br/>life in the form of hydrodynamic vortices in water or in air. There are<br/>strong parallels (as well as differences) between such fluid vortices and<br/>these ultra-cold, superfluid vortices that we plan to examine and<br/>delineate. The outcome of this research will shed light into the pattern<br/>formation and interaction of such vortex structures in Bose-Einstein<br/>condensates. Since the underlying equation that describes the BECs also<br/>describes the behavior of coherent light embedded in a nonlinear<br/>material, the research hereby proposed will also be applicable to<br/>problems of optical waveguides and fiber bundles, photonic crystals, and<br/>light storage in optical traps, all of which are active research areas at<br/>the forefront of optical technologies. The proposed research has<br/>potential applications to quantum-optical storage<br/>and quantum computing for the next generation of computers.<br/>The research effort is part of an ongoing collaboration between<br/>the PI and Co-PI and involves more than a dozen coworkers that blend in<br/>expertise in fields as diverse as dynamical systems, nonlinear optics,<br/>condensed matter, materials science and scientific computing. Specially<br/>attractive is the prospect that our results will be partially driven and<br/>could be relevant to current experimental research conducted in BEC<br/>experiments. This highly inter-disciplinary research program will also<br/>involve a major educational component through the direct involvement of<br/>graduate research assistants and postdoctoral fellows.

Although many research works focus on the fabrication of limited number of nano structures and devices, for true adaptation of the techniques in the engineering field, a reliable replication process must be sought after. Using the proposed equipment, multidisciplinary themes in the areas of MEMS fabrication, nanooptics, bio-inspired self-assembly and nano-microsensor will be pursued. <br/><br/>Education and training is an essential part of the proposal. Two graduate courses, one undergrad course and one community college course will be leveraged by this system. On an average, twenty graduate students and forty undergraduate students will have hands-on experience in nanofabrication using this equipment every year. Educational outreach for K-12 students and teachers has been planned. Workshops for external users will be held regularly to train workforces in the Central Florida area. An online reservation system and user group community will be set up to overcome geographical limitations and to facilitate the external user's access.
0501778	Functional Genomic Analysis of Fruit Flavor and Nutrition Pathways	IOS	PLANT GENOME RESEARCH PROJECT	09/01/2005	08/01/2006	Harry Klee	FL	University of Florida	Standard Grant	Diane Jofuku Okamuro	08/31/2010	$2,072,349.00	James Giovannoni, Denise Tieman, Zhangjun Fei	hjklee@ifas.ufl.edu	1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA	GAINESVILLE	FL	326112002	3523923516	BIO	1329	9109, BIOT	$0.00	Flavor and nutritional quality are highly complex traits that make them difficult targets for traditional approaches for crop improvement. Tomato is the established model for fruit development, genetics and biochemistry and has recently been targeted for genome sequencing by an international consortium of ten nations. This project targets the improvement of flavor and nutrition, identifying genes involved in synthesis of essential metabolites. The diverse and well-characterized tomato germplasm will be evaluated with high throughput metabolite screens to identify lines altered in flavor and nutrient composition. An integrated genetic, genomic and bioinformatic approach will be employed for the purpose of isolating the genes responsible for the genetic variation. In the first phase of the program, multiple genetic loci that influence fruit composition were identified and a public database was established to disseminate the collected information (http://tomet.bti.cornell.edu/). These resources will be expanded in order to identify genes controlling synthesis of ~30 metabolites with major functions in flavor and nutrient quality. At completion, the public will have access to data for over 200 fruit metabolites and expression data for approximately 10,000 genes assayed across 75 tomato lines. This research has broad implications for flavor and nutrition in the human diet. Identification of genes controlling flavor and nutrient quality will positively impact traditional breeding and biotechnology programs with direct end user impact. The program will provide training for students and postdoctoral associates in a broad range of genetic, genomic, bioinformatic and biochemical techniques. There is a strong emphasis on training opportunities for collaborators at predominantly minority institutions. While this program addresses important attributes of a major agricultural crop, the findings will be directly applicable to many other important crops grown in the US and worldwide.<br/><br/>
0524990	DDI--Molecular systematics of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus: Primates, Cercopithecidae)	BCS	Biological Anthropology	08/01/2005	10/02/2006	Eric Delson	NY	CUNY Graduate School University Center	Standard Grant	Richard Kay	12/31/2006	$8,500.00	John Oates, Todd Disotell	eric.delson@lehman.cuny.edu	365 Fifth Avenue	New York	NY	100164309	2128177523	SBE	1392	9179, SMET	$0.00	Red colobus monkeys (subfamily Colobinae, genus Procolobus, subgenus Piliocolobus) are distributed across equatorial Africa in over 14 different forms and display a complex pattern of variation. They currently rank among the most endangered primates in Africa, and their classification remains one of the longest-standing problems in African primate taxonomy. Using molecular techniques, this research will build a phylogeny and classification for red colobus monkeys, representing the most comprehensive molecular study of African leaf monkeys to date. Specifically, this research has the following objectives; 1) establish relationships among red colobus populations, 2) develop a taxonomy that accurately reflects the diversity within the group, 3) provide distributional information on red colobus populations, and 4) further our knowledge concerning colobine evolutionary history. Fecal, tissue from museum collections, and hair samples from numerous red colobus populations have been collected and will be subjected to DNA extraction and sequencing; GPS data collected in the field will be used to map geographical distributions; and molecular phylogenetic methods will be employed to estimate nuclear and mitochondrial DNA gene trees, which will be used to address questions concerning colobine systematics and the timing of vicariance events within the group. The results will lead to a better understanding of the behavioral ecology, morphology, and evolutionary radiation of the leaf monkeys, and allow the testing of hypotheses concerning African primate biogeography. <br/>Among the most important broader impacts of this project are the conservation implications. When there is no universal agreement on species-level classification, identification of endangered species becomes problematic, making the designation of conservation priorities difficult. Because one of the goals of conservation is to preserve genetic diversity, and taxonomy is meant to reflect phylogenetic relationships and genetic distinctiveness, well-resolved phylogenies are essential for effective conservation. Since red colobus relationships are currently poorly resolved, this study has implications for effective species-level conservation, biodiversity analysis, and designation of conservation priorities. Also, while in the field collecting samples, the student Co-PI collected distributional information for endangered red colobus populations, and hired and trained local field assistants. This Co-PI will also be instrumental in the tutelage of undergraduates in a molecular anthropology laboratory. The results of this research will be published in scholarly journals and presented at academic conferences, and sequences will be submitted to the publicly accessible GenBank database hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Furthermore, this research will foster the professional development of a doctoral student.

Yellen	08/31/2006	$12,000.00		fmarshal@artsci.wustl.edu	CAMPUS BOX 1054	Saint Louis	MO	631304862	3147474134	SBE	1391	9179, SMET	$0.00	Under the direction of Dr. Fiona Marshall, Mr. Lior Weissbrod will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will study small rodent faunas in contemporary Maasai pastoralist villages to determine the relationship between faunal composition and the degree of sedentism. The Maasai are a pastoral people dependent on herds of cattle, sheep and goats for food. Based on the degree of seasonal change in the immediate environment, some groups can maintain year round residence in a single location while others must move seasonally. Through comparison of the rodent populations both across villages and between villages and the surrounding area Mr. Weissbrod will determine the relationship between mobility and species specific rodent population structure. The goal is to develop an archaeologically applicable tool which will permit archaeologists to reconstruct degree of prehistoric human mobility based on excavated rodent remains. Since bias can result through differential preservation and burial, and excavated remains may only indirect reflect the prior living population, Mr. Weissbrod will also conduct excavations in Maasai villages to determine the relationship between observed living and buried skeletal populations. He will then test his methods on collections from an excavated archaeological site.<br/><br/>Mobile pastoralists were the earliest food producers in Africa. There was considerable variation in subsistence and in the organization of relations within and among prehistoric pastoral groups. An important underlying goal of the current research is to understand how varying social, economic and political factors contributed to these patterns and to the development and spread of food production in Africa. Mobility is an essential strategy used by pastoralists to cope with unpredictable resources in arid lands and with changing economic and political circumstances. Reconstructing the dimensions of mobility of prehistoric pastoral groups, including length of occupation and group size is central to understanding the nature of variability in social, economic and political organization and Mr. Weissbrod's research will provide a tool to help in this process. This award will also further the academic and intellectual development of a promising young scientist.

In August of 1871, 31 Yankee whaling ships were crushed by the ice and sunk, or burned near Point Belcher, Alaska. This event had enormous impact on the Native population and on the whaling community. Little is actually known about the location and condition of these significant wrecks. An attempt to locate wrecks in the 1990s had technical difficulties, but during testing of an underwater camera, a single wreck was located, demonstrating that some wrecks do remain on the ocean bottom. The customary approach to Arctic underwater exploration relies on a large and expensive support vessel, but the Point Belcher location is a good candidate for exploring with different, less costly methods. Due to the wrecks' expected close proximity to shore it is reasonable to expect that an accurate site survey can be accomplished with a small, land-based team using an inflatable vessel. The investigators have developed and successfully used these techniques for many years on Lake Superior and it is now reasonable to attempt to demonstrate their value on this type of arctic project.<br/><br/>This project will be a research contribution by locating and documenting shipwrecks from the 1871 Yankee whaling ship disaster, while supplying a proof of concept for shore-based underwater exploration techniques in the Arctic. Results will allow for future access to important data sources (the wrecks) by investigators who are researching cultural history, materials longevity in Arctic waters, and marine colonization of artificial reefs. At no time during the project will any site disturbance or artifact retrieval take place. The project will have broader societal impacts through its direct collaborations with Native institutions (UIC Science Center and Inupiat Heritage Center), and with community organizations (North Slope Borough School District, Barrow Arctic Science Consortium), and through community presentations for the general public. The team will preliminarily assess the conditions of the wrecks and determine if further evaluation and documentation is warranted. <br/>

The research focuses on four topics: the dynamical mechanisms by which the mountain torque alters the amplitude and phase of the equatorial atmospheric angular momentum vector, a comparison of the relative importance of the processes driving the intra-seasonal fluctuations, the relationship between equatorial atmospheric angular momentum dynamics and the background flow, and how atmospheric processes drive polar motion, i.e. fluctuations in both the pole position relative to the earth's crust and in the equatorial components of the angular momentum of the solid earth. Reanalysis and outgoing longwave radiation datasets as well as a timeseries of pole position will be used.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research will be of interest to solid-earth geophysical scientists and satellite dynamics scientists.

This project investigates climatic effects of vegetation from the standpoint that vegetation adapts optimally to its environment in terms of its form and functioning, thereby maximizing its productivity. Optimized vegetation properties and climatic impacts are investigated through sensitivity simulations and optimizations of coupled dynamic global vegetation - climate system model of intermediate complexity.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The PI will (1) Quantify large-scale optima of the coupled climate-vegetation system with respect to important climate-related vegetation properties, such as stomatal conductance, rooting zone depth, and aerodynamic canopy roughness, (2) Quantify the associated climatic impacts, and (3) Validate vegetation properties derived by optimization by comparing these to observations across different vegetation types. Completion of this work will offer new insights into:<br/><br/>1. Optimization approaches to improve vegetation parameterizations in climate system models <br/>2. Comprehensive treatment of the role of vegetation in the global climate system and its feedbacks to global climatic change.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The research will provide a better understanding of the role of vegetation adaptations in studies of present global climatic change.

The physical processes that we can improve by pursuing such a study include 1) molecular focusing for purposes of detection and reaction and 2) separation methods for molecular sorting. The essential idea of the proposal is that a combination of hydrodynamic and electromagnetic forces, designed using dynamical systems theory, can enable trapping and separation methods for submicron scale bioparticles. We will focus our study on applications in dielectrophoretic biomolecule manipulation where forces on particles are generated by spatially nonhomogeneous alternating current electric fields and induced fluid flows. However, the dynamical systems aspects of the theory are projected to have broader impact to enabling technologies for manipulation of particles with electromagnetic fields and fluid flows.<br/><br/>In particular, major medical technology breakthroughs and advances in security against bioterror will be enabled by the use of electromagnetic fields and fluid flows for manipulation and detection of materials and processes at the nanometer scale. However, the accuracy, speed and sensitivity of the currently available devices is not at the level that allows for such breakthroughs. The lack of quality is in part due to the lack of understanding of nonlinear dynamics of processes and motions at micro- and nanoscale. In our work we will provide such an understanding that will ultimately enable development of fast, miniaturized devices for detection of biotoxins. Our results will also impact developments in the area of point-of-care diagnostics, where medical doctors will be able to perform a simple check based on the cheek swab that can tell them whether to administer an antibiotic (and which one, at that) or not in the matter of minutes. The broader impact of the proposed project includes interdisciplinary education of the members of the group. We are planning several educational activities where some of the biotechnology issues that we study will be popularized for K-8 and high-school level students in the region.

Storrs	CT	062691133	8604863622	GEO	5740	OTHR, 0000	$0.00	Several modeling studies indicate that terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere interactions may give rise to the existence of multiple equilibria in the Earth's climate system. However, diagnosing whether multiple equilibrium states exist in global climate system models and why they exist where they do is extremely challenging; the impact of multiple equilibria on the long-term variability and changes of regional-global climates is not well understood. The research objectives of this project are to two-fold: first, to understand the mechanisms responsible for the existence of multiple biosphere-atmosphere equilibria in certain climate models and over certain regions; second, to understand the natural variability of regional climate systems that do possess multiple equilibrium states.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit. Based on a conceptual dynamical model for vegetation-precipitation interactions, the PI develops four hypotheses. These hypotheses will be evaluated using a global circulation model developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and models that will be derived from it by changing the quantification of certain properties or changing the parameterization of certain processes within the model. Completion of this work will offer new insights into:<br/><br/>1. The existence of multiple equilibrium states in the global biosphere-atmosphere system as simulated by global general circulation models, and <br/>2. An improved understanding of climate variability, climate changes, and their model dependence.<br/><br/>Broader impacts. The research will provide a better understanding about how a system with multiple equilibria behaves, which may increase the ability of affected populations to adapt to and mitigate the impact of potential climate transitions between different equilibria. This project provides learning experiences and training for undergraduate and graduate-level students in the field of climate system modeling and climate-vegetation interactions.

Photonics Leaders seeks to enhance access to science and science careers for all students, especially minority students, by giving the opportunities to participate in real scientific investigations making use of technological tools. The project has chosen this theme because it allows students to investigate the technology that they encounter day to day. They will engage in collaborative, hands-on activities that explore photonics technology and the science framework that supports that technology. The project will have links to the North Carolina standard course of study in chemistry, environmental/earth science, and physics. They will investigate how the physics of light and the technology of solid-state electronics meet in devices such as how optical communications are used in TV remote controls or CD players.

This research involves the design, implementation, and evaluation of new standards-compliant data compression methods that will allow ASL video, and other structured video, to be transmitted over low bandwidth cell phone channels. To be more specific, the goal of this research is to develop a framework in which to implement low-complexity H.264 encoding to provide maximum quality compressed structured video. Because the developed algorithms will be H.264 standard-compliant, an off-the-shelf H.264 decoder can be used.<br/><br/>The research applies to any class of videos where there is some inherent structure that can be exploited. The five areas of research are: (1) Design of an appropriate objective distortion metric for ASL; (2) Design of algorithms to preprocess video for display on small devices; (3) Development of methods to exploit structure in video for efficient coding; (4) Implementation of a rate-distortion-complexity optimization of H.264 using the new metric; and (5) Applications of the framework to other structured video such as surveillance video. Studies with ASL users are used to develop the objective intelligibility metric and to evaluate the new compression techniques.

In particular, so-called directed self-assembly methods have been demonstrated recently based on the use of pre-patterned substrates or vertical alignment in growth of multilayers, allowing a high degree of control over size distributions and growth of complex patterned arrays. While tremendous progress has been made for semiconductor systems, self- assembly of metallic nanostructures has not been advanced to the same degree. Such developments offer the potential to revolutionize the development of future media for ultra-high-density magnetic recording. The primary goal of the project is to advance the state of the art in multiscale computational materials science through development of a suite of tools for predictive modeling of directed self- assembly. These tools will be utilized to build fundamental understanding of important microscopic and continuum-level phenomena governing nanoscale self-assembly. Although the computational tools to be developed are general and will have application beyond the systems studied, the feasibility of our approach in applications to specific systems will be demonstrated for the well-studied magnetic material systems Fe/Mo and Fe/W. We propose an integrated approach by joining forces of computational experts from the European Community and the United States, spanning the atomistic to the continuum scales. The work will involve ab initio calculations of surface energies, surface stress, and surface diffusion coefficients, as well as statistical mechanics, mesoscopic and continuum calculations of the evolution of nanostructural morphology and composition of dots during both deposition and annealing, and the resulting self-assembly. By parameter passing, each effort will feed into the other, as the information at the smaller scale will be employed in the larger scale calculations, enabling us to bridge a wide range of length and time scales. Using this approach, we can address questions such as how the interplay between kinetic and thermodynamic effects lead to nanostructural formation and what controls the spatial and size distributions of the dots. Answers to these questions are not only of fundamental interest but also allow us to provide insights into processes that produce large-scale self-organized arrays of magnetic dots. To fulfill these specific tasks, we combine modern computational tools, like phase-field models, homogenization techniques and asymptotic expansions with state- of-the-art computational methods, such as multigrid solvers, adaptive and composite finite elements and parallel kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, in collaboration with an experimental partner in EU, the models will be subjected to sharp and intensive tests and validation on the model systems.<br/>Broader Impacts: The major impacts on the community at large are two-fold: (1) New intensive summer courses on crystal and epitaxial growth for gifted high school students in both US and Europe, and (2) managed and conscientious effort by every one of the PIs to include undergraduate and graduate students with diverse backgrounds in this project. The US summer school will be offered in cooperation with the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) at the University of California, Irvine and will be planned and taught by all of the PIs in the US. The EC counterpart will also offer a similar program at CEASAR. Several of the PIs have experience with planning and executing such programs. To ensure diversity in recruitment, one of the PIs (Thornton) will be in charge of contacting high school teachers and researchers<br/>at targeted schools directly to identify talents in under-represented groups. In addition, PIs will attend and judge local science fairs at the high school level and utilize such forums as a ground for outreach activities.

In particular, the PI plans to investigate the global (in space) properties of stationary Allen-Cahn equation and related equations. The goal is to completely classify all entire solutions for two dimensional spaces, and classify certain entire solutions in higher dimensions. The PI will also study the singular sets of minimizers of a vector valued Allen-Cahn equation which appears in the analysis of multiple phase segregation. The goal is to rigorously prove the formation of triple junction for general convex domains and to obtain the dynamics of the triple junctions. The PI will also investigate theoretically a new level set method for image segmentation which gets rid of re-initialization in numerical computations.<br/><br/>The research will shed a light on the finer structure near interfaces between different materials and phases,and help to develop more efficient techniques for image segmentations and registrations, which are very important for medical science and other areas.

The PI intends to apply both analytic self-consistent field theory and Monte Carlo simulation, a combination which has proved fruitful in the past. His recent studies have shown a new pathway for fusion which is different from that previously expected. Further, he and his collaborators have been able to calculate the energy barriers encountered in the fusion process.<br/><br/>His previous studies were carried out on planar bilayer membranes consisting of but a single amphiphile. Biological membranes are not so simple, and so his objective is to determine how various factors characteristic of realistic membranes affect the fusion process. He will apply his methods to the study of membranes with several components. As in biological membranes, they will be restricted to one leaf of the bilayer or the other. Also to be studied are small spherical vesicles like those within the cell. Finally the effects of fusion<br/>peptides, which are present biologically, on the fusion process will be modeled.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>It is expected that the work will have application to controlling fusion events, both in technological applications and in biological ones. Among the former, one can cite the possible use of polymeric vesicles whose properties can be tuned. Fusion events are necessary in order that these vesicles deliver their cargoes appropriately. The number of biological processes dependent upon fusion are legion, but two can be cited here; control of fusion in HIV therapy, and its encouragement in non-viral drug delivery. The work will involve the training of a post-doctoral fellow and, later in the grant, a student. It will be disseminated at national meetings and colloquia, and also in the classroom in the PI's course Introduction to Biological Physics which is aimed at seniors and graduate students.<br/>***

Kennedy of the University of Michigan Ann Arbor is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop capillary electrophoresis methods to detect and quantify protein-protein interactions and to measure enzymatic activity. The model binding systems that will be investigated include G proteins, regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins), and SH2-domain proteins that bind phosphoproteins. The enzymatic systems include G-protein hydrolysis of GTP and adenylyl cylcase catalyzed formation of cyclic-AMP. Detection of the effects of receptor agonists and protein regulators of these reactions will be demonstrated. <br/> Life processes rely on affinity interactions between proteins to regulate when and where chemical reactions occur in cells. Advancements in understanding the chemistry of life rely on methods, such as those developed here, for quantifying affinity interactions. The methods will also be adapted to screening of natural product mixtures and libraries of pharmaceuticals for high-throughput discovery of drugs that alter these interactions. The work will involve high-level training of students with experience in both instrument development and biochemistry to support the scientific infrastructure.

Seven or so well-known scientists are invited to St. Louis to talk to an audience of about 400, including numerous undergraduates and graduate students. Most of the audience comes from colleges and universities within a five-hour drive of St. Louis but there are usually people here from about 35 states. They come to hear a progress report on what is happening in various areas of plant and animal biology, namely how these organisms are classified and how we study their relationships with one another. The talks are published in the Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, and they have become a useful teaching tool. NSF funding, which has already supported 50 of the 52 symposia, is used to pay the travel and housing costs of the speakers, a portion of the secretarial costs, and a portion of the publication costs of the proceedings. There is a mix of male and female speakers, with the aim of matching the gender ratio of the audience if at all possible. The audience usually arrives on a Friday, the talks take place on Saturday, and people depart on Sunday. This year, there are demonstrations of computer software on the Sunday morning of the symposium weekend.<br/><br/>For numerous members of the audience, the Systematics Symposium is their first exposure to systematics (the study of classification and relationships of organisms) on a grand scale. They get to meet scientists from a wide array of schools, to arrange internships, to choose mentors for graduate work, and to develop future working relationships. They also get their first chance to visit one of the major plant collections in the world and to use a world-class botanical library. For some of the younger speakers too, the Systematics Symposium is a major turning point in their academic careers. Many members of the audience teach at smaller schools and colleges and the symposium is their chance to meet and talk with colleagues with similar scientific interests, to strike up new collaborations, and to meet with potential graduate students and interns. Altogether, the Systematics Symposium is a major catalyst of scientific interaction in the center of the nation.

Proper activity of some of these transport proteins depends on their localization to one specific part of the cell membrane. The goal of this project is to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which these membrane transport proteins are directed to the proper place in the cell. The study focuses on the AXR4 gene, which has been shown in the widely-studied plant Arabidopsis thaliana to be necessary for proper location of a protein that imports the hormone auxin. Genetic and molecular approaches will be used to identify genes and proteins that interact with AXR4 and act in the same pathway, which will reveal the cellular role of the AXR4 gene product. The project will enhance our knowledge of basic mechanisms of plant cell function, which may ultimately enable scientists to improve the growth of important crop plants. The project also will support the training in modern research techniques of undergraduates and master's students at a teaching-oriented institution.

While think tanks have contributed to national, state, and local politics for nearly a century, their recent history is marked by a number of important changes, both quantitative and qualitative, organizational and strategic. These changes include a dramatic increase in the number of American think tanks, from fewer than 35 in the 1960s to over 300 today, as well as notable shifts in their character, composition, tactics, and funding. The study's central aim is to investigate the causes and consequences of these changes. What caused the transformation of American think tanks? What role have think tanks played in the conservative movement? How have the growth and transformation of the think tank sector affected the overall system of relations through which intellectuals participate in American politics? Based on research conducted in Washington, DC, New York City, and Madison, Wisconsin, the study takes as its anchor the field analysis method devised by Pierre Bourdieu. It draws empirical evidence from a mixture of archival records, statistical data, 'segmented' ethnographic observation at several think tanks, and in-depth interviews with representatives from policy research organizations and related institutions. The study will contribute to two areas of sociological knowledge - political sociology and the sociology of knowledge and intellectuals - by using the history of think tanks as a context for evaluating and extending theories of the political role of intellectuals in the United States. The study will also expand our knowledge about the history of the American conservative movement. The results of the proposed research will be disseminated through a series of scholarly journal articles and one monograph published by a university press.

The idea is to utilize advanced data mining and visualization techniques to analyze citation links among papers in the approximately 1300 journals related to chemistry, biochemistry and the life sciences over the past 30 years. Knowledge domain maps will be employed to communicate the growth of both fields of science over time as well as their inter-citations patterns. The work plan includes data cleaning and parsing, mapping and analyzing the structure of the domains, identification of interdisciplinary information producers and consumers, diffusion of information studies, and validation in cooperation with domain experts in chemistry and the life sciences.<br/><br/>This proof-of-concept project will create baseline visualizations that show the potential of knowledge domain mapping techniques to better inform decisions on programs that require accurate knowledge of the current science and technology infrastructure. New opportunities in the interdisciplinary areas between chemistry and biology merit study in order for the research community to evaluate the best next steps. This project will support graduate students in a research university/research lab collaboration. The activity is timely, as the development and utilization of visualizations is facilitated by the explosion of information available digitally, the decreasing cost of storage and computing power, the development of fast graphics processors, as well as expanding connectivity between systems.

The cleanroom has received construction funding from federal and state sources, and major equipment from private sector sources. The deep reactive ion etcher, and the parylene coater provided by NSF MRI will enable the cleanroom to support not only conventional semiconductor processes, but to also support fabrication of bio- microelectromechanical systems (bio-MEMS). In particular, this equipment will allow UNM to make bio-MEMS devices with deep channels, for example, and biocompatible coatings needed for implantable devices. Specific devices might include implantable drug delivery devices, micro-scale ultrasound emitters and detectors for more localized imaging, micro-scale cancer treatment probes, photonics-based cell sorters, and micro-motors on a chip. Applications will extend to the diagnosis and treatment of human disease, sensors and actuators needed for space missions, or monitoring of environmental pollutants, toxins and infectious agents. In addition to research and development support, the requested equipment, set within the MTTC Cleanroom, will be available to co-train a diverse population of engineering students at UNM with technicians from regional community colleges (CCs). And, the equipment will be available for private companies to prove the manufacturability of a device prior to large-scale manufacturing.

However, despite its critical importance, today's Internet is extremely fragile and suffers from frequent attacks. One of the main reasons for the security vulnerabilities of today's Internet is that the Internet protocols and architecture were designed for a trustworthy environment. This assumption is clearly no longer valid in today's Internet, connecting millions of people, computers, and corporations distributed throughout the world. Many researchers have studied how to secure the Internet, mostly by proposing patches to address current vulnerabilities. However, partial solutions and ad hoc mechanisms often do not address the root cause of the problems, and hence will not be able to eradicate the current problems and prevent them from manifesting in different forms in the future. Moreover, security patches and ad hoc security solutions increase network complexity, which in turn increases vulnerability. Thus, we need a radical new design for a next-generation Internet, which is designed ground-up from sound principles. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The principal investigators (PIs) plan a series of efforts to engage the community in systematically exploring this important question of how to provide the next-generation Internet with a set of fundamental security design principles and mechanisms that will provide the next generation Internet with provable security guarantees. One part of the planning effort is one or more workshops. Starting from a clean-slate approach, participants in the workshops will investigate the fundamental issues in designing a secure next generation Internet, which not only removes many of the current security problems but also provides provable security guarantees against unforeseen future attacks. The deployment of a next-generation secure Internet will likely start out as a research test bed. Such an infrastructure will attract applications requiring high-assurance, resulting in a transition of hosts to the secure Internet. The success of such a test bed critically depends on the collaboration of researchers in networking, architecture, and security. A distributed effort with many small projects is unlikely to have the same impact as a coordinated collaborative research effort. This planning effort will provide coordination of research efforts and establishing community consensus for promising research directions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This effort will involve the networking and security communities to establish a consensus on what security properties to provide in the network, and to establish promising research directions for designing a secure next-generation secure Internet. Included in this effort is a workshop with 30-40 networking and security experts from industry and academia to further explore and define a research direction for the next-generation secure Internet. The PIs will produce a report to communicate the results from this planning activity to the broader research community. Through a series of meetings, organized discussions, presentations, this effort will build a roadmap and help the community to reach consensus on what the important research directions are and how the different research efforts work together to achieve the desired goal of designing and implementing a testbed of an architecture for a next-generation secure Internet.

This research project will take the comprehensive approach of integrating selective material use with societal constraints that include consumer behavior and government policy considerations necessary to achieve the goal of sustainable e-waste management. <br/>The broader impacts of this project are significant, given that in that this electronic age people depend on several electronic devices to cope with the pace of modern society, households own multiple cell phones, computers, cameras, video game players, portable music recorders, calculators, and personal digital assistants. These electronic products can contain many hazardous materials such as toxic metals and brominated flame-retardants that may ultimately impair the environment and human health. Society faces growing problems with electronic waste (e-waste). Designing strategies to manage e-waste has proven to be an extremely complex and multifaceted challenge. The effectiveness of top-down policies such as those in the EU and Japan is questionable because environmental laws have at best a regional influence whereas electronic product markets are global. This project takes a comprehensive bottom-up approach where the multidisciplinary research team of engineers, material scientists, environmental health and policy scientists, economists, and student trainees will develop quantitative modeling tools needed to guide the development of environmentally-benign electronic products. Using the cell phone as an example, our research focuses on optimizing the convergence of three factors (1) Identification of cost-effective non-hazardous material components that do not compromise product reliability (2) Assessment of consumer preferences for recycling and willingness to pay for environmentally-benign electronics, and (3) Comparative analysis of effective regulatory policies that transcend state and national boundaries regarding materials use in electronic product engineering and e-waste management. A new collaboration between the university and the local science museum, Explorit, will focus on creating programs for K-12 students that demonstrate how the games, cell phones and other consumer electronics currently impact the waste-stream and will engage students in creating sustainable e-waste projects.
0518819	New Approaches for Investigating Brain-Body Scaling and the Evolution of Mammalian Brains	IOS	ENVIRON & STRUCTURAL SYS CL	08/01/2005	07/18/2005	Kenneth Catania	TN	Vanderbilt University	Standard Grant	Martha Flanders	07/31/2008	$388,554.00		ken.catania@vanderbilt.edu	Sponsored Programs Administratio	Nashville	TN	372350002	6153222631	BIO	7474	9150, 9183, BIOT	$0.00	New Approaches for Investigating Brain-Body Scaling and the Evolution of Mammalian Brains<br/><br/><br/> The significance of brain size in behavior and intelligence remains a fundamental area of study in the neurosciences. For well over a century biologists have been interested in how brain size scales with increasing body size and what this suggests about behavioral complexity in different species. Humans and other primates in particular have a much larger brain than would be predicted for our body size and this is thought to underlie our unique intellectual abilities. In this project, Dr. Catania will test the hypothesis that animals with more sensory input or more complex motor behavior have larger brains than would be predicted from their body size to process the greater input or output. Specifically he will investigate the scaling relationship between body size and brain size and the degree of sensory or motor specializations in moles (Family Talpidae) and shrews (Family Soricidae). These species are well-suited for such studies because these mammals share many brain features in common with other mammals and humans, but have particularly clear subdivisions in the higher processing, neocortical areas. These clear brain subdivisions are not visible in larger brained mammals. Studying shrews and moles will allow precise quantification of areas in the brain that can be related to the degree of development of the visual, somatosensory, or auditory senses in each species. The specific data that will be collected include counts of inputs (afferents) to the brain and counts of output (efferents) from the brain. In addition, the quantities will be compared with brain size and body size in individuals from each species. The primary goal of these studies is to reveal previously unidentified relationships between brain size, body size, and sensory abilities. Ultimately the research may inform us about scaling principles general to mammalian brains that will help us to understand the evolution of intelligence.

The study will focus upon the following aspects:<br/><br/>1. The use of level-set modeling to define the burnt and unburnt interfaces of turbulent flow.<br/>2. In the continuous regions bounded by such interfaces, mesh-free radial basis functions will be used in conjunction with the level-set methodology.<br/><br/>The mesh-free radial basis function method will be used to time advance the solution in the interior continuous regions. We shall use the Greedy algorithm developed by Prof. Robert Schaback at Goetingen University. This algorithm is shown to be very efficient since it only uses those data centers important to reduce the residual errors at a fraction of the computational time required by finite element methods. In addition, a moving-data-center scheme will be implemented to further reduce both spatial and temporal truncation errors. This scheme will be constrained to conserve mass, momentum components and total energy at each time advance. We intend to publish our results in two parts: A. A detailed description of the numerical algorithm, and B.

Caruso<br/>Department of Science and Technology Studies<br/>Cornell University<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/>Soldiers do not own their bodies: their bodies belong to the state. When a soldier<br/>becomes injured during wartime, military medical personnel are trapped in the position of<br/>serving two masters: they are responsible for the health of the soldier as well as the health of the military establishment. Military and medical personnel were forced to come to an agreement about how to treat injured soldiers throughout the First World War. The soldier became the site of conflict between two different institutions, each of which had its own forms of knowledge production and its own conceptions of, and requirements for, that knowledge. By examining the technologies of triage-the process of sorting, categorizing, and treating injured and ill soldiers-and the conflict that arose between military and medical personnel over how soldiers should and would be classified, this project will enhance our understanding of the transformations  that occurred in the American military and medical institutions during and after World War One.   More generally, the project will demonstrate the effects that inter-institutional settings have on the production of knowledge.<br/><br/>This NSF grant will provide the opportunity to visit archives in the United States in order to investigate the first-hand accounts of soldiers practicing and receiving medical care during wartime. Such research will allow for assessment of the ways in which science, in the form of medicine, was practiced and how technologies were used in inter-institutional settings.  Those conditions promoted new discoveries and innovations that could then be adapted for use by military and medical institutions separately.  This project will offer insights into the ways in which military and medical practices and goals had to be adapted to allow for cooperation between the representatives of each institution.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>Such work will shed light on the way that science (medicine) is practiced when in the<br/>service of two powerful political institutions. Much attention has been paid to the ways in which science interacts with other powerful, formalized institutions like the law, as well as to the ways that powerful institutions like the military can influence scientific goals. But neither of the above-mentioned cases deals with science being developed and practiced under the watchful gaze of another institution's authority.<br/><br/>

J. Wang, T. Marks, and L. M. Keer<br/>Northwestern University<br/><br/>An in-situ novel lubrication approach using a soft metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process is proposed for accomplishing 1) deposition/replenishment through the in-situ-MOCVD process, 2) solid lubrication at high temperatures for normal operation, 3) liquid metal lubrication at extremely high temperatures for sustained maximum power delivery, and 4) self-healing against thermally induced failures. The proposed research involves synthesizing, characterizing, and evaluating silver-based metal-organic compounds with tailor-made thermal properties and decomposition pathways. It is expected that metal-organic compounds developed with a wide range of decomposition temperatures and different soft metals will be a class of novel high-temperature lubricants. The results of the proposed research will provide a better understanding of the mechanistic nature of silver growth processes on metal surfaces and how such growth depends on precursor ligation, deposition conditions, and deposition technique. A significant advance in high-temperature lubrication would have great economic benefit. Moreover, a highly interactive, interdisciplinary project will provide a challenging environment for student training.

They present results of their preliminary experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of their idea of magnetic field induced surface diffusion and request funding to explore this new phenomenon further to achieve better control over the process, gain a fundamental understanding and also develop it into a novel nano-manufacturing technique for ferromagnetic surfaces. In addition to the experimental investigation, the proposed research includes development of an analytical framework to describe the kinetics and a quantitative description of the phenomenon. <br/><br/>Fabrication of controlled and ordered patterns of nanostructures of technological interest has been the focus of several research efforts during the past decade. An example of such efforts is the strain induced self-assembly in semiconductor thin films that exploits an elastic configurational force that arises as a consequence of the competition between elastic energy and surface energy in minimizing the system free energy. A relevant question in this context of nanoscale assembly and fabrication is whether there are other kinds of configurational forces at nanoscale that act on solid surfaces, which can be exploited to drive ordered and controlled structure growth. In case of ferromagnetic surfaces, this proposal (i) demonstrates the existence of a magnetic configurational force and presents supporting preliminary experimental evidence and (ii) seeks to explore it further in a systematic experimental program. This configurational/driving force results from the competition between magnetic field energy and surface energy. Under favorable conditions, the magnetic configurational force can induce surface shape evolution through surface diffusion. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in exploring a new concept of driving surface diffusion in ferromagnetic materials using magnetic field. This concept has not been discussed or reported before. Based on this new idea, the proposal also aims to develop a new nanofabrication tool to accomplish guided assembly of patterns of nanostructures with any desired spatial location and size distribution. The proposed research also aims to develop an analytical description of the phenomenon by introducing the concept of magneto-elastic chemical potential. The research will be based on a synergistic interdisciplinary collaboration between the principal investigator and his collaborator, with respective backgrounds in Applied Mechanics and Materials Science. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed research lies in (i) wide and effective dissemination of the insights gained through this research, (ii) training a graduate student as part of his/her Ph.D. program, (iii) providing research and educational opportunities to undergraduate students from a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) and (iv) interacting with Brown's NSF supported MRSEC program to include this research project in the Research Experience for Teachers (RET) outreach program. The graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will be provided opportunities to participate in research conferences to present their work and gain valuable career experience.

Upwelling is a defining factor of El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) in the eastern Pacific, particularly along the coast of Peru. Historical records of this phenomenon are limited and older proxy records in this region are few. The proposal will exploit the ventilation age difference between equatorial surface and deeper upwelled waters. The detection of El Nino events will be made by screening for shell increment alteration and by sequential d18O analysis. The simultaneous excursions in d 18O and D14C in molluscan shell identify periods of upwelling variation caused by El Ninos. By providing data of Peruvian Holocene upwelling this project will provide understanding of paleo-ENSO and give insight into past deep water circulation. Furthermore, the large increase in the database of regional D R data will improve age-dating in many disciplines. Broader impacts of this research also include graduate and undergraduate student training through participation in all stages of research.

Mesostructure refers to features within a part that have sizes between micro and macro-scales, for example, small truss structures, honeycombs, and foams. To achieve this goal, research from the design, CAD, optimization, mechanics, and manufacturing areas will be integrated. A method and software system will be developed to synthesize parts and compliant mechanisms in 2D and 3D. Research advances in the areas of multi-scale mechanics modeling, geometric modeling, compliant mechanism synthesis, and topology optimization are expected. Part and mechanism designs will be fabricated using additive manufacturing (rapid prototyping) machines to demonstrate and test the resulting system. It is expected that this research will establish a design process that will take advantage of the capability of additive processing to realize hetergeneous and complex structures that cannot be achieved by traditional manufacturing methods. <br/><br/>If successful, this research could provide a significant benefit to society by providing products that utilize material much more efficiently than currently possible, leading to improved fuel economy for cars and planes, robot arms with better performance (lighter weight), prosthetics that adapt to their wearers, and improved filtration media (designed compliance can aid solid-liquid separation), among other benefits. Other broader impacts will be achieved. Graduate and undergraduate students will be recruited from under-represented groups. Research results will be incorporated into several graduate and undergraduate courses. Additionally, advances will contribute to theory and methods for design across multiple size scales. These advances are expected to apply beyond engineering design to mechanics of materials, manufacturing, materials science fields.

The objectives of the project are to provide technical students with continuous quality improvement (CQI) experience, to recruit more students into engineering design, manufacturing, and electronics, and to improve student performance. The revised curricula bring freshmen into the CQI loop in their first semester technical courses where they analyze and recommend improvements on products previously designed by student teams. In succeeding semesters, the students build prototypes, analyze them, and continue to redesign them. They undergo training in workplace skills, including project management, teamwork, problem solving, critical thinking, and communication. In the last semester, the curricula combine technical and business students to form student teams or companies, which manufacture, market, and sell a product. To meet the recruiting objective, the project uses student teams as a magnet to draw high school technical instructors and their students to the campus and uses video streaming technology to delivers project activities to the high schools. To improve student performance, the initiatives include: (1) creating a leadership track for promising high school students, enrolling them in a class designed to improve their success in college, and utilizing them as mentors; (2) addressing the language needs of non-native speakers of English by assessing their skills and providing assistance, especially in speaking and listening skills; and (3) involving industry representatives in an advisory committee and utilizing them as mentors. The evaluation effort is comprehensive using a variety of approaches from several perspectives at various points in the students' development. The dissemination efforts includes outreach to high schools and plans to publish materials and results on a web site, at conferences, in journals, and through a workshop.

Berkowitz	07/31/2009	$467,070.00		larkinr@msu.edu	Office of Sponsored Programs	East Lansing	MI	488242600	5173555040	BIO	7473	9183, BIOT	$0.00	Plants are sessile organisms that use solar energy to fuel their growth and development. The process plants use to convert solar energy into biologically useful forms of energy is called photosynthesis. Being immobile, plants must adapt to the ever-changing environment. To survive extremes in environmental variation, photosynthesis must be especially malleable and tightly controlled. Photosynthesis and much of the process of plant metabolism are performed in specialized cellular compartments called plastids. For plants to integrate fluctuating environmental signals with their intrinsic developmental programs, it is essential that plastids send information on the status of photosynthesis and other plastid-localized metabolism to other cellular compartments. Plastid signals regulate photosynthesis largely by controlling gene expression in the nucleus, the compartment of the plant cell that contains most of the plant genes. The goal of the proposed work is to identify and characterize the plastid signals and the plastid-to-nucleus signaling mechanisms that plants use to regulate the expression of nuclear genes active in photosynthesis. <br/><br/>This project will explore plastid-to-nucleus signaling that occurs during the development of chloroplasts, a specialized type of plastid that carries out photosynthesis. Previous studies indicate that at least two signaling pathways send information from plastids to the nucleus during the process of chloroplast development. Accumulation of a particular precursor of chlorophyll, the green pigment that plants use to harvest solar energy for photosynthesis, is a signal that regulates one of these pathways. However, the mechanism by which chlorophyll precursor accumulation within plastids is communicated to other cellular compartments is not understood. The two main objectives of this project are (1) to thoroughly characterize the role of GUN4, a recently-discovered chlorophyll precursor-binding protein, in plastid-to-nucleus signaling and the regulation of chlorophyll synthesis; and (2) to identify additional plastid signals and components of plastid-to-nucleus signaling pathways. The results from this work are expected to help us understand how plastid signals regulate the expression of nuclear genes with functions related to photosynthesis.<br/><br/>Broader educational and agricultural impact of the proposed work<br/>Because plastid development and function have a dramatic impact on the expression of many nuclear genes that encode proteins active in photosynthesis, the information generated by these experiments will begin to fill a significant gap in our understanding of plant growth and development and may be useful for rational genetic engineering of agronomically significant plants. Additionally, this project will provide training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scientists. The results generated from this project will enhance the teaching activities of the project leader. This project will also contribute to the broad dissemination of knowledge at local, national, and international scientific meetings.

Within the next five years, IC design will further change as it will be possible to provide enough transistors on a single chip for on the order of a hundred 16-bit processors. The systems will be designed to meet their performance goals through the exploitation of task level parallelism. These software-intensive systems will require modeling capabilities far beyond traditional computer-aided design tools. While software engineering techniques also contribute as design aids, they do not address the important aspect of performance; a key goal in the design of real, constrained systems. Central to the performance of these systems is the scheduling of the concurrent tasks onto concurrent processing elements. <br/><br/>Bottlenecks at one point in the system can cause system-wide performance degradations. This research will investigate defining a new level of modeling for the design of single-chip heterogeneous multiprocessing systems. The project will investigate the development of the underlying models that include processing resources, application tasks, and schedulers , and will develop a diagnostic aid based on the concurrent system model, and a simulator to be made available on a website. This research will define, demonstrate, and teach a new level of computer system modeling.

Elias to work with Dr. Andrew C. Mason at the University of Toronto and with Dr. Wayne P. Maddison at the University of British Columbia, in Canada.<br/><br/>The complexity of natural environments presents an overwhelming diversity of potential stimuli. Information from multiple sensory inputs must be integrated within the nervous system in order for an organism to navigate its environment. Neural mechanisms of sensory integration have evolved to reflect the adaptive significance of competing stimuli, and explaining sensory integration therefore requires a thorough understanding of the function of behavioral responses. The PI and his hosts will study multimodal communication in jumping spiders of the genus Habronattus using behavioral, phylogenetic and information theoretic techniques. Multimodal communication (communication using two or more sensory modalities) represents a context in which multi-sensory integration can be clearly linked with a specific behavioral function, and therefore provides an ideal system to study sensory integration. Studying the evolution of multimodal communication will provide insights into the processes that drive the integration of multiple inputs which will, in turn, guide the analysis of neural function to uncover fundamental mechanisms underlying sensory integration and communication. They are studying communication in different species of Habronattus that use multimodal signaling to varying degrees in male courtship displays. Mate choice experiments along with quantitative measurements of male signals allow them to evaluate existing hypotheses on the function multimodal signals and therefore the significance of specific mechanisms of sensory integration. Using phylogenetic techniques and computational models they are empirically testing hypotheses on the evolution of greater signal complexity as well as testing the hypothesis that greater signal complexity leads to more rapid species diversification. <br/><br/>This project can bridge the gap between describing the complexity of a communication system, understanding the system's role in sexual selection and understanding the evolutionary pressures that may increase system complexity.

Tools that extract information from databases and provide information to resolve some of the involved uncertainties in selection of therapy strategies are necessary. Unfortunately,existing databases are marred with imperfections ranging from missing information to data entry errors and subjective evaluations. In machine learning, data imperfections have received inadequate attention,which is surprising in view of the abundance of mathematical frameworks developed by the decades of research in the .eld of uncertainty processing. In the proposed work, a team of three researchers will address the research tasks that will enhance the physician 's decision-making capabilities by gleaning actionable knowledge from relevant databases. These tasks include detection of frequently co-occurring diseases that require association mining in time-varying domains with ambiguities and uncertainties, prediction of the success of specific treatments, with special attention to induction from sparse and unreliable data, prediction of a patient non-compliance with a focus on ambiguous attributes and statistical and medical validation of the knowledge.<br/><br/>The proposed research will contribute to computer science along the following three lines. 1) Modification of existing techniques for association mining so that they can work with ambiguities and can quantify the uncertainty of the results. Techniques that reflect the time-varying nature of the induced knowledge will also be developed. 2) Development of a novel clustering algorithm (based on collaborative filtering) capable of ignoring the descriptions of the training examples, and modification of existing collaborative-filtering techniques so that they can handle data imperfections. 3) Development of machine-learning techniques for classifier induction from ambiguously described examples. All of these three contributions can be used in knowledge discovery from imperfect databases. In the medical domain, the induced knowledge will provide new hypotheses as well as new treatment strategies.<br/><br/>This research project involves a multidisciplinary collaboration of professionals from<br/>different disciplines. The medical students involved will learn to appreciate how modern computer science techniques can enhance medical practice,while the engineering students will learn about the complications encountered in medical applications of computer science. Outreach activities to develop the participation of high school and community college students will be developed. The University of Miami is a Hispanic Serving Institution; the proposed research will involve under-represented student groups in engineering research. Activities on broad dissemination of research results via publications and presentations, incorporation of theoretical and experimental work into courses, and by contribution to relevant Internet sites.

The purpose is to determine the distribution and kinematics (deformational style) of late Paleozoic deformation across Nevada. The conventional understanding of the evolution of western North America recognizes only two orogenic (mountain-building) events during Paleozoic time. However, this team of investigators has found unequivocal evidence for previously-unrecognized Mississippian, Pennsylvanian and Permian contractional deformation events in the Pinon Range and Adobe Range, Nevada. Their work, along with published mapping by numerous other workers, indicates that these events may be widespread. This broad geographic extent and temporal persistence of contraction between the previously recognized orogenies raises some fundamental questions regarding the tectonic processes acting on western North America in Late Paleozoic time. This project is extending the investigation north to the Idaho border, and south into eastern California. This study has the potential to revise current thinking about unifying tectonic models for the Paleozoic evolution of western North America. It will, unequivocally, result in a better understanding of the extent, geometry, kinematics and timing of Late Paleozoic deformation in Nevada. It may also result in a reinterpretation of when and why contractional deformation occurred in the western part of the continent.<br/><br/>The results of this study will be of use to the mining and energy industries, because of the importance of these rocks and structures to producing and trapping hydrocarbons and to hosting gold deposits in Nevada. They may also relate to groundwater supplies for the ever-growing population of Nevada, because the structures may disrupt or displace aquifers. Research results from these workers are already being used to build more accurate hydrologic models locally in southern Nevada.

In particular, a hitherto unused non-amide frequency has been discovered that is conformation sensitive, and the aim of this research is to establish all of the expected correlations between structure and spectrum that will enable the use of this band in the determination of peptide and protein structure. The theoretical work consists of quantum mechanical calculations of representative conformations of di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-peptides to firmly establish the vibrational frequencies to be associated with C(alpha)D(alpha) groups in various positions and structural states, both in isolated molecules and ones to which water molecules are hydrogen bonded to the peptide groups. Factors which are being examined include: a) influence of the amino acid side chain; b) influence of charged end groups; c) influence of position in chain; d) kinds of conformations; and e) effect of the neighboring (i.e. not directly hydrogen-bonded) water medium.

Nanoscale moving systems are currently the subject of intense interest due in part to their potential applications in nanomachinery, nanoscale assembly, robotics, tribology, fluidics, and chemical/biochemical sensing. Most of the research in this area has focused on using biological motor proteins in artificial systems, or using molecular motors such as rotaxanes that are powered externally. However, nanomotors can be constructed from scratch which mimic biological motors by using catalytic reactions to create forces based on chemical gradients. These motors are autonomous in that they do not require external electric, magnetic, or optical fields as energy sources. Instead, the input energy is supplied locally and chemically. The studies will provide a scientific underpinning for future applications of catalytically driven motion on the nanometer length scale. Specifically, this research will focus on: (1) exploring the range of catalytic reactions that can be used to convert chemical energy to motion on the nanometer and micron length scales; (2) chemical, photochemical, and electro/magnetic switching of motion; (3) fundamental engineering studies on energy efficiency and load-bearing ability of the nanomotors; and (4) first-generation devices such as gear assemblies, sensors, and switchable nano- and microscale pumps based on the mechanical forces produced by catalytic reactions.<br/><br/>An educational outreach program will be implemented that combines new efforts with key contributions to established NSF programs. These efforts focus on introducing cross-disciplinary nanoscience concepts related to nanoscale chemical motors into graduate and undergraduate courses, middle school summer science camps, and science teacher workshops.

Most of the multiresolution techniques in use are nonredundant, that is, the underlying mathematical structures used are bases. However, many of today's applications require some redundancy in the system.<br/><br/>The requirement of redundancy requires a mathematical structure more general than bases, termed frames. Although the initial work on frames dates back to the 1950s, frames have become more popular only recently, mostly due to emerging applications requiring tools which provide redundancy. A fair amount of work has already been done on frames; however, their level of maturity is nowhere near that of wavelets. This is about to change as a host of applications requires redundancy offered by frames; the theory needs to follow fast.<br/><br/>This research addresses gaps in the current knowledge and solves some of the open questions in frames. These are related to the characterization of certain classes as well as the construction of a frame toolbox motivated by problems in bioimaging, biometrics and robust transmission. Developing the frame theory to this extent brings frames to the level of maturity of wavelets and significantly expands the multiresolution toolbox.

The proposed research will focus on resonant<br/>interaction of optical fields with metallic nanoparticles and on<br/>negative refractive index phenomena in optical materials with double<br/>resonance (electric and magnetic field). We will study nonlinear<br/>coupling of material and light excitations and their applications.<br/>Traditional resonant optics which is limited to exploiting resonance<br/>of electric fields with atomic systems revolutionized science and<br/>technology by introducing lasers. Current development in nanomaterial<br/>fabrication makes it possible to add an additional resonant<br/>interaction, that of a magnetic field with the embedded nanostructure.<br/>This brings exotic properties such as negative refractive index into<br/>the optical domain. It is important to study the properties of such<br/>materials using consistently derived equations that describe the<br/>doubly resonant interaction. This is considerably more challenging<br/>than simply including negative values for permittivity and<br/>permeability. We will develop a description of the optical double<br/>resonance phenomena starting from first principles and analyze its<br/>physical consequences including negative refractive index. We will<br/>also analyze the classical phenomena of nonlinear optics in doubly<br/>resonant materials. Our pilot research with ultra-short pulses has<br/>already shown that for very simple nanomaterials, optical control<br/>using phase, including trapping of light is feasible.<br/><br/>Broader impact: This project will make important contributions to <br/>basic science. It can lead to applications in materials science and<br/>to high performance computing. One of the principle targets of the<br/>work is negative refractive index material. These materials could be<br/>of great practical value. Optimization of the design of such<br/>materials will be a central result of our research and requires a<br/>fundamental understanding of the nature of the interaction of light<br/>and such nano-structures. One of the more important applications for<br/>negative refractive index materials is superlenses. Such a lens<br/>permits much improved focusing of light compared to current<br/>capabilities. This would allow production of electronic components<br/>using photolithography with much higher densities and finer features<br/>leading to greatly increased computation power and lower cost. In<br/>addition, other types of nano-optical materials can lead to novel<br/>optical logic devices and short term memory buffers. Designer optical<br/>materials are very close to realization; their full potential will<br/>only be realized if the fundamental physical and mathematical models<br/>are understood.

By careful analyses of detailed structural chemical data, made possible by the enhanced capabilities of the new instrument, the five major users will: (i) address the relationship between ligand design and catalytic behavior of organometallic compounds as catalysts for carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom coupling reactions and carbon-hydrogen bond activation; (ii) expedite total synthesis and methods development by determination of the structure and stereochemistry of intermediates and final products in real time; (iii) explore the origin of enantioselectivity in practical and efficient organic catalysis; and (iv) promote the control of reaction products and stereochemistry using the solid state as a synthetic medium.<br/><br/>The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, especially synthetic chemistry.

Both courses contain investigative laboratory modules (labs) that emphasize the process of science and data analysis relevant for science and social science students. Much of the material in the 1st course is being adapted from DUE-9950476 A Data-Oriented, Active Learning, Post-Calculus Introduction to Statistical Concepts, Methods, and Theory (ISCAT). The 2nd course extends ISCAT and utilizes integrative research-based lab methodology currently used in science courses at Grinnell College (partially funded by DUE-9950289). Labs in both courses are being developed so that they can be individually integrated into many courses in both undergraduate statistics and other disciplines.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is to contribute to the scholarship of statistics education by developing material that expands the successful reforms of the algebra-based introductory statistics course and inquiry-based science courses into early statistics courses designed for students with strong quantitative skills and interests. This collaborative project aims to deepen the statistical knowledge of undergraduates who are future scientists and quantitative social scientists in order to strengthen the interdisciplinary dialog between statisticians and scientific investigators in the future. The project also addresses a 2004 CUPM Guide recommendation by developing a series of labs that emphasize data analysis and encourage students to collect data, determine an appropriate technique for analysis, use technology, perform the analysis, make inference, interpret and then present the results. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project include creation of models for mathematics, technology and science students to develop interdisciplinary data analysis and research skills by creating a 2nd course in statistics that easily fits into existing curricula at many institutions. This allows institutions that may not be able to add new courses to their curriculum to incorporate a few labs into a standard probability course or other science courses, thereby increasing the quantitative skills of students majoring in other disciplines. The development of the laboratory modules brings together information across many disciplines and increases collaboration between faculty in the physical, biological and social sciences. This material is being disseminated through presentations at professional meetings, by publication in statistics education journals, and online at CAUSEweb (#DUE-0333672). As modeled by ISCAT, dissemination of these labs includes data and simulations that are accessible through a variety of data analysis tools such as Excel, Minitab, Stata, R, and java applets on the internet.

The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.<br/><br/>This award will support a twenty-two-month research fellowship by Dr. Amy E. Zanne to work with Dr. Mark Westoby at Macquarie University in Australia for eleven months, and with Dr. David Ackerly at the University of California, Berkeley for eleven months.<br/><br/>Existing theory suggests xylem hydraulic conductance (related to vessel diameter) should be negatively related to mechanical strength (related to wood density and vessel wall thickness) and the ability to avoid drought-induced embolisms (air bubbles blocking water flow). It is unclear whether these hydraulic traits are tightly linked to the orthogonal spectra of leaf and twig size or leaf structure and longevity, or whether they represent their own major spectrum of trait variation. This 22-month project quantifies how these traits differ across seasons, annual rainfall, and species biogeographic histories. It also examines relationships between plant hydraulics and these other major spectra. Studies of plant trait spectra form the basis for much of the work in the Westoby and Ackerly labs. The project will be conducted at sites along a coastal to inland rainfall gradient in New South Wales, Australia, and hydraulic traits will be measured during two summer and winter seasons. Many key leaf properties have already been documented at these sites (e.g. leaf lifespan, structure, size, nutrient content, and gas exchange rates), making them ideal locations for this project. The project will entail three steps. First, trait variation will be evaluated relative to site rainfall and season. Second, species plasticity will be examined on seedlings of species from the two sites varying widely in hydraulic properties. Finally, species traits will be compared across sites in Australia based on species biogeographic histories, using analyses from Ackerly's lab. Dr. Westoby will support field and laboratory research in Australia, and Dr. Ackerly will support biogeographic analyses.<br/><br/>This project builds important conceptual bridges between plant hydraulics and other key plant trait spectra and will complement ongoing projects in Australia (Westoby) and California (Ackerly). It will substantially increase understanding of plant responses to changing environments (relevant for predicting global climate change impacts).

Such a sensor will be needed after the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) mandates the use of nitrogen-enriched air to prevent explosions like the one that destroyed TWA flight 800. Currently available oxygen sensors cannot withstand the harsh environment and meet the accuracy, longevity, and cost requirements. The technical objectives are to completely characterize and understand the permeation properties of the polymer matrix; examine alternative formulations of the polymer; completely understand the photochemical, leaching, and spectroscopic properties of the phosphorescent dye, examine other candidate dyes, and conduct long-term testing. A flight test of the oxygen sensor is planned. <br/><br/>This research will ultimately benefit society by making air travel safer. It will also serve as a model for the interplay between fundamental science, applied science, and the engineering disciplines during product development. The work will open the door for development of other luminescent sensors that can be deployed in comparably harsh chemical environments, including the measurement of water in fuels and alcohols.

Point-referenced spatial<br/>data arises in several fields, including atmospheric science, ecology, <br/>environmental science, and epidemiology. In fact, often such data is <br/>replicated across time say through sampling at monitoring sites. In <br/>certain cases, with appropriate preliminary manipulation, the<br/>replicates may be viewed as independent. More often, the temporal <br/>dependence is retained and, discretizing time, a time series of<br/>spatial processes emerges. In either case, virtually all of the<br/>modeling for the spatial processes is specified parametrically; in fact, <br/>it is almost always a Gaussian process which is most frequently<br/>assumed to be stationary. The investigators study new classes of <br/>nonparametric spatial models to remove these assumptions. These models <br/>are applicable to either of the above replicated settings. In its <br/>simplest form, the investigators use Dirichlet processes to create <br/>random spatial processes, which are non-Gaussian, nonstationary, and <br/>have non-homogeneous variance. These processes are defined through<br/>their finite dimensional distributions, and are referred to as spatial <br/>Dirichlet processes. A spatial Dirichlet process is then convolved<br/>with a pure error process to create an illustrative spatial process<br/>with a nugget component. Such models are hierarchical and can be<br/>fitted through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In application, the <br/>investigators use spatial Dirichlet processes to introduce spatial<br/>random effects into the modeling, either directly with independent <br/>replicates or embedded within a dynamic model to handle temporal <br/>dependence. The investigators study an assortment of problems<br/>associated with the use of spatial Dirichlet processes, including<br/>their theoretical global and local properties; their use as mixing<br/>models; their use with semiparametric mixing; their implementation in <br/>dynamic models; their utilization for interpolation at given time<br/>points and for forecasting at future time points; their use with <br/>non-Gaussian first stage specifications for the data; their use in <br/>describing multivariate distributions and, as a special case, for <br/>extended regression modeling; their use in modeling spatial point <br/>process data; and their extension to richer classes of so-called <br/>generalized spatial Dirichlet processes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Point-referenced spatial data arises in application areas as diverse <br/>as environmental science, climatology, ecology, epidemiology, and<br/>real estate markets. As researchers collect more and more space and <br/>space-time data, the need for analyses to enhance their understanding <br/>of the complex processes they are sampling grows. This inspires the <br/>need for sufficiently rich models to accommodate a variety of global<br/>and local behaviors. The primary motivation for this research is to <br/>expand the catalog of space-time modeling tools available to such <br/>scientists. This research work suggests the first approach to <br/>nonparametric Bayesian spatial and spatio-temporal data analysis. <br/>Nonparametric Bayesian approaches have witnessed increased utilization <br/>in recent years as a result of their successful application to certain <br/>problems in, for example, engineering and biomedical fields.<br/>Similar success is anticipated by bringing this methodology to <br/>space-time settings. In particular, it is anticipated that, for fields <br/>such as epidemiology, environmental contamination and weather<br/>modeling, researchers will value the flexible modeling framework the <br/>work offers. And, an increase in usage of the methodology is expected <br/>as the computational techniques to fit the models are advanced.

Such transistor will not suffer the short channel (small size) effects of conventional FETs, and therefore very suitable for nano-dimension applications. The advantage of band-to-band tunneling source is that the off current is not limited by diffusion and therefore the Ion/Ioff is extremely large. It also allows ballistic transport and therefore the on-current is much greater than sub-15nm silicon MOSFET. Simulation shows that such transistor can yield an Ion/Ioff better than 104 times and Ion several times achievable by conventional decameter MOSFETs. This revolutionary device can potentially start a new paradigm for nano-scaled silicon transistors.<br/><br/>The success of this research will resolve many of the difficulties identified by the ITRS roadmap, such as voltage scaling, Ioff limitation and Ion degradation, allowing an exciting path for silicon CMOS to extend into sub10-nm regime. The transistor proposed here is a revolutionary approach, yet maintain the basic flavor of decameter MOSFETs. It can therefore be implemented using the well developed CMOS technology. If successful, the impact to semiconductor industry can be extremely significant. It is also an excellent research area for students. Besides investigating the fundamental device physics of these novel transistors, they can gain insights into the operation of deeply scaled MOSFETs, which can be extremely valuable when they eventually work for the industry. To increase their education experience, woman and under-represented minority students will be actively recruited for this research.

Indeed, while message-passing (iterative) processing is very successful in practice, understanding its limitations and its sources of non-optimal behavior has been elusive. Despite the enormous impact that message-passing algorithms have, in particular in a communication scenario, practical systems currently rely almost exclusively on a simulation-based evaluation. In this situation, understanding the behavior and geometry of message-passing will not only reduce the necessity of simulations but provide powerful tools for system optimization.<br/><br/>This proposal draws on recent exciting developments that connect message-passing algorithms to the well established theory of convex optimization. As it turns out, message-passing algorithms are intimately related to a linear programming formulation of the inference task at hand. In fact, belief propagation algorithms may be interpreted as an efficient duality-based method to closely approximate the solution to a linear program. Once such connections are established the investigators will strive to understand message-passing algorithms from an entirely new and fruitful point of view. Also, the investigators have already shown that the connection to convex optimization is rooted in the basic property of message-passing algorithms, namely that they operate only locally in a given graphical model. Thus the findings resulting from the approach investigated here will apply to any reasonable locally-operating algorithm.

However, all estimates agree on a common point: the current estimates of soil erosion rates are one to three orders of magnitude greater than estimates of average soil formation rates, a disturbing conclusion considering the importance of soils to society.<br/><br/>The scientific merit of this proposal lies in addressing a clear need for a better system tracking and disseminating information regarding weathering and soil formation. Our proposed initiative will investigate the following question: How does Earth's weathering engine transform rock into soil to nourish ecosystems, shape terrestrial landscapes, and control atmospheric carbon dioxide? The answer requires coupling physical, chemical, and biological processes over a range of spatial and temporal scales and involves a variety of scientific and engineering disciplines.<br/><br/>Traditionally, terrestrial low-temperature geochemists and soil chemists have worked in small, single or double PI projects. Very few large, multi-PI projects that cross scales and disciplines have developed from within this community. In contrast, among other scientific communities, large programs have developed to organize scientists into coordinated multi-university teams. For example, IRIS and COSEE have been extremely successful in generating enthusiasm and interest in the seismology and oceanography communities. We propose a new paradigm, a Weathering System Science Consortium (WSSC), to forge this type of multi-PI approach to weathering science and environmental biogeochemistry among terrestrial low-temperature geochemists and soil chemists/biologists.<br/><br/> To lay the groundwork for the proposed WSSC, we are requesting funding for two workshops, a symposium at the 18th World Congress of Soil Science in 2006 in Philadelphia that will feature leading scientists who will discuss research frontiers and needs concerning the critical zone, and a database specialist. The current vision for WSSC incorporates four components: 1) a set of node sites for data collection; 2) a network of backbone soil sites that will be investigated for a standard set of weathering parameters over a range of depths; 3) technical support for instrument and sample node sites and backbone sites and coordinated data management and sample storage systems; and 4) the integration of these efforts through a variety of community-building approaches.<br/><br/> The broader impacts of this funding request include the following: 1) improved understanding of the current diversity of questions within the fields of weathering science and environmental biogeochemistry; 2) improved understanding by US scientists of weathering initiatives occurring abroad; 3) development of a coordinated plan to quantify weathering rates in diverse settings; 4) development of a plan to standardize data gathering in the field of weathering science; 5) development of a plan to store and disseminate data from weathering sites worldwide for use by the entire natural sciences community; and 6) organization of the scientific community to investigate fundamental questions in weathering science with great relevance to human society and natural ecosystems.

Methods include real time observation of the automaton dynamics and has a potential for an algorithmic control and modification of DNA strands and genes. Theoretically, the design of the automaton calls for investigations of new types of splicing systems. The process for scaling up the computations may lead to a new crypto system as well as more rapid tests for genetic disorders that are triggered by a combination of mutations. Very few individuals enter the field of DNA-based computation with proper preparation. We will attempt to provide some solutions to this problem during the course of the project. All graduates, undergraduates and high school students who participate in this work will be trained and prepared as unique interdisciplinary research scientists. We anticipate that three graduate students will receive graduate training through this award.

0514581	Doctoral Dissertation Research: Transformation of the Middle Classes in Lima, Peru	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY, EAPSI	08/01/2005	07/28/2005	Tanya Luhrmann	IL	University of Chicago	Standard Grant	Deborah Winslow	07/31/2006	$12,000.00		tluhrman@uchicago.edu	5801 South Ellis Avenue	Chicago	IL	606375418	7737028669	SBE	1390, 7316	5926, 5977, 7316, 9179, SMET	$0.00	Throughout Latin America, scholars have mourned the fall of the region's middle classes due to the inflation and unemployment accompanying market reforms. But in Peru, while some report the demise of the 'traditional' criollo middle class, others celebrate the creation of an emerging middle class, consisting of second and third generation Andean migrants who achieved upward mobility through the urban informal economy. It seems that Peru's middle classes are not shrinking, as in other Latin American nations, but are expanding and diversifying, transforming one of the region's most hierarchical societies in the process. This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropologist will investigate the twin puzzle of the Peruvian middle classes through a comparative study of how families from two middle class groups in Lima, Peru have adjusted to neoliberal policies. The Peruvian middle classes is an ideal site for studying this because it offers a natural case in which two groups each with distinct sets of practices and mentalities confront the same market reforms in a shared social space. This study hypothesizes that differing kinship relations and the distinct emphases the Andean and criollo mentalities placed on working and saving activities explain the practices the two groups developed in response to market policies. This is investigated through a comparative analysis of (1) rationalizations of family budgets and resources (saving) and (2) use and rationalization of time and how it organizes daily production activities (working) in the two groups. This conceptual focus on practices will generate new testable hypotheses not about the causal relation between values and social structure, but about how these emerge from relational practices that are both structured by and structuring of mentalities.<br/>Broader Impact: This research, in addition to training a young scholar, offers a more complex understanding of the effects of neoliberal reforms in Latin America by focusing on the reasons behind the rise and fall of middle class groups and the influence this has on the emergence of democratic and free market institutions. Such knowledge will be of special interest to those concerned with how particular cultural practices mediate the effects of political economic reforms.<br/>This project is jointly supported by NSF's Cultural Anthropology and Office of International Science Americas programs.

Each of 100 child-parent dyads will work on three tasks, one representing each of three content strands, number, algebra, and geometry while being recorded on audio- and videotape. These recordings will be coded to determine gender-related differences in parents' and children's use of cognitively demanding language, by counting the number of conceptual questions, causal explanations, or specific use of mathematics vocabulary during tasks. Data will be gathered on children's self-efficacy and parent's competence beliefs for their children to determine how these related to the cognitively demanding language used by the four types of child-parent dyads (daughter-mother, son-mother, daughter-father, son-father).<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The results of this research will add knowledge and understanding of gender differences that exist when parents and children of diverse ethnicities with low socioeconomic status work on mathematical tasks together. The Pisa (2003) findings that self-efficacy is one of the strongest predictors of student performance indicate the importance of examining the relationship of self-efficacy of children and parents' competence beliefs to the use of cognitively demanding language. Previous related research focused primarily on highly-educated European-American parents. The plan includes careful and thorough development and piloting of mathematical tasks and instruments with 20 child-parent dyads prior to working with the study population. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The findings from the proposed research will help determine ways parent materials and parent involvement programs should address the gender differences in language and actions of parents and their children when working on mathematical tasks similar to those found in reform mathematics curricula. This research results will be of interest to many stakeholders in mathematics education and parent education. <br/><br/>Participants in the proposed research will be students from underrepresented groups: females, diverse ethnicities, and low socioeconomic status. It is anticipated that the findings will lead to broader participation of these groups in mathematics.

Hess	01/31/2008	$215,675.00		igalsz@northwestern.edu	Young Hall	West Lafayette	IN	479072114	7654941055	MPS	1765	1589, 7237, 7488, 9161, AMPP	$0.00	This collaborative grant involving researchers at Wisconsin, Northwestern and Purdue has been made in response to a proposal submitted to the NSF-EC solicitation sponsored by the Division of Materials Research in coordination with the European Commission.<br/><br/>Recent experiments have shown that liquid crystalline materials are capable of probing the structure of interfaces having chemical or topographical features of nanometer length-scales. The ability of liquid crystals to detect the adsorption of proteins or viruses at surfaces or interfaces has been exploited for development of highly effective and inexpensive biological sensors. The principle of operation for these sensors is an anchoring transition of the liquid crystal material at a surface, triggered by the binding of a biological molecule or organism to a substrate. This transition leads to formation of defects, which propagate over macroscopic length scales. This cascade of defects provides the basis for a remarkable amplification mechanism, making possible the detection of a few binding events by simple optical means.<br/><br/>While the use of liquid crystals for sensing applications has been focused on solid surfaces, recent studies suggest that liquid-liquid interfaces could also be used for sensing, thereby paving the way for development of more versatile sensing devices, and development of novel technologies capable of interrogating the structure of interfaces with nanometer level resolution. For such devices and technologies to be quantitative (as opposed to purely qualitative), it will be necessary to develop a theoretical formalism capable of providing a direct correspondence between macroscopic experimental measurements (e.g. optical micrographs) and anchoring transitions and specific binding events occurring at the scale of nanometers. That formalism is inherently multi-scale, in that it must be capable of capturing anchoring transitions occurring at the level of a few liquid crystal molecules while being able to describe the formation of defects over micrometer length scales. <br/><br/>A hierarchical, multi-scale modeling approach is proposed for description of liquid-crystal based chemical and biological sensors. A diverse and unique team of scientists and engineers from the US and the EC has been assembled, all of them with complementary backgrounds and expertise. A carefully orchestrated set of modeling activities is proposed which capitalizes on the strengths of individuals and exploits synergisms between the groups of M.Olvera, J.de Pablo, I.Szleifer, M.Laso, H.Ottinger, and D.Theodorou. <br/><br/>The proposed hierarchical multi-scale approach starts from atomistic models of water, surfactant and peptide amphiphile laden interfaces, and liquid crystals. Residue-level models are used for biological molecules. These models will be coarse grained, using recently proposed methods from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The resulting coarse grain models will be fed into single-molecule and field theories to <br/>map out the structure and phase behavior of the systems of interest over wide ranges of parameter space. The theories will be used to predict the formation of nanostructured patterns at interfaces, which can subsequently be exploited to bind specific proteins and even growth factors for cell capture. The theories will also be used to provide potentials of mean force and other relevant structural information, which will <br/>be fed into field-theoretic and lattice Boltzmann descriptions of defect dynamics in liquid crystals, over macroscopic length scales both at and beyond equilibrium. Solution of these dynamic models will be implemented within the context of novel, grid-less numerical techniques. A final, global effort will consider solution of the entire multi-scale system within a micro-macro formalism that will simultaneously resolve the dynamics of molecules in effective fields and the macroscopic conservation equations.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The sensor systems envisaged in this proposal are particularly complex. They include multiple species, small and large molecules, charges, interfaces, and are often encountered in far from equilibrium situations. They exhibit a rich structural, phase and dynamical behavior that spans many length and time scales. Given this complexity, past theoretical and numerical studies have been largely <br/>limited to select, isolated elements or components of the systems considered in this proposal. There are few, if any precedents for describing the adsorption of biological molecules to peptide amphiphile and surfactant laden interfaces at a molecular level, and for describing the concomitant response of a coexisting liquid crystalline material to that adsorption process over nanoscopic and mesoscopic length <br/>scales, with full consideration of hydrodynamic effects. This proposal describes a multi-pronged, concerted plan of research that brings some of the best, state-of-the-art theory and simulation to the study of such processes. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Sensor design has become an area of central importance to science and technology. The biological sciences will benefit considerably from devices capable of detecting the occurrence of proteins in real time, medicine will benefit from faster, reliable sensors for minute amounts of proteins, and society in general will benefit from inexpensive and reliable sensors for chemical toxins and viral <br/>agents. Recent published reports indicate that the sensors to be explored in this proposal offer unusual promise on all of those fronts. Such reports also underline the fact that the usefulness and promise of liquid-crystal based sensing devices can only be fully realized by developing detailed multi-scale models and a fundamental understanding of the processes that occur in such systems over various length and time <br/>scales. The multi-scale formalism to be developed in this project will not only facilitate considerably the design and development of sensors, but will also permit development of quantitative, liquid-crystal based techniques to probe the structure and properties of interfaces.

The project deals with two new areas, coupled ferroelectric-magnetic phenomena in multiferroic materials, and large strain enhancements in ferroic and multiferroic material properties. The approach combines amplitude, phase, polarization, spectroscopy and imaging in second and third order nonlinear optical measurements to study strained ferroics and multiferroics. The aim is to understand domain structure, electrical-magnetic domain coupling and dynamics, and phase transitions. Also, simultaneous in-situ dielectric and magneto-dielectric measurements will be performed to correlate electrical, magnetic and optical responses from multiferroics for understanding coupled magnetic-ferroelectric phenomena. Collaborations on first principles theory, phenomenological modeling, film synthesis, crystal growth, x-ray and electron microscopy characterization, and magnetic measurements are integral to the project. <br/>Nontechnical.<br/>Broader Impact: The project addresses fundamental materials research with strong technological relevance to electronics and photonics, and effectively integrates research and education. The project facilitates interdisciplinary education of students in collaborative interactions. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the project allowing them to gain hands-on experience in forefront research. The PI will capitalize on Penn State-Women in Science & Engineering (WISE) Week, and SROP (Summer Research Opportunity Program for minority students) -for continuing a workshop on The Science and Technology of Light for high school girls and underrepresented groups annually.

0514333	Doctoral Dissertation Research: Cooperation and Segementary Descent Groups in the Beq'aa Valley of Lebanon	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY	07/01/2005	07/13/2005	Lee Cronk	NJ	Rutgers University New Brunswick	Standard Grant	Deborah Winslow	06/30/2006	$11,000.00		LeeCronk@rci.rutgers.edu	33 Knightsbridge Road	Piscataway	NJ	088543925	8489320150	SBE	1390	9179, SMET	$0.00	During the governmental void created by the Lebanese civil war (1975-1990), the segmentary descent groups of the Beq'aa gained power by providing their members with benefits such as physical security, financial assistance, medical services and job opportunities. This created group solidarity which made the groups stronger. Fourteen years after the civil war, the government is reclaiming power, but the descent groups of the Beq'aa continue to be almost as strong as before the war and still provide similar services to their members thus generating mutual benefit to individuals and loyalty to the group. Members express loyalty to their groups despite increasing opposition from community members and the possibly high costs involved in clan membership. This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropologist will study factors supporting the persistence of corporate descent groups, and compare them to factors promoting alternative institutions such as the local community. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, this project explores the dynamics of cooperative behavior, loyalty and solidarity in segmentary descent groups in the contemporary Middle East. The project will shed light on how such groups provide an alternative to the state by providing public goods usually provided by states (e.g., security) and on how such actions engender loyalty and motivate cooperation among group members.<br/><br/>This project has broader impacts involving attempts at social reform, which are often driven mostly by force while lacking relevant local information. The research will expand Western knowledge of societies with strong segmentary descent groups and the loyalties these groups engender to gain power and sometimes to resist social change. Understanding the role descent plays in organizing the social structure and promoting cooperation will be helpful to planners and NGOs concerned with understanding local economic processes and economic development in these rural areas. The project also advances the education of a young social scientist.

A major focus of marine biology today is to try to see into this black box of where and how larvae disperse, as this has significant consequences for understanding and conserving marine animals and plants. The goal of this study is to better understand the role of stepping-stones of habitat in connecting distant populations to each other through larval dispersal. This goal will be achieved through a comparison of the population genetics of marine snail species that are able to use waterless atolls as stepping-stones to those of their close freshwater relatives that cannot. It is hypothesized that populations of the marine species will be better connected to one another than populations of freshwater species even though both have marine larvae.<br/><br/>It has long been assumed that fisheries and populations of marine organisms were inexhaustible because they could always be replenished from elsewhere. The recent collapse of many fisheries, combined with recent studies of marine population genetics, have shown that this is not the case; larvae may often return to their birthplace, or only disperse for a short distance. If this is so, it will be important to set up marine reserves in networks so that they are close enough together to catch larvae that disperse from neighboring reserves in a manner that is similar to the function of terrestrial greenbelts or corridors. An understanding of how natural marine stepping-stones work will be important to this effort.
0514559	Doctoral Dissertation Research: Food Sharing in Lamalera, Indonesia: Tests of Adaptive Hypotheses	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY	09/15/2005	07/29/2005	Eric Smith	WA	University of Washington	Standard Grant	Deborah Winslow	08/31/2007	$11,875.00		easmith@u.washington.edu	4333 Brooklyn Ave NE	Seattle	WA	981950001	2065434043	SBE	1390	9179, SMET	$0.00	The people of Lamalera, Indonesia are subsistence marine foragers who practice open sea hunting of large prey as well as small boat hook and line and net fishing. The distribution of food follows a complex system of norms that assigns share rights to individuals according to their role in production. Once shares are distributed, shareholders further distribute portions to other households. This redistribution of food resources creates a network of food sharing relationships among households in the village. This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropologist seeks to understand from an evolutionary and economic standpoint how such a system may develop and how the resulting sharing network relates to other local social institutions. The objective is to test hypotheses derived from human behavioral ecology, which look at the effects of kinship on patterns of sharing, how sharing serves to ameliorate variation in harvests over time and guards against the hazard of a serious resource shortfall, and how sharing can be used as a social strategy to gain improved reputation and favor from others. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Anthropologists have long recognized food sharing as a socially and evolutionarily important human institution. In reconstructing the behavioral evolution of our species food sharing has often been viewed as part of a suite of interrelated adaptations that define the hominid lineage, and as a precursor to more complex cooperative behaviors. However, cooperative behaviors that benefit another individual at a cost to the actor can be difficult for evolution to produce. Food sharing is such a behavior, and explaining why humans share food from an evolutionary point of view has become an important focus of research in human behavioral ecology. Because some other forms of cooperation observed in humans face similar obstacles, understanding food-sharing behavior helps us understand human cooperation and sociality more broadly.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Understanding the nature of food production and distribution in subsistence economies helps us understand the material and social resources available to the many impoverished peoples of the developing world. Networks of food sharing, such as that seen in Lamalera, are common in subsistence economies. These networks shape individuals' access to both food and non-food resources. Knowledge generated by the study may therefore have implications for the design of development projects, the distribution of food aid, the execution of disaster relief, or other situations where there is concern about how local institutions may shape access to resources provided by outside agencies. In addition the project advances the education of a young social scientist.

This pipeline has three major components. An education and research enrichment program for 7-12th grade Native American students will integrate indigenous knowledge into the geosciences and provide research experiences for teachers who work in schools with a high percentage of Native American students. An introductory undergraduate geoscience course will integrate indigenous knowledge into the geosciences, use Native American Art as a vehicle of learning, and acknowledge the learning styles of Native American students. An internship program will provide research internship opportunities in the geosciences to Native American students. <br/>The enrichment program for 7-12th grade Native American students, operated cooperatively by the Native American Studies program and the College of Geosciences at OU, includes: a) a one-day geoscience workshop at OU for approximately 100 Native American students featuring group discussions, hands-on laboratories, a discussion of career paths, and a one-day science fair; b) geoscience education and outreach programs for schools, parents, tribal elders, community leaders, and the general public; and c) the Geosciences American Indian Math and Science Society's summer Research Institute for 15 to 30 participants in two one-week summer sessions. The introductory undergraduate geoscience course follows an Earth Systems Science approach and includes a connectedness with the planet theme. The research internship program provides opportunities for Native American students to work at the forefront of geosciences research with faculty in geography, geology, and meteorology. The University will provide funding for an Outreach Coordinator for two years at 50% FTE after the grant has ended to sustain the project.

Service-learning and experiential learning methods, when integrated into STEM curriculum, result in positive attitudes towards these fields and increase the likelihood of students pursuing further education in these areas.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>This project is providing a simple mechanism to inform a significant group of K-12 STEM educators of  strategies available to incorporate service learning and experiential learning into their curriculum in order to encourage students to pursue careers in these fields.  By developing a central repository for these educational resources, and making this resource user-friendly and easily accessible, educators are more likely to implement them in their curriculum. The project is evaluating, distilling, and classifying the most easy-to-use, inexpensive, and effective methods.<br/><br/>By helping students to make the connections between STEM subjects and real-world issues, the educational strategies are expected to increase student interest in STEM disciplines, enrich learning experiences for students, and enhance the skills of STEM educators on the content and application of STEM subjects. The strategies have been shown to enhance the interest of girls and other under-represented populations in these fields.<br/><br/>The PI has extensive experience in incorporating service learning into science and engineering curriculum.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Educators will more easily tie basic STEM principles to real-life applications and will promote service learning as a method of teaching course content as well as social responsibility and ethics, and show students the human side of science, math and engineering.  The project is expected to 1) promote the entry of women and minorities into the STEM fields, 2) increase the potential pool of engineers and scientists in the U.S., 3) contribute to the development of STEM educators, and 4) enhance cultural sensitivity, ethics and social responsibility in future STEM workers.  <br/>

One of the most exciting avenues in contemporary biology is the synthesis of mechanistic and evolutionary approaches, the integration of evolutionary theory and field study with knowledge of the detailed processes that underlie complex traits. This approach has been tremendously successful in understanding the diversification of body plans, and is poised to make comparable contributions in the realm of animal behavior. The evolution of rodent mating systems is a particularly fruitful avenue for synthesizing the contributions of ultimate and proximate factors to the emergence of complex behavioral phenotypes. Thus, a workshop is proposed to assess the status of research in rodent mating systems, and to outline a strategy for catalyzing a synthesis of the relevant fields. The workshop will bring together a diverse array of 15 researchers by discipline, as well as by gender, minority status, and professional stage. The specific aims of the workshop are to: (1) summarize existing knowledge in ecology, behavior, and neurobiology of rodent mating systems; (2) examine the technical and conceptual hurdles within disciplines; (3) examine the empirical data and social infrastructure needed to effectively accomplish a synthesis; and (4) disseminate the workshop in two publications directed at diverse audiences. By design, the workshop is both broad and concrete, with the inclusion of junior researchers postdoctoral associates and assistant professors), it will share expertise from scientists less entrenched in their respective disciplines, and will also foster their involvement in collaborative research. Many leading researchers in the field are women reflected in the gender composition of the participants (8 of 15 invitees), and one woman is a minority. Broadening participation also means the inclusion of respected researchers who are at small schools. The resulting group of invitees is diverse in every dimension except research excellence, all participants have solid records. The workshop promises not only to critically assess the integrative study of behavior, but includes leading teacher/scholars in the development and communication of such efforts.

Bamboos are economically important as building materials and household items (among many other uses) and are ecologically significant as a key component of many remnant habitats that preserve threatened and endangered plant and animal species. Despite this importance, bamboo diversity and evolutionary relationships (= family tree or phylogeny) are poorly known relative to other grasses and bamboo classification remains unstable. These issues create difficulties for biologists, conservationists, and those interested in developing bamboo as a sustainable resource. The principal goals of this project are to 1) generate a phylogeny for the bamboos using DNA data, data on the physical structure of bamboos, and innovative analytical and statistical methods; 2) construct a stable classification of bamboos at the genus level that reflects this phylogeny; 3) use the phylogeny to study the evolution and biology of selected features (such as vegetative branching) of these unusual grasses; 4) establish an umbrella Web site for bamboo biodiversity to host a comprehensively illustrated and interactive identification resource to the genera of bamboos and to make information on bamboo biodiversity more readily available to users around the world. An international team of bamboo biologists (the Bamboo Phylogeny Group) with complementary expertise will be established to achieve these goals.<br/><br/>This collaborative effort will result in a much-improved understanding of the evolutionary history and biodiversity of bamboos. A stable generic classification will facilitate communication about bamboos and in conjunction with an accessible identification resource will be valued by a wide range of users, including ecologists, conservation biologists, foresters, biologists, bamboo enthusiasts, architects, engineers, and others interested in developing bamboo as a sustainable resource. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in plant classification and the construction of phylogenies (both important components of systematic biology) as well as current techniques of DNA manipulation and bioinformatics through participation in all phases of the project. Improvements and innovations in analytical methods that result from this project will be applicable to a wide range of fields that use bioinformatics or phylogenetic methods, such as developmental genetics, conservation genetics, genomics, and medical research. Existing museum and living collections will be strengthened through the fieldwork. Results will be widely disseminated to both the general public and the scientific community through presentations, publications, and the Bamboo Biodiversity Web site.

Half of the world's approximately 7000 languages are expected to disappear during the century. This project records speakers in their cultural setting to preserve an understanding of their society. Language goes beyond serving as just a tool for members of a culture, serving as the essential vehicle through which all experience is interpreted, and the medium by which we understand the world we live in. The work digitizes, archives, and analyzes linguistic data to make it accessible, searchable, and interpretable to future generations and encourages not only the preservation of existing digital language documentation but also their creation and analysis. The infrastructure acquired will service the following goals: <br/>- Immediate development of a web portal for endangered languages that will eventually allow access to all language and cultural data in general,<br/>- Training and matriculation of students in language engineering and linguistics, and<br/>- Community outreach.<br/>The research is expected to create the first tool- and data-rich online web portal dedicated to preserving and providing access to documentation of endangered languages, developing tools for data integration, cross-language querying and linguistic analysis. The portal will support interdisciplinary research in ontology, data integration, multimedia data management, language engineering, and security.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project will facilitate the fusion of several disciplines within computer science and the arts and humanities with a single application focus. It will also contribute in establishing a multi-institutional doctoral degree and a graduate student certificate program in Language Engineering. Moreover, the portal will provide outreach support for field linguistics, serving as a source for students at all levels on minority languages and cultures, especially those that have been or are endangered.

Kalman, Principal Investigator) and the University of Vermont (UVM; Dr. Kenneth I. Golden, Principal Investigator).<br/><br/>Strong Coulomb interactions are featured by a variety of physical systems. Of primary interest are laboratory dusty plasmas, charged particles confined in cryogenic traps and storage rings, layered charged particle systems in semiconductor quantum wells, and astrophysical plasmas (giant planetary and white dwarf interiors, e.g.). The joint BC/UVM research project will focus on these systems.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses some of the major theoretical issues related to<br/>Experiments in strongly coupled systems: correlation and static structure functions, thermodynamics (equation of state and phase boundaries), dielectric response and collective mode behavior. Similar issues arise in multi-layer semiconductor plasmas whose consideration also forms a part of the proposed work.<br/><br/>The main approach to be used in the proposed investigations relies on a series of works by the Principal Investigators in which a method especially appropriate for the description of the dynamical behavior of strongly coupled (correlated) plasmas was worked out. This method, referred to as the Quasi-Localized Charge Approximation, was used in the previous funding periods and has provided theoretical, transparent models for the interpretation of laboratory experiments and computer simulations. This analytical work will be paralleled by molecular dynamics simulations done in collaboration with a research group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Budapest)].

This Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Instrument (ARVIN) is designed to allow simultaneous, parallel operation of multiple instruments, actuators, and software/hardware subsystems. Due to the common environment in which the items are operating, the ARVIN yields a precise, robust metric of comparative performance and capability of the item in question. Inherently rapidly reconfigurable by design of its network-centric architecture, the ARVIN enables quick, easy substitutions and augmentations of sensors and actuators on the evaluation platform; it is not a set of identical robot structures that join and reform to move or climb.<br/>The ARWIN tests, simulates, and validates subsystems and components in three tightly coupled hierarchical areas acknowledge as critical to advances in robotics vehicles:<br/>-Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC),<br/>-Sensor and Actuators Suites, and<br/>-Software and Network Architectures.<br/>The Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Instrument consists of an Argo Conquest 6x6 Off-road/Amphibious vehicle, heavily modified, and a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulator for the vehicle. The vehicle will be fitted with ultrasonic sonar and SICK LiDAR for collision avoidance, fiber optic gyros, IMU's, and NavCom STARFIRE differential GPS receivers for guidance, a Pentium class PC-104 stack with high speed communication networks for control, and a Videre MEGA-STC-VAR stereoscopic high speed color camera for vision capture.<br/>In general, due to the incredibly high cost (in time and money) of constructing an autonomous vehicle of any kind, designs are rarely modified unless the mission cannot be completed by the original vehicle design. Very rarely are the initial trade-off studies revisited and explored to see what might have been done differently. Thus, the ARVIN should have profound impact on the kind of trade-off studies that most autonomous vehicle design programs have to-date been missing. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: ARVIN allows students and researchers to gain experience on an actual, physical, autonomous rover. This kind of practical training in systems integration, sensor fusion, software architecture for real-time systems, and actual control systems implementations has much to offer. The Naval Postgraduate School and the Intelligent Robotics Group (IRG) at NASA-Ames has indicated interest and enthusiasm in collaborating and experimenting with the modular chassis that will result of the ARVIN. Contributing to further understand trade-offs for mobile robotics, the platforms will also be used for outreach. The ARVIN infrastructure should become a cost-effective general robotics toll that may be easily replicated at other institutions.

The co-organizers are Professor Marc Fossorier at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu and Professor Ikuo Oka at the Osaka City University in Japan. Information theory is a profoundly international field of study and many of its strongest contributors have come from the US and Japan. It has become a field where the rich and ever evolving conceptual and mathematical structure is being constantly combined with the system constraints and application demands of today. Many of the best-known researchers in the field are known for both their contributions to practice and to theory, and the two are usually closely related. Japan's chapter of the Information Theory (IT) Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is by far its largest chapter. The Board of Governors of the IEEE IT Society suggested that particular efforts should be made to develop collaborations between the US and Japan in this field. Therefore, this workshop was suggested and Hawaii chosen because of its geographical location. The purpose of the meeting is to promote scientific advancement, understanding, and the dissemination of research results in the fields of interest of the Societies that embraces theoretical and certain applied aspects of coding, communication and communication networks, complexity and cryptography, detection and estimation, learning, Shannon theory, and stochastic processes. <br/><br/>The co-organizers have complementary scientific expertise in the field. This enables them to evaluate and attract the best science and mathematician researchers to participate. The seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve postdocs and graduate students as both participants and observers. The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects. Following the seminar the organizers plan to establish a workshop web page. Conference proceedings will be published on this web site.

Yet, a growing number of emerging applications no longer fit such a conventional data model. For instance, in sensor networks and location-aware mobile computing, data is geographically distributed, and in high-volume data monitoring, such as analysis of Internet traffic or web clicks, data must be processed as a stream, without being stored. Motivated by these technological trends, the investigator develops distributed algorithms for geometric computing.<br/><br/>Designing mathematically grounded geometric algorithms for distributed or streaming data is challenging because the algorithms must operate with limited computational resources. In particular, nodes in a sensor network have very limited battery power, memory, and bandwidth, and so collecting data from the network requires nodes to construct approximations of their spatial measurements. Similarly, data stream algorithms must process the data in a single pass and compute synopsis data structures that summarize important features of the data. This research develops novel geometric algorithms and data structures that deal with insufficient resources (bandwidth, memory, power) in a graceful manner, so that the solution quality adapts to the resources available --- the better the resources, higher the solution quality. In particular, the research proposes such resource-adaptive methods to discover epsilon-cuts in sensor networks, compute bounded-memory approximations of sensor observations, discover hierarchical heavy hitters in multi-dimensional data streams, and shape-preserving clustering methods for geometric streams. Many challenges of national importance concern the protection of our physical as well as cyber infrastructures. Being able to monitor these systems remotely and analyze their data with flexible, resource-adaptive, and programmable software tools is critically important. Because many of these systems deal with distributed or streaming data, this research has direct relevance to those applications.

Two interacting modular components are combined: general interface motion under a given velocity, and <br/>the problem-specific velocity of a given moving interface. The first component involves semi-Lagrangian contouring, with fast stable tools for geometric operations such as contouring, distancing and intersection. Efficient algorithms convert between explicit and implicit interface representations with fast computational geometry, robust global topology resolution, and high-order Bezier representations, to track complex surfaces evolving under arbitrary dynamics and topology. The second component requires high-accuracy solution of partial differential systems for material fields, stresses and concentrations, which determine the velocity of the interface. Fast accurate solvers for algebraically complete first-order formulations split Green functions into singular and global terms, and achieve optimal efficiency for elliptic/parabolic systems with complex interfaces. The interface motion and velocity evaluation components connect through new implicit time-stepping schemes which handle sensitive interface velocities stably. The Frechet derivatives incurred in the solution of implicit schemes are systematically decomposed into universal components, and computed by efficiently reusable computational modules.<br/><br/>Mathematical models of complex evolving material interfaces dominate technological processes ranging from semiconductor production to surgery planning, from computer animation to computer-controlled machine tooling. Efficient general computational techniques are crucial in designing better models. The investigators are developing efficient new modular computational tools for simulating technological processes in robust user-friendly ways. This highly interdisciplinary enterprise combines mathematics and computer science to benefit scientific endeavors ranging from cartography to crystallography. The research objectives intertwine with an interdisciplinary educational program, training future scientists and engineers through web-enabled courses, math/science/engineering seminars and individual student research mentoring.

The versatile instrument will be composed of an X-ray generator, X-ray mirrors and lenses, a hybrid monochromator, a high resolution goniometer and sample cradle, slits and collimators, a fast multichannel detector and Xe proportional counter, and a high temperature sample stage. Specific measurement capabilities of the XRD system will include phase analysis, high resolution reciprocal space mapping, pole figure analysis, rocking curve analysis, reflectometry, stress and texture analysis, and topography. State-of-the-art XRD capabilities will be especially valuable to research programs at LASST pertaining to (i) semiconductor gas sensor films and ceramic coatings, (ii) novel piezoelectric single crystals for acoustic wave devices and sensors, and (iii) mesoporous and nanoporous materials for chemical detection and chemical separation. Other materials research projects that will benefit from high resolution XRD analysis include microsystem components and bio-MEMS devices, biomaterials and protein structures, dielectrics for microelectronics, paper coatings, composite materials, nanoparticle probes, cement-based materials, zeolites, and metal catalysts. <br/><br/><br/>University of Maine researchers propose to acquire a state-of-the-art X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Materials Analysis System to investigate the structure of the surfaces of thin film coatings, sensors, and other materials being developed in their laboratory. Detailed information about atomic bonding in materials will enable development of next generation chemical sensors to detect toxic chemicals in the environment, novel protective ceramic coatings for ultra-high temperatures, improved high frequency electronic materials, and membranes for chemical detection and separation. This research will be conducted by UMaine undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, visiting scientists, and collaborators from other colleges and universities, industries, non-profit research institutions, and Maine's public schools. The system will be located in the Laboratory for Surface Science & Technology (LASST), an interdisciplinary research center that brings together UMaine expertise from physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, and biological engineering to solve problems related to surfaces, interfaces, thin films, microdevices, and nanostructured materials. The proposed system, the only of its kind in the State of Maine, will be used in projects with Maine high-tech companies and several start-up companies incubated from LASST research in sensor technology. Educational outreach workshops and demonstrations will be used to teach technology concepts to the general public, middle and high school teachers, high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students participating in other NSF-funded training activities at UMaine.
0510182	Quantifying the Physical and Chemical Controls on Permeability Evolution in Sheared Fractures	EAR	HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES, GEOMECHANICS & GEOMATERIALS	07/15/2005	11/19/2009	Derek Elsworth	PA	Pennsylvania State Univ University Park	Continuing grant	Thomas Torgersen	06/30/2010	$367,745.00	Chris Marone	elsworth@psu.edu	110 Technology Center Building	UNIVERSITY PARK	PA	168027000	8148651372	GEO	1579, 1634	9189, EGCH, 0000, 9251, OTHR, 9178	$0.00	.Elsworth<br/>0510182<br/>Intellectual Merit: The competition between agents that either destroy or generate porosity controls the evolution of the transport properties of fractured rocks. Changes in permeability resulting from chemo-mechanical effects have been shown to occur under modest stresses 2 MPa) and temperatures (T80C, with H2O as the permeant), to be rapid (c. days), of significant magnitude (permeability reductions of 10-2), and moreover, to surprisingly result in permeability reduction even when dissolution net removes mineral mass. <br/>Despite these observations, a consistent view of the processes and indexing parameters that control the switching between porosity generation and destruction in fractures is still sought. Important controls on rates of precipitation and dissolution are exerted by local shear and normal stresses, the chemical potential field, and the evolving topology of the fracture. In turn, these effects mediate the evolution of the transport (permeability) and mechanical properties (stiffness and shear strength) of fractures in rock. This study will clarify how these transformations progress with paths of deviatoric stress, temperature, fluid flux, and chemical potential, and for different fluid saturations.<br/><br/>These effects will be examined via flow-through tests on fractures continuously sheared within a double direct shear loading apparatus to return continuous measurements of evolving permeabilities, stiffnesses, and shear strengths. Tests will be conducted under controlled temperatures (20-300C), flow rates (0-2 cc/min), ambient stresses (0-50 MPa), and under controlled displacement rates (10-106 nm/s) slow enough to approach rates of mineral redistribution within the fracture. Recorded histories of flow impedance, mineral mass efflux, and normal displacement rate, will provide three independent measurements of evolving fracture aperture or porosity, in vivo. These observations, anchored with pre- and post-test fracture surface profilometry ~O(5 m), will provide uniquely constrained micro-mechanical data to support the development of process-based models. Particulate mechanics models will be developed to represent the essential features of two rough surfaces in contact, and to accommodate the birth and destruction of asperities bridging fractures via mechanical and chemical processes. These models will necessarily incorporate the serial processes of stress-mediated dissolution, diffusive transport, and free-face dissolution and precipitation, which together define the evolution of the mechanical and transport characteristics of the fracture. Transport modeling will be via linked Eulerian-Lagrangian methods that accommodate advection dominated flows, that interface with the evolving topology of the particulate mechanics model, and both constrain experimental observations and enable upscaling of the observations to field scale. Results will define critical processes and constrain the magnitudes of strain rates and fluid and mass fluxes where the generation of porosity out-competes its destruction, for a broad range of ambient stresses, temperatures, and paths of chemical potential. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In addition to the broad impacts these transport processes have in the safe entombment of radioactive wastes, the recovery of hydrocarbons, geothermal fluids, and potable water, and in the understanding of fluid cycling within the crust, a number of broader impacts are apparent. These include the cross-disciplinary exchange between the engineering and geophysics communities, the broad training of undergraduate and graduate students, and timely presentation and publication of results in the engineering and scientific literature.

First-principles<br/>theoretical formulations over the past decade have been derived from volume averaging<br/>theorems in which microscopic interfacial behavior is explicitly incorporated. These theories have<br/>proposed that interfacial area per volume directly affects macroscopic behavior, and that this<br/>variable may govern the observed hysteresis in the capillary pressure - saturation relationship.<br/>The scientific objective of this proposal is to measure the evolution of interfaces among<br/>multiple phases in a porous medium. Two- and three-dimensional micro-models will be used to<br/>directly image and quantify the behavior of the interfacial geometry while concurrently measuring<br/>fluid pressures (globally and locally) and fluid flow. The specific scientific goals are: (a) to<br/>determine if an ensemble-averaged relationship among capillary pressure, saturation and<br/>interfacial area per volume may be universal for statistically similar pore distributions, (b) to<br/>quantify the relationship between interfacial geometry, saturation and relative permeability for<br/>steady-state flow conditions, and (c) to determine if the relaxation coefficient associated with<br/>dynamic flow conditions depends on the evolution of the interfacial geometry with time. In<br/>addition, we propose to revolutionize the use of micro-models in the study of fluids in porous<br/>media in two ways: (a) the incorporation of local probes into two-dimensional micro-models to<br/>measure local pressures; and (b) the development of a new two-photon lithographic technique for<br/>creating transparent three-dimensional micro-models that can be directly imaged by using laser<br/>confocal microscopy.<br/>Merit Criteria:<br/>1. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is the acquisition of explicit data sets<br/>connecting interfacial areas, and other relevant geometric micro-scale data, with macroscopic<br/>hydraulic properties on truly three-dimensional micro-models. The proposed combination of<br/>experimental methods and analysis will make it possible for the first time to answer the principal<br/>question of which microscopic properties are most useful for predicting macroscopic flow<br/>properties of a porous medium.<br/>2. The broader impact from the proposed activity will be confirmation/disproof of theoretical<br/>methods used for addressing the prediction of flow and distributions of multiple fluids in a porous<br/>medium which affects applications in oil, gas and water production, ground water protection,<br/>chemical mixing and processing in chemical engineering, and in porous tissue applications of<br/>biology and bioengineering. Our outreach objective is three-fold: (1) To train and educate<br/>graduate and undergraduate students in the science of laboratory research; (2) To work with<br/>science education majors to develop hands-on experiments for grades 7-12; and (3) To integrate<br/>the hands-on experiments into our Physics Outreach Program which reaches students in grades<br/>7-12, as well as parents and teachers throughout Indiana.

Phelan	05/31/2008	$334,198.00		tzeng2@mit.edu	CAMPUS BOX 7514	RALEIGH	NC	276957514	9195152444	ENG	1406	0000, 7237, OTHR	$0.00	Abstract:<br/>Thermal Energy Transport from Nanoparticles to Liquids <br/><br/>This proposal was received as an unsolicited submission to the Chemical and Transport Systems Division and was funded by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program. Incorporating nanoparticles in thermal engineering is a rapidly growing technology. A typical example is a nanoparticle-engineered coolant, which exhibits a significantly higher cooling rate than traditional coolants compared with coolants without nanoparticles added, a feature crucial for thermal management of microelectronics. Nano-biotechnology is another example: heating nanoparticles bonded to biological molecules allows localized heating on the selected molecules, thereby achieving precisely-controlled biochemical reaction without affecting neighboring molecules. For these applications, it is extremely important to understand the mechanisms involved in the transport of thermal energy from the nanoparticle to the surrounding media in order to guide the design of nano-thermal systems. The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to develop a fundamental understanding of nanoscale thermal transport from single nanoparticles to surrounding liquid medium. The research plan includes the development of techniques to precisely measure the temperature distribution of the nanoparticle and its surrounding medium, and the characterization of nanoparticle-liquid structure using advanced photon sources. Advanced modeling of the physical structures of nanoparticles, nanostructures of liquid molecules close to the interface, and thermal energy transport will be developed and applied. The study will reveal how hard materials (solid particles) and soft materials (liquid molecules) are bound together to form different nano- intermediate structures, and how thermal energy is transferred through the nanostructure in hard-soft material systems. It will advance measurement techniques for thermal properties of nanomaterials, and modeling techniques for nano- thermal systems, and ultimately further our fundamental understanding of nanomaterials. The broad impact of the research spans multiple disciplines, including thermal engineering, molecular structure and transport, and bioengineering. The research will also have significant impacts on education. The education plan includes development of new courses on nanotechnology, and recruiting high-school students, undergraduate students, underrepresented students and graduate students to work on the project.

Gatesy<br/>Brown University<br/><br/><br/>The analysis of movement is central to many fields of biological research. Tremendous progress has been made using point-based tracking systems, which calculate the three-dimensional (3-D) coordinates of markers attached to a human or animal subject. However, the detailed motion of internal structures such as bones is often beyond the reach of these superficial techniques. The complex and extremely rapid movements at the shoulder of a flying bird, for example, are not amenable to point-based motion analysis, yet are critical to understanding the biomechanics of flight.<br/>The goal of this SGER project is to demonstrate the power of 'Scientific Rotoscoping,' a promising new method for visualization and analysis of animal motion. Scientific rotoscoping is a morphology-based technique that involves fitting a 3-D computer model created from CT scans of a subject's actual anatomy (the 'key') into three, simultaneously recorded, video images (the 'lock'). As a proof-of-concept, scientific rotoscoping will be employed to collect skeletal and wing feather movement from videos of a pigeon flying in a wind tunnel. Results will be analyzed among and within flight speeds to provide fundamental insights into the control of avian flight, and will have immediate application to aerodynamic, biomechanical, physiological, paleontological, and evolutionary studies of birds. <br/>Scientific rotoscoping entails the innovative integration of existing digital tools (video, fluoroscopy, computed tomography, 3-D animation software). This novel technique will yield high-resolution motion data and scientifically accurate animations unobtainable by any other means, but has been considered too risky for a full proposal. SGER funds are an ideal way to validate the scientific and educational potential of a morphology-based approach.

Bacteria exchange genes between species at a high rate, but the rules governing this exchange are poorly understood despite their importance for understanding microbial evolution and ecology. Restriction-modification (RM) systems appear to play a central gatekeeper role, and their regulation is crucial to both their distribution and the gatekeeper role. A substantial number of RM systems are controlled by small C proteins that activate transcription of their own genes and those of the downstream restriction endonucleases; closely-related C proteins have been found in bacteria as different as E. coli and Bacillus. This is surprising for two reasons. First, broad host range is particularly difficult to achieve among transcriptional activators, which must make productive contacts with a range of RNA polymerases. Second, the C proteins are much smaller than typical transcription activators. The regulatory logic and actions of these unusual activators have received only limited characterization, but the structure for a C protein has recently been determined. The understanding of both transcriptional activation and of RM system function will be improved by studying the remarkable C protein family. Four hypotheses will be tested, focusing on a C protein from the enterobacterium Proteus vulgaris (C.PvuII). First is the hypothesis that the requirement for C.PvuII delays expression of the endonuclease gene pvuIIR relative to that for the protective methyltransferase. This would prevent cell death when the RM system genes move into a new bacterium. Second is the hypothesis that asymmetries in the target sequences (C boxes) serve to modulate C protein binding and affect its behavior as a regulatory switch. Third is the hypothesis that C.PvuII activates transcription via contact to region 4 of RpoD (sigma70), helping to explain the unusually broad host range of the C proteins. Fourth is the hypothesis that C.PvuII and RNA polymerase holoenzyme are necessary and sufficient for in vitro activation of pvuIICR transcription which, again, would help to explain the broad host range. <br/><br/>Broader impacts include graduate student training, including their voluntary participation in teaching activities and attendance at national or international meetings; research training of undergraduates and medical students and continued dissemination of data via publication, seminars, and providing links to articles on the P.I.'s academic web site. Indirect impacts would include teaching in the areas of microbial genetics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics; and development of an educational and research program in bioinformatics and proteomics/genomics.
0510591	Collaborative Research: Linking Deep and Shallow Crustal Processes in a Continental Arc, North Cascades, Washington	EAR	TECTONICS	07/01/2005	07/13/2009	Samuel Bowring	MA	Massachusetts Institute of Technology	Continuing grant	David Fountain	06/30/2010	$229,827.00		sbowring@mit.edu	77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE	Cambridge	MA	021394301	6172531000	GEO	1572	0000	$0.00	Mountain belts formed by collisions between continents, and continental volcanic arcs constructed during compression, have large-scale similarities, including markedly thickened crust. In the past decade, many researchers have tried to explain the large-scale patterns of collisional mountain belts, such as the Himalayas, using models of flow of partially molten mid- to lower crust. In contrast, there have been few studies of crustal flow in exhumed continental arcs. The North Cascades, Washington, is an exhumed Late Cretaceous (circa 90 million years ago) arc, which includes rocks that were once at depths of 35-40 km and are now exposed at the surface. This mountain range also displays evidence for uplift and erosion during formation of adjacent non-marine sedimentary basins in the Eocene (approximately 50-45 million years ago); these basins are filled with the eroded debris. Field-based structural study and laboratory analytical work (geochronology, petrology, microstructural analysis) are being carried out by an interdisciplinary team of geologists to determine the timing of metamorphism, partial melting, exhumation of deep crustal rocks, and basin formation and evolution in the Cascades. These studies are aimed at providing a view of the construction and collapse of a continental arc analogous to the Altiplano region of the modern Andes in Bolivia and Argentina. Much of the research is focused on the Skagit Gneiss Complex of the North Cascades. These rocks record a history of partial melting, which probably occurred during exhumation of the mountain belt. The gneiss is bounded in part by low-angle structures that resemble detachment faults. Relationships between flow of these migmatites and bounding units have not been previously studied, but can provide information about the coupling or decoupling of deep and shallow crustal processes. Kinematics of deformation are being analyzed over a range of structural depths to determine the directions and conditions of crustal flow, and whether flow occurred in a channel parallel or oblique to the edge of the North American plate boundary. Eocene basins that flank the North Cascades contain thick sedimentary sequences deposited by rivers in a system of strike-slip and normal faults. Volcanic tuffs interlayered with the sedimentary rocks facilitate dating of the time of basin initiation, and the rates of deposition. Vast swarms of Eocene dikes intrude both crystalline rocks and basins. A major goal of the mapping and dating of the dikes is to provide a record of regional deformation during exhumation of the mountain belt and basin formation. The orientation of these structures can be compared to the flow directions recorded by the migmatites. This research involves three graduate, undergraduate research assistants, and summer interns. The principal investigators are conducting a field trip to the North Cascades involving students from all three universities, and are publishing an illustrated, data-filled field guide related to the trip and the research results on the internet.

O'Connor	06/30/2006	$11,980.00		ostrom@indiana.edu	509 E 3RD ST	Bloomington	IN	474013654	8128550516	SBE	1321	9179, SMET	$0.00	This doctoral research investigates resource users' responses to agricultural expansion and the role of protected area tenure policies on local land-use decision-making in the Mosquitia Biological Corridor of eastern Honduras and northern Nicaragua. The ability of traditional resource users to craft appropriate conservation institutions in response to economic and demographic changes is hotly contested by both social and natural scientists. In Latin America, increasing pressure for farm and range lands challenge traditional natural resource management systems and threaten previously remote forest lands. This study compares the evolution of local land-use institutions in the context of two UNESCO Biosphere Reserves in the Mosquitia Corridor: the Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve, Honduras and BOSAWAS Biosphere Reserve, Nicaragua. <br/><br/>While the two reserves share similar demographic and ecological characteristics, the Rio Platano management policies have limited residents' rights to the land and its resources. In contrast, BOSAWAS policies have generally enhanced resident resource management and land tenure security. Both reserves are threatened by outside encroachment. In each reserve, community-level case studies will identify current land-use norms, resident perceptions of major changes in land-use and resident perceptions of tenure security. The community studies will be compared to previous anthropological studies of land-use practices in the region and will be combined with an analysis of protected area policies and participatory processes in each reserve. Satellite images will be used to analyze forest cover change with respect to protected area policies and local land-use practices. The different policies related to protected area tenure offer an ideal setting to examine how local communities are responding to agricultural expansion and to test how tenure security influences rule-making and enforcement activities.

The developed numerical tool will determine the optimal price and quantity of remanufactured product a firm should offer to the market based on such input factors as collection cost, refurbishing cost, perceived customer quality differential between the new and remanufactured product, competitive landscape, and presence of environmental legislation. An optimization algorithm incorporating game theory techniques and stochastic dynamic programming will be used and Life Cycle Analysis on selected case studies and scenarios will be performed to quantify the environmental impact. An industry partner will provide data and products to help validate the models. <br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will lead to an increase in the understanding of the strategic importance of the remanufactured product market. Profitable remanufacturing involves the joint optimization of design, recovery, manufacturing and marketing decisions for both the new and remanufactured product lines that take into account the product-line cannibalization effect. For many firms, the remanufactured product is a low-price substitute for the new product and is targeted at low-income customers. Therefore, manufacturers need to determine the target customer segments and product prices for both products jointly to maximize profit. In addition, the initial design decision should take the ease of disassembly and remanufacturing into account. The primary goal of this work is to develop a set of decision support tools that assist the firm in these decisions, thus removing some of the uncertainty and fear of excess product-line cannibalization that currently keeps many firms from remanufacturing today. The proposed work will also directly impact society by pursuing research that aims to reduce the environmental impact of industry while increasing its competitiveness, creating an economic and ecological win-win situation.

The Genetic Analyzer is an automated system that performs DNA sequencing and an array of genotyping and DNA fingerprinting techniques. The Real-Time PCR System quantifies sequences from mixtures of DNA and is especially useful in detecting rare, but functionally important microorganisms in the environment. The two instrument systems will function as multi-user research, research training, and educational molecular biology equipment in the Biology Department at WCU. The instruments are meant to enhance the research capabilities of the Biology faculty and the educational experience of WCU students, as well as to attract new students and researchers to the university. The many applications of these systems will make possible a host of research activities, including evolutionary and genetic studies of species and populations of ecologically and economically significant organisms, forensic biology techniques, and microbial community analysis. <br/><br/>Funding for these instruments will support the investigation of organismal biodiversity using recent innovations in molecular biology. It will greatly expand the molecular biological capabilities of the Biology Department at WCU and will lead to exciting discoveries. Much remains to be learned about the evolutionary history of plants, animals, and microorganisms. A diverse array of organisms will be examined in molecular and genetic studies, and the resulting data will help resolve relationships among organisms from diverse ecosystems. Students will be included in the generation, interpretation, and presentation of data acquired with these instruments, and together faculty and students will publish novel research results. These instruments will also broaden the capabilities and effectiveness of instruction in the classroom and research laboratories and will result in dynamic and creative ways of communicating science to both Biology majors and non-majors at the university. <br/><br/>The project has at its core the intent to train young scientists in biodiversity studies while utilizing the latest in technological advances. The Genomic Analyzer and Real-Time PCR System will provide students with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in molecular-based studies and in obtaining and analyzing genomic datasets. Student interest in biology will be invigorated by the modernization of teaching techniques and laboratory experiences, and better understanding of the modern methods used by biologists to answer scientific questions will be promoted. Furthermore, outreach to underrepresented groups including students from the nearby Cherokee Reservation; women, disabled persons, and minorities; as well as students from the rural, Southern Appalachian local communities will be undertaken. By learning an array of molecular tools, WCU students will be better prepared for advanced studies in biology, for jobs in high-tech industries and education, or simply to become science and technology literate.

To accomplish this task, neurons extend axons that navigate using a dynamic structure at their tips, the growth cone. Growth cones do not swim though the embryo: they crawl along sticky surfaces and advance only by making adhesions. A crucial advance toward understanding these adhesions comes from members of the Tosney lab, who discovered that all adhesions are not equivalent. Instead, two distinct types of adhesions regulate two different motile structures: filopodia that act as a tiny antennae-like sensors, and veils that spread the growth cone forward. Cues in the embryo can guide growth cones by controlling these special adhesions, which in turn control the filopodia and veils. This project will test the hypothesis that these adhesions are regulated by different molecular signals. Researchers will experimentally perturb signals while directly observing labeled molecular components, adhesions and motile structures in live growth cones. Since similar adhesions are crucial components of all moving cells, these studies are key for understanding the movement of multiple cell types, including cells that build the organism during development and cells that endanger the organism during metastasis. <br/><br/>In addition to advancing understanding, the project directly promotes training of graduate, undergraduate and high school students, including those of underrepresented groups. For instance, the PI has already trained three dozen undergraduates in research. Many wrote honors theses, presented their work at interdisciplinary professional meetings, coauthored publications, and advanced to professional training. In addition to disseminating findings in the usual venues of publications and meetings, the PI directs the Society for Developmental Biology Education Website which synthesizes education materials for public presentation. The proposed research project will sustain the mentoring and training of diverse student researchers at multiple levels, as well as the dissemination of research findings and philosophies to wide audiences.

The fundamental mechanisms by which nanoscale ligands<br/>such as dendrimers bind metal ions will be elucidated through a combination of techniques: dendrimer synthesis and characterization, bench scale measurements of proton and metal ion binding, spectroscopic measurements and analysis, and multiscale modeling. In addition to advancing the fundamental science of metal ion chelation by nanoscale ligands, this research could provide insight and guidance to scientists and engineers interested in the use of dendrimers as high capacity chelating agents for industrial separations and templates for the synthesis of metal-bearing nanostructures with electronic, magnetic, optical, and catalytic activity. Two water purification platforms will be emphasized in this project: dendrimer-enhanced filtration systems and dendrimer-based treatment units. The dendrimer enhanced ultrafiltration (DEUF) process combines water-soluble functionalized dendritic polymers with the well-established water purification technology of ultrafiltration. A key objective of this project is to optimize DEUF for the recovery of metal ions from the membrane concentrates of water treatment and desalination plants, thus providing water utilities in the US with more efficient and cost-effective means of treating the problem of brine disposal. Another goal of this project is to explore the use of iron-dendrimer complexes as functional materials for a new generation of membrane-based reactors for water purification. In terms of the broader impacts, this project could provide the water industry with a versatile technology for purifying water contaminated by redox active metal ions such chromium. Similarly, the development of dendrimer-based units that selectively remove copper and lead from water would provide municipalities with novel means of treating contaminants resulting from the dissolution of water delivery pipes. This project will also provide training opportunities in interdisciplinary research for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students at Howard University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the California Institute of Technology.

The research involves the development of models and algorithms that will reduce automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors for natural conversations, which may be exacerbated by realistic but difficult acoustic conditions. Major improvement in algorithm robustness opens a wider range of future applications, including voice access to networked information and information retrieval and extraction for meetings. Head-mounted microphones or microphone arrays may not be feasible due to low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and the effects of reverberation. Integration of multiple estimators, either at the level of probability streams or hypothesized word sequences, with associated confidence measures, can greatly improve overall performance. Research has shown that such properties can significantly increase recognition accuracy, even for high SNR tasks that require the transcription of informal conversational speech. For problems of scale, training of even a single-stream system can take weeks using a 2005-generation PC or workstation. A fast multi-processor system might overcome these resource limitations and greatly enhance the ability to explore promising solutions to the current constraints on performance. Hence, research requiring multiple probability streams or more computationally intensive algorithms should benefit from this new multi-layered system infrastructure.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The planned research supports technical explorations that become the basis of PhD dissertations. Other areas, such as computational biology, natural language processing, digital communications, computer vision, human activity modeling, and human computer interaction, might also benefit by the research. ICSI involves many female researchers; has a high school outreach program, and trains students, and other investigators.

Hislop<br/>University of Kentucky<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/><br/>The spectral and transport properties of random Schrodinger operators have been the object of intense study. Anderson localization, the occurrence of dense pure point spectrum almost surely, has been proved for many models at band-edges and at the bottom of the spectrum. Refined estimates give precise information about the decay of the eigenfucntions and the dynamical localization of the system. Conductivity properties of the system are described through the second-order current-current correlation function.<br/>Study of these correlation functions reveal information about Mott conductivity, the density of states, and eigenvalue statistics. There are many open questions about the regularity and bounds on these functions. A lower bound on the current-current correlation function implies delocalization, for example. Another new tool for the study of these systems is the use of random matrix theory. This promises to give insight into the density of states in the delocalized regime.<br/><br/>Random Schrodinger operators provide a model for the propagation of electrons in perfect crystalline structures that are corrupted by impurities randomly distributed in the medium. It is hoped that the study of these models reveals the mechanisms for finite conductivity at low temperatures and the integer quantum Hall effect. New advances allow one to investigate the transport properties of these models as expressed through correlation functions. These correlations functions describe physically measurable quantities such as the density of states and the Mott conductivity.

However, realizing the potential of MIMO systems is countered by the effects of fading, mobility, interference, and low-power requirements. The problem of interference is exacerbated by the proliferation of ad-hoc networks <br/>and the emergence of ultra-wideband communications.<br/><br/>Existing approaches to MIMO wireless transceiver design assume either perfect channel knowledge or no channel knowledge at the transmitter. The latter yields pessimistic designs, while the former is unrealistic and can result in substantial performance losses in cases of severe channel mismatch. Thus, the researchers are investigating the fundamental capacity and error performance limits of MIMO wireless <br/>systems for varying degrees degrees of PARTIAL channel knowledge. Correspondingly, they are developing channel-adaptive MIMO transceivers based on partial channel knowledge that minimize transmit-power and maximize data rates at a prescribed error probability margin. Hybrid schemes are being researched that incorporate both space-time block coding and space-time beam forming to effect interference avoidance and robustness to imperfect channel knowledge. The advanced algorithms under development will profoundly alter MIMO technology and directly impact the robustness and bandwidth efficiency of wireless multi-antenna communications.

The place of ceremonial centers in early settled life, especially as they interacted and transformed the local domestic communities and the broader landscape, is an important subject in archaeological inquiry. This project will address these issues at the highland Peruvian site of Chavin de Huantar, the presumed ceremonial center of the Early Horizon (900-200 BC). A full analysis of all remains, with special focus on paleoethnobotanical analyses of macroscopic and microscopic plant samples will be completed. Paleoethnobotany is able to address changing agricultural, collecting and food practices because it is one field where the three seemingly discrete areas of ecology, ritual, and agriculture intersect. <br/><br/>There are three parts to this project. The first section is the excavation of domestic households in the La Banda region, across the river from the site of Chavin. The La Banda sector is the first contemporaneous domestic community to be accessible at Chavin. Excavations, combined with direct absolute dating, will reliably situate these domestic constructions within the local chronology and determine the relationship of this sector with the monumental sector of Chavin. The second part of the project is a modern agroecological survey, which will be funded by other sources. The third component of the project is a paleoethnobotanical analysis conducted on excavated materials from the domestic and ceremonial areas of Chavin. The paleoethnobotanical research will include the analysis of macrobotanical remains, phytoliths and starch grains from soil samples as well as from use-surfaces of selected artifacts. This research is particularly crucial as the site is postulated to have served as a center for ritual induction through the use of sacred plants. Additionally, the spread of the Chavin cult has been important in the debates surrounding the extent of trade and exchange during these early civilizations, especially the place of plants in these exchanges. These research goals are particularly important at a site whose nature has long been inferred without substantial, testable data.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this study builds on its contribution to wider theoretical discussions of life inside and outside early ceremonial centers, especially for Chavin de Huantar, a site of central importance in the development of civilization in the pre-Hispanic Andes, as well as on Paleoethnobotanical methodology. The broader impacts of this project is seen in the major cultural exchange between Americans and Peruvians providing training opportunities for undergraduate students from several nations. Stanford and UC Berkeley undergraduate and Peruvian students will assist in excavations of the domestic structures in the La Banda region under my supervision and that of project field director, Dr. John Rick. Additionally, four Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program (URAP) students from UC Berkeley will be involved in post-excavation laboratory analysis, with specific emphasis on Latin American students. The results of this research will be widely distributed in both academic and public settings including presentations to Peruvian and American schools.

Using a technique of spatially resolved spectroscopy, this research team will obtain a unique data set that, when coupled with radiative<br/>transfer and spectral synthesis modeling, will accomplish the following measurement objectives: a)<br/>determine the spatial and temporal variation of Saturn's cloud opacity, and b) determine the spatial and temporal variation of Saturn's chemical composition. These measurements will enhance our understanding of Saturn's atmospheric processes, including its dynamics, chemical composition, and radiative transfer.<br/><br/>The medium- and high-resolution infrared spectrometers at the Infrared Telescope Facility 3.0 meter telescope will be used to acquire spectra of Saturn between 2.5-5.4 m, which is a wavelength region particularly sensitive to cloud opacity and scattering properties. Saturn's cold spots, which may control the radiative transfer through Saturn's atmosphere in a manner analogous to Jupiter's 5-m hot spots, will be studied as a function of latitude and slant path geometry. This will elucidate the detailed vertical structure of the atmosphere and the role of the cold, dark regions in controlling the thermal emission from the planet. The spatial and temporal variations of ammonia, phosphine, and ethane on Saturn will be examined as a means of understanding Saturn's atmospheric dynamics. Phosphine (PH3) is a disequilibrium species, thus any spatial variation in PH3 may be linked to variations in upwelling from the deep atmosphere, whereas variations in ammonia would be associated with spatial variations in cloud formation. Center-to-limb studies of ethane, a stratospheric molecule, will differ from those of ammonia, which is found in Saturn's troposphere. Ethane can be detected near 3 mm, and will provide an important constraint for understanding Saturn's atmospheric vertical structure. While Saturn's reflectivity variations as a function of latitude are more subtle than those of Jupiter, the dynamics driving the circulation of the two planets may be similar. Thus, a study of the latitudinal variation in Saturn's infrared spectrum is relevant to the understanding of the energy balance of Saturn's atmosphere. All data will be modeled using both center-to-limb analyses and spectral synthesis methods. With these two approaches, the goal is to develop a unified model of Saturn's atmospheric structure that places aerosol layers at the appropriate vertical levels, characterizes cloud and haze opacities and optical properties, derives mixing ratios for ammonia, phosphine, and ethane, and quantifies the temporal and spatial variations of the above quantities. This study will make unique contributions to our understanding of Saturn's atmosphere. By interpreting observations of Saturn's reflected and thermally emitted radiation using a self-consistent modeling approach, the team will develop a comprehensive description of the energy balance in Saturn's<br/>atmosphere. Prior studies will be improved by using an observational approach that can exploit the unique attributes of spatially-resolved spectroscopy. The observations will overlap the spectral coverage of Cassini's Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS), and will complement the high phase angle spacecraft data taken contemporaneously with the ground-based data. They will also probe deeper pressure levels than Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrograph (CIRS), and therefore will provide an essential component of molecular mixing ratio studies.<br/><br/>This work is interdisciplinary and promotes synergy between the analysis of reflected sunlight that has been conducted at New Mexico State University (NMSU) to date and the thermal infrared work in which the Co-Investigators are experts. This program will promote teaching and training through practical research by involving several NMSU students and giving them opportunities to participate in all aspects of the research. In addition, it will broaden the participation of women and ethnic minorities, both underrepresented demographics in science and engineering fields.<br/>***

Hutchinson, UC-Irvine<br/><br/>This small grant for exploratory research (SGER) is requested as a small extension to an existing field experiment project conducted on a full-scale building structure in the Los Angeles area. In the field project, the dynamic response of a number of nonstructural elements within the building of interest were measured during simulated seismic and other transient loading cases. Loading for these experiments was provided by mass eccentric and linear shakers mounted on the roof of the building. Of particular interest during the experiments was the in-place dynamic characterization of suspended piping systems. Limitations in the shaker systems prohibited larger than approximately 0.3g input motions into the structure. Subsequent to field testing, a number of suspended piping systems were removed from the building and collected for future characterization tests in the laboratory. To broaden the parameter space of suspended piping system dynamic response data, a small laboratory shake table testing program is proposed herein to capitalize on this available piping hardware, instrumentation from the previous field experiments, and all associated mounting hardware. In addition, a suitable diaphragm structure from previous nonstructural experiments conducted at UC Irvine is available for these experiments, with minimal modifications required.<br/><br/>The proposed laboratory program will allow the study of suspended piping systems at full-scale, and considering large amplitude seismic loading. Four aspects will be investigated, that could not be studied in the field, in a systematic fashion: (i) varying piping layouts (straight, 45_bends, and 90_bends), (ii) liquid filled (and not), (iii) differential (versus not) input motions and (iv) type of suspension system (hung, braced, and ductility enhanced). The later parameter investigation will involve the exploratory development of a simple ductility enhancement device, placed at the suspension/brace hanger, to incorporate additional seismic energy dissipation capacity. This is envisioned to result in decreased acceleration demands along the pipe and particularly at its joints, where large demands observed in the past have resulted in fracture at bends. The explored solution will be of a practical, cost-effective nature, such as a simple yielding steel<br/>member.

When observational resources are scarce and expensive, an adaptive approach to selecting which observations to make, based on the data assembled thus far, should be able to improve the accuracy, precision and efficiency of the work.    This research will develop a general framework for flexible, adaptive scientific exploration based on iterating an Observation-Inference-Design cycle, relying on Bayesian methods and called Bayesian Adaptive Exploration (BAE).  Developing BAE through a broad range of methodological research, and then applying BAE to several time-variable phenomena, will lead to numerous theoretical and algorithmic innovations in statistics, and to significantly improved answers in the study of extra-solar planets, binary star systems, minor planets in our solar system, and variable stars in nearby galaxies.  Since the required calculations are extremely demanding, several approaches will be explored, including extending existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo inference algorithms, developing bridge/path importance sampling algorithms and Gaussian process meta-models, and the use of sub-region-adaptive quadrature.<br/><br/>BAE is an adaptive generalization of the scientific method and will therefore be broadly applicable in many disciplines.  This project will create and widely disseminate public-domain software implementing the methods, with tutorial and instructional material.  At least one graduate student will receive extensive interdisciplinary training.

The objective of the MIRAGE-Mex campaign is to improve our understanding of the impacts of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area pollution plume, to study the gas phase reactivity in the urban-regional-global transition, analyze the physical and chemical evolution of aerosols and their radiative properties, and study gas-aerosol interactions. This project will contribute towards these goals by forecasting the evolution of the plume and to analyze the meteorological conditions during the experiment. The project will use MM5 (Fifth-Generation Mesoscale Model), CAMx, and FLEXPART models. Specific tasks will include: Analysis of plume dispersion from the Mexico City basin; investigation of residence times, mixing processes, slope flows and urban heat island flow to determine the initial conditions necessary for analyzing regional export and global transport; development of advanced methods for model evaluation for conditions of weak and variable wind flow, the development of improved inputs for the meteorological Land Surface Model. In addition, methods will be developed for source identification based on particle trajectories.<br/><br/>This project will provide educational opportunities for a graduate student and a post-doctoral researcher, and provide a central element for a field program aimed at a very important topic regarding the interactions between atmospheric composition, in particular under conditions influenced by megacity emissions, and climate.

(Sitting Bull). In this pilot project we locate Lakota historical, cultural and recreational areas. Lakota Land includes establishing a geodatabase, setting up an online interactive map, supporting the formation of a committee to handle sensitive sites, and investigating links of Native sites with geospatial features - such as water or mountains. <br/><br/>For the Lakota Land project we are: a) preserving sites from destruction; b) advancing the understanding of geospatial technology among the Native American public; c) fostering Native identity; d) providing a tool for tribal decision making; e) educating Native and non-native communities; f) providing a database for researchers of Native culture/history; g) offering alternatives to socio-economic problems and h) research geospatial patterns to identify additional sites. <br/><br/>This project has a broad impact. It already involves the community, tribal pre-college and undergraduate geoscience education. Volunteers and students interview community members and acquire GPS coordinates of Native American sites and map them. They also research the importance of the sites. This program helps reservation residents to enter and advance in geoscience careers. <br/><br/>This project has the intellectual merit of increasing the understanding of geoscience by tribal residents. We are developing unique procedures for documenting Lakota cultural sites: a working database and an interactive online map of sites approved for publication. This map is a tool to acquaint tribal and nontribal members with geospatial technology, Lakota values and culture.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Office of the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) at the National Science Foundation.

Based on key leverage points identified from the literature, EEES will focus its efforts on bringing expertise in gender studies and the research base on science and engineering education to a) academic preparation for engineering study for students at the middle school (grade 6) through collegiate sophomore levels, b) the out-of-class social environment, c) the in-class social environment, c) curricular content, d) curricular scope and sequence design, e) curriculum delivery and instructional style. A key part of our strategy is reaching those teachers and faculty who do not have an a priori interest in gender equity activities by suffusing attention to gender equity into other core areas of concern. We will do this by facilitating:<br/><br/>* Access to recognized Experts in gender studies in science and engineering for advice and to the education research infrastructure of the National Academies.<br/><br/>* Collaboration with national organizations (American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, Project Lead the Way, National Association of Partnerships for Equity) to provide an infrastructure of extension agents on gender equity. Focus has been placed on organizations with a) broad reach, b) a pre-existing emphasis on professional development for their members/affiliates, c) demonstrated capacity to influence activities in engineering and pre-engineering classrooms.<br/><br/>* Access to long-term technical assistance via web-based expert-mediated and peer-led synchronous and asynchronous discussions and access to archived resources.<br/><br/>* Development of a handbook on proposing and managing engineering education projects and conducting workshops on this topic at national and regional engineering meetings. The handbook will fuse attention to gender equity, engineering education, and project management into a seamless whole.<br/><br/>Our experts will translate research to practice by discussing emerging and established research findings and their implications for design principles with would-be extension agents within collaborating national organizations. The clients of the extension agents will be responsible for specific implementations of these principles in their local context. In addition to general principles we will highlight identified best practices at the pre-college and undergraduate levels.<br/><br/>Our evaluation plan will look at changes in attitudes and behaviors by classroom teachers and faculty as well as metrics of extent and impact of participation.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This effort extends and deepens the knowledge of best practices that are likely to enhancing the successful matriculation and graduation of women from baccalaureate engineering programs. It will contribute to a greater appreciation for the growing base of research on engineering education and the need for comprehensive approaches in achieving desired human resource development outcomes in engineering education.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This effort directly contributes to the enhancement of the human resource base of women in engineering disciplines and provides a model for extension to other populations that are underrepresented in engineering. The model offered will provide valuable guidance to non-engineering disciplines in developing similar structures. As a collaborative model linking academic and professional organizations, it will facilitate collaboration across a range of issues related to enhancing the quality of engineering education K-16.

The research builds on tools and understandings developed under a current NSF grant. Lattice locations of solutes affect many properties of materials. Locations of PAC probes, used as solute atoms, can be determined by measurement of quadrupole interactions. A feature of PAC measurements is that solutes are present at the thermodynamically dilute limit. Lattice locations have been observed to change dramatically over very narrow ranges of composition, even for line compounds in binary phase diagrams. Solutes have been observed to switch variously among substitutional sites of alloy constituents, empty-sublattice sites having interstitial character, and sites such as in grain boundaries. A thermodynamic model and set of heuristic rules were developed that explain these observations. In this grant PAC measurements are made for phases having other crystal structures in order to develop understanding of the systematics of site preference behavior. Some nuclear magnetic resonance measurements also are planned for measurements on additional solutes. Atom movement underlies all diffusion phenomena. A new method has been discovered to study atom movement in compounds. When a hyperfine probe atom jumps on a sublattice of noncubic sites for which the electric field gradient reorients in each jump, the jumps lead to decoherence or relaxation of the quadrupole interaction that can be fitted to obtain the jump frequency. Activation enthalpies for jump frequencies were determined for phases having the Cu3Au structure with precision as good as in tracer diffusion studies. In the same way as for lattice locations, jump frequencies have been found to be highly sensitive to small compositional changes. PAC studies are planned for other Cu3Au phases and for more complex crystal structures in which probe atoms jump between inequivalent sublattices. For some complex structures, it will be shown that one can discriminate between intra- and inter-sublattice jump frequencies of tracer atoms, something impossible to do using the tracer diffusion method. NONTECHNICAL: These investigations will increase understanding of two fundamental aspects of solids. Lattice locations of dilute solutes more clearly exhibit strong composition and temperature dependences predicted by the thermodynamics of solutions and increase our understanding of site preference behavior. Jump-frequency measurements that discriminate among different kinds of jumps provide information unattainable by other methods and may also give insight into detailed diffusion mechanisms. The project involves participation and training of two graduate students and several undergraduates over a four-year period, using a diverse group of students. Results will be disseminated broadly in publications and presentations. Contact between this research and a broader audience will be made through seminars at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

The investigators plan to construct individual phantoms of AAAs from CT scans of patients, and use the phantoms to analyze and characterize the flow patterns through the phantoms under both steady and pulsatile conditions. In the next phase of the project, arterial endothelial cells will be seeded on to the interior wall of the phantoms and allowed to multiply. Then the phantoms are tested under the specific flow and stress tests as determined earlier in the project. Finally, the cells are tested for certain selected markers which affect the arterial wall elasticity and the possibility of rupture. The project offers a balanced integration of engineering techniques, molecular biology and medicine.

Wilkens, Principal Investigator<br/><br/>The electrosense is a specialized sensory modality of ancient fish and is best known in sharks that are able to detect the electrical fields of potential prey at close range and to use electromagnetic fields for navigation. Whereas these are macroscopic functions of the electrosense, the electrosensory system in the freshwater paddlefish has recently been shown to detect the weak electric fields of tiny plankton, the primary food source for the fish. The electroreceptors of this novel sensory system are present on an elongated rostrum, one-third the length of the fish, which constitutes an electrosensory organ the equivalent of an antenna. The exquisite sensitivity of this organ and its behavioral role in targeting planktonic prey makes it a useful model preparation in which to investigate the sensory processing of spatial features in the environment. Importantly, the brain contains a large, easily distinguishable region that is well suited for exploring the neural processing that underlies the feeding behavior. Dr. Wilkens' objective in this research proposal is to elucidate the neural circuitry and algorithms that enable the paddlefish to selectively target single plankton adrift in the turbid water column. <br/>Dr. Wilkens will study the electric signaling properties of sensory fibers coming from the receptors on the rostrum and the properties of neurons that the fibers contact in the hindbrain region, the dorsal octavolateralis nucleus (DON), which first processes the electrosensory information. Initial experiments will investigate the organization of sensory input into the DON. In sensory systems from other animals there is typically a topographic representation of peripheral receptive fields mapped out onto their target cells in the brain, such that adjacent brain cells correspond to nearby receptive fields. Early physiological recordings, however, have found no evidence for such topography in the paddlefish brain. To further investigate this unusual feature, Dr. Wilkens will use histological staining techniques that trace the nerve projections of the sensory fibers into the brain. This will provide direct neuroanatomical evidence for the organization of electrosensory processing in the brain.<br/>If it is confirmed that there is no topographical organization, other mechanisms for extracting spatial features must exist. Previous records of neural impulse activity from nerve cells in the DON show that their firing rates reflect the first derivative of an electrosensory stimulus waveform. Thus, brain cells respond preferentially to dynamical features of the stimulus signal, rather than to its magnitude. With the possibility that anatomical data will confirm the absence of spatial topography in the DON, Dr. Wilkens has developed a computer simulation model of a derivative filter whereby the information about the distance and velocity of an environmental signal could be encoded in the response neurons of the DON. The model will be tested by presenting electrical stimuli that move over the receptive fields in the rostrum, thus simulating the planktonic electric fields encountered by the fish during normal swimming. Recordings from these cells will be followed by the injection of nerve stains to trace their projections into higher midbrain regions. It is hypothesized that topographic representation will be established in the terminal projections of DON cells in the midbrain. <br/>Dr. Wilkens' descriptions of the electrosense in paddlefish has had broad implications for fisheries management of this threatened species, providing an explanation for why fish avoid metal structures (dams) in the rivers in addition to becoming an important model system for studying brain function. Dr. Wilkens will actively recruit underrepresented students from the St. Louis urban region to participate in this project.

In the search for genes underlying human complex diseases, <br/>haplotype-based association analysis has been recognized as a tool with <br/>high resolution and, more importantly, potentially great power for <br/>identifying modest etiological effects of genes. However, in practice, <br/>its efficacy has not been as successful as expected in theory; one primary <br/>cause is that such analysis requires a large number of parameters in order <br/>to capture the abundant haplotype varieties. While high degrees of freedom <br/>can hinder the power of identifying modest genetic effects on complex <br/>diseases, the need to incorporate covariates of other risk factors further <br/>worsens the degrees-of-freedom problem in mapping genes for complex <br/>diseases. To tackle this issue, the proposed work constructs an efficient <br/>and powerful model-based framework for association analysis at haplotype <br/>level. The central focus of the methods development is on the efficient <br/>use of haplotype information in a model-based framework, and different <br/>strategies of reducing haplotype complexity are considered at different <br/>research stages to optimize efficiency. For screening-stage analyses, the <br/>PI constructs approaches based on haplotype similarity of pair-wise <br/>comparison in a regression platform to detect chromosomal regions that are <br/>likely to harbor disease genes. For refinement-stage analyses, the PI <br/>develops evolutionary-based methods of haplotype grouping to identify <br/>specific disease-associated haplotypes, and integrate new <br/>dimension-reduction techniques into existing regression methods.<br/><br/>The proposed work aims not only to provide novel association tools in <br/>complex gene mapping, but also develop a routine method for case-control <br/>studies and offer a methodological foundation for future advancement. With <br/>the availability of a better statistical tool, scientists can advance <br/>their understanding of complex diseases, and design better diagnostic and <br/>therapeutic strategies that improve human health.

The visit will help develop a collaborative plan for developing an integrated hydrologic-economic model for the Dong Nai River Basin (DNRB). It is the largest national river basin and also the economic center of southern Vietnam. The challenges facing water management in the DNRB include rapid industrial development and urban growth, which is placing growing pressure on urban-industrial water demands and hydropower production. At the same time, these uses directly compete with the agriculture sector. The problems are compounded by an increasing amount of industrial effluents and domestic wastewater, which are discharged directly into the water bodies without prior treatment. Despite several large investments in multipurpose reservoirs, the full irrigation potential of the area has yet to be achieved, due to lack of financial resources, increasing downstream demands, growing salinity problems, poor management of irrigation systems, and lack of coordination among water resources projects in the region. In order to help support coordination of water management in the DNRB, a better understanding of water supply, demand, quality, and its value in various uses is needed. Moreover, understanding the role of alternative policy instruments in alleviating likely future water shortages and continuing deterioration of water quality in the basin will help allocate scarce resources more appropriately across irrigation, hydropower development, and urban water supply demands. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has developed an integrated economic-hydrologic model for the DNRB. During this visit the collaborators will assemble a team responsible for developing and applying the model and plan for further work such as data collection, surveys, and setting scenarios for analysis, etc. The long-term goals of the project are to (1) improve the IFPRI_DNRB model as a decision-support tool by incorporating groundwater and water quality models; and (2) to use the model as a tool for achieving consensus among those with interests in the basin's water resources.

The developed numerical tool will determine the optimal process geometry, temperature and speed that satisfy specified design criteria for a given two-dimensional forming process. An optimization algorithm based on an adaptive arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element formulation for modeling large deformation thermo-elasto-viscoplastic contact problems will be used. The algorithm will be implemented in the context of an existing advanced computational framework that has tools for mesh generation, adaptivity, and parallel computing. Experiments involving the extrusion process will also be performed to validate the algorithms developed. Experimental dies will be manufactured according to the optimal die shapes predicted in this work and tested at the predicted optimal die speeds. A model press, which can extrude plasticine material marked with a grid, will be used in these experiments to observe the material flow behavior.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the design of bulk forming processes and new developments in optimization methods for handling complex non-linear problems. The primary goal of this work is to determine optimal process geometry, thermal conditions, and process speed in bulk forming processes that will satisfy typically prescribed design criteria. These design criteria may include generating a uniform flow of the material, generating a specified material property distribution in the formed product, minimizing the production time, or minimizing the energy required for the process. Determining the process parameters to achieve these objectives will help to reduce the cost and improve the quality of the final product in processes such as extrusion and forging. The proposed work will also contribute to the computational tools and methodologies available for nonlinear optimization problems.

Energy and communications are key technologies facing humankind today. The results of this project could have a major impact on both technologies. This project, with its focus on the thermal energy transport issues and will address one of the key issues facing molecular electronics. Molecular electronics have the potential to increase efficiency of the energy transport and production processes, and resolving the thermal barrier problem will only serve to hasten their use. The first objective is to experimentally and computationally develop the scientific foundation for understanding thermal energy transport across the barrier of metal-molecule and metal-molecule-semiconductor interfaces, the foundation elements for molecular scale electronic devices. Experiments will be conducted to measure the thermal conduction properties across the material interfaces using lasers pulses transient energy transport methods. On the computational aspect of the research, molecular dynamics simulations will be performed. This technique models the energy transport at the scale of the molecules and even sub-molecule scale. The combination of experiments and computations will provide fundamental knowledge and understanding on how energy moves across these molecular and sub-molecular, nano-structured material systems. The technical phase of the project will also include interactions with Professor Shigeo Maruyama and his students at the University of Tokyo as well as with Dr. Larry Niagara, Distinguished Member of the Technical Staff and Manager of the PanEnergy group at Motorola Laboratories. The second objective is to develop a multi-university education program in micro/nano thermo physics. The education program will bring together students and faculty from MSU and UCB for the first collaborative, distance-taught course. Through this course and through the collaboration with Professor Maruyama and his students, we will be able to bridge and launch new global cooperation and networking with tomorrow's leaders of our profession.

Jewett to work with Dr. Jens Nielsen at Technical University of Denmark's Center for Microbial Biotechnology (CMB) in Lyngby, Denmark.<br/><br/>Genetically engineering cells for production of valuable protein therapeutics and secondary metabolites is widely exploited in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. However, achieving desired phenotypes that are, in general, not the Darwinian optimum, presents a formidable challenge given the complex nature of the catalytic inventory, metabolic pathways, signaling circuits, and regulatory networks of microorganisms. To rationally design cell factories, we must use system-level methods to gain an understanding of the physiological information necessary to rewire cellular control element. The objective of this project is to identify key components of glucose repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using systems biology for design of glucose de-repressed strains. Such strains are industrially attractive for improving baker's yeast production from molasses, bioethanol production from sugar mixtures, and heterologous protein production. To achieve this goal, the PI and host will combine genome-scale metabolic models with DNA array and metabolite profiling data of several glucose repression mutants. Detailed characterization of these mutants by model guided analysis of global cellular function will allow mapping of all pleotrophic effects, identification of co-regulated metabolic patterns, and subsequent engineering of desired strains. In addition to accomplishing this main objective, ther study has several expected deliverables. First, novel algorithms for integration of data from both the transcriptome and the metabolome will be developed. Second, new analytical methods for metabolite profiling based on direct infusion mass spectrometry will be designed. Third, the role of regulatory elements involved in glucose sensing and repression will be clarified.<br/><br/>This study will have a broad impact on the field of systems biology and yeast genetics/physiology. Particularly, the novel algorithms will find wide use in metabolic engineering and directly enhance our capability to design made to order organisms. In addition, the development of glucose de-repressed strains of S. cerevisiae will increase their utility as industrial production hosts. Furthermore, since glucose repression in yeast serves as a model for nutrient sensing in eukaryotic cells, the development of efficient algorithms for this system may be applied to mapping of signal transduction pathways in higher eukaryotes - including humans. Progress in this research area will directly enhance and complement many technologies in the scientific community while generating a valuable international partnership. The CMB has a strong international position in metabolic engineering, fermentation, physiology, functional genomics, and systems biology of eukaryotic microorganisms.

The copolymer films are prepared by a unique surface-catalyzed polymer film growth that enables tunable film thicknesses from ~20 to 1000 nm, highly controlled compositions, and selective growth on gold surfaces. Recent work from the PI's laboratory has shown that exposure of gold surfaces to dilute solutions of diazomethane (DM) and ethyl diazoacetate (EDA) at low temperature results in a controlled, catalyzed growth of a novel copolymer film containing predominately linear polymethylene (PM) with random ethyl ester side groups. The ester side groups can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids that become deprotonated or ionized upon increases in pH to function as a pHresponsive gate. Such responsive polymer films have broad applications in chemical and biological sensors, dynamic surfaces, and smart membranes. The proposed plan provides new approaches to molecularly tailor film and surface composition to affect the onset, magnitude, and rate of the pHinduced response. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>The proposed project builds from these successful initial results to develop (1) a new pH-responsive copolymer film that exhibits a different turn-on value, and (2) pH-sensitive flip-flop groups that can be attached to polymer surfaces or onto self-assembling thiol adsorbates to yield interfaces that exhibit large pH-induced changes in surface energy. The work described herein will advance fundamental knowledge in the area of smart films and interfaces by examining the (i) the role of side chain composition and concentration on the onset, magnitude, and rate of the pH-induced response in polymer barrier properties, (ii) the effect of hydrophobic trifluoromethyl groups on the switchable properties of pH-responsive surface groups, (iii) the ability to actively control the response of these films and interfaces by use of applied potential to alter the local pH. Within these aims, the proposed work will determine the effect of film thickness and uniformity on the rate and mechanism of aqueous permeation and direct the growth of the films to yield patterned features that amplify the magnitude of pH- or potential-driven transformations in surface properties. Combined, these aims will identify film compositions that magnify film response in both surface and barrier properties and will develop new approaches to actively control film properties.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity<br/><br/>The project will integrate research and education by providing opportunities for undergraduates, especially minority students, to gain research experience in smart films/interfaces and by developing new learning materials in five different courses from the freshman level to the graduate level. The project comprises aspects of kinetics, mass transport, and molecular design that will be incorporated into lectures as case studies, examples, and homework problems to hone the molecular intuition of chemical engineering and interdisciplinary students. In addition to a graduate student, the project will support three undergraduate students over three summers by providing research assistantships. Through their work, the undergraduate students will implement concepts learned in the classroom and discover molecular-level approaches to the design of smart materials. Through this research, the students will develop an enhanced molecular intuition and will gain a solid understanding of the scientific process.

Ann M. Fraser (Kalamazoo College) and John E. Hofferberth (Kenyon College). <br/>How new species arise is an enduring question in biology. The study of host selection behavior in herbivorous insects has provided important insights by demonstrating that shifts in host preference can evolve rapidly and that local adaptation to novel hosts can initiate genetic divergence and thus play an important role in the early stages of the speciation process. Underlying host specificity and host shifts are complex chemosensory mechanisms that mediate behavioral responses to host stimuli. Elucidating these mechanisms and their role in ecological specialization and reproductive isolation, therefore, is important to our understanding of the speciation process. Building on studies of herbivorous insects and their association with plants, this project seeks to understand how obligate association with ants may enhance diversification in the butterfly family Lycaenidae. Using the Australian butterfly genus Jalmenus and their attendant Iridomyrmex ants as a model, this collaborative research project aims to elucidate the olfactory cues used by butterflies to locate and identify appropriate ant partners, and to characterize the degree to which butterfly populations exhibit local adaptation with respect to host ant selection. To elucidate the olfactory cues, butterfly antennae will be screened for electrophysiological responses to volatile components emitted by ants. Electrophysiologically-active compounds will be chemically synthesized to verify identifications and then tested for behavioral activity using attraction and egg-laying bioassays. Electrophysiological and behavioral studies will be conducted in Fraser's laboratory at Kalamazoo College and in Australia. Chemical syntheses and identifications will be carried out in Hofferberth's laboratory at Kenyon College. The results of this research will broaden our understanding of how host recognition mechanisms and host selection behavior influence the speciation process in taxa that have close associations with other species. This project will provide undergraduate students with research opportunities that integrate biological and chemical approaches to address broad evolutionary questions, and teach skills that are useful for basic and applied research. This project will also provide the PIs with an opportunity to engage in multidisciplinary research and to establish collaborations with international researchers in Australia.

The advent of new tools and associated technologies in modern genetics/genomics has provided an exciting opportunity to integrate genetic findings and detection of minute DNA molecules to all aspects of plant genetics on a high-throughput scale. This facility will form a powerful investigative high-throughput research tool, and enhance the capability of NDSU researchers to understand the molecular genetic basis of these problems and address them in a timely manner.<br/>Development of the NDSU high-throughput genetic analysis facility will allow researchers to screen large reverse genetic collections for identification and characterization of mutations in genes, develop high-resolution maps of chromosomes and or chromosomal regions for physical mapping and gene cloning, conduct genetic testing and selection in large populations for characterization of gene action in different genetic backgrounds and environmental stresses, apply association mapping techniques to gene discovery, analyze plant pathogens in the environment or as they interact with their hosts, and detect bio-contaminants in food samples and their impact on human health and nutrition. NDSU researchers are committed to incorporating the methodologies involved and data generated into the training and education of students at all levels, providing them with access to state-of-the-art science and skills needed to successfully compete in the job market. <br/>The equipment will impact a very large group of projects from more than seven departments across the NDSU campus alone. Through numerous collaborations this equipment can potentially impact a large number of projects in smaller regional universities and colleges as well. NDSU faculty and extension services help train and educate a large group of traditional and non-traditional students including high school students and teachers, undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, tribal college students, crop consultants, growers, and members of various crop improvement associations.

The Tenet project's guiding architectural principle asserts that multi-node data fusion functionality and complex application logic should be implemented only on the masters, since the cost and complexity of implementing this in motes outweighs the performance benefits of doing so.<br/><br/>Tenet thus simplifies and standardizes the design and construction of the most difficult-to-handle software on a sensor network. It restricts mote communication to trees rooted at masters. Tree communication is well understood, leads to more predictable communication patterns and improves the manageability of the mote tier. Direct inter-mote communication would destroy much of this predictability and manageability.<br/><br/>The project is designing and prototyping the Tenet stack. This stack embodies the Tenet architectural principle and can be reused by several applications. The development of such a stack for large-scale sensor networks will greatly accelerate the development of a variety of applications ranging from habitat monitoring to structural monitoring. Without a Tenet-like architecture, sensor network deployments will never truly impact the world.
0515010	Collaborative research: a new theoretical and algorithmic framework for RTL datapath verification using polynomial algebra over finite rings	CCF	NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT	08/01/2005	07/21/2005	Florian Enescu	GA	Georgia State University Research Foundation, Inc.

As digital designs proceed through various synthesis and optimization stages, it is required to verify the functional equivalence of different design implementations. However, the growing complexity of digital systems is limiting the scope and applications of contemporary verification tools. This has particularly affected efficient verification of polynomial signal processing and multimedia applications where arithmetic datapath computations are implemented at register-transfer-level (RTL). For such designs, the verification problem can be modeled as that of proving polynomial equivalence over finite integer rings of the form Z_{2^k}, where k is the size of the datapath operands. In this project properties of these integer rings are being thoroughly investigated, and used to investigate algorithms for verification of digital circuits modeled at the register-transfer-level.<br/><br/>In this collaborative research, the PIs will: (1) study and derive new mathematical techniques to verify equivalence of multi-variate polynomials over finite rings of the form Z_{2^k}; (2) derive algorithmic procedures to prove polynomial equivalence in Z_{2^k}, within a CAD-based RTL verification framework; and (3) explore the above concepts in the context of efficient RTL synthesis of polynomial datapaths. The novelty of the problem lies in its mathematical challenge and in its engineering applications to RTL datapath verification. Successful completion of this project would broadly impact RTL datapath verification technology and enhance the understanding of some of the unresolved problems in classical mathematics.

Admin.	Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	CSE	2860	9218, HPCC	$0.00	Many optimization problems are NP-hard, and computing approximate solutions is an attractive way <br/>to cope with NP-hardness. The effort to understand the approximation properties of NP problems has <br/>occupied the center stage of theoretical computer science in the past decade. Despite many successes in this field, the status of some of the basic problems ---- metric tsp, vertex cover, graph coloring, sparsest cut etc.---is still open. The project consists of designing new approaches for computing approximate solutions to these problems. Any results for these central problems should generalize to many other problems.<br/>The tools used involve sophisticated geometric arguments, and lift and project technique from polyhedral combinatorics. Another goal is to develop a comprehensive framework for designing approximation algorithms without relying on semidefinite programming (SDP). Many recent approximation algorithms<br/>use SDP, which is not particularly efficient in practice. The goal in this project is to replace SDP with simpler algorithms based upon eigenvalue computations. Another aspect of the project is to prove lowerbounds to complement any new algorithms, or to rule out the existence of some of the above algorithms. The lowerbounds attempted would be both for all polynomial-time algorithms ---this would <br/>use PCPs---and for specific algorithms arising from lift and project methods. (The latter consists of <br/>viewing lift and project methods as a weak computational model.) <br/><br/>Broader impact of this project include dissemination efforts such as new innovative courses in graduate and <br/>undergraduate education, new text book, and survey articles on current research.

The methodology used to characterize stress-induced permeability anisotropy is to conduct both conventional extension and hybrid compression tests at the same pressure and temperature conditions. Since their loading paths coincide, the comparison of permeability values from the two types of tests provides quantitative estimates of the development of permeability anisotropy as function of effective mean and differential stresses. Specific tasks include: 1) to conduct conventional triaxial extension tests on both Indiana and Solnhofen limestones; 2) to conduct hybrid triaxial compression tests on both Indiana and Solnhofen limestones; 3) to conduct microstructural observation on the deformed samples. The focus of this study is to investigate the inelastic behavior and the evolution of permeability anisotropy upon failure in porous limestones at elevated temperature. The goal is to establish dynamic links between the evolution of permeability and the micromechanisms of failure, which is essential in understanding many seismogenic, sedimentary and metamorphic processes. <br/>Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity<br/>The proposed study will generate experimental data on how stress affects transport properties (porosity and permeability) in crustal rocks. The data will be of interest to scientists in many disciplines. Among other things, the proposed study will provide data that are useful for understanding fault mechanics, improving resource recovery, and predicting reservoir stability. Through websites, presentations, discussions and hands-on experiments, the PI will involve graduate students, undergraduate students (through WHOI summer student fellowship program), minority students and local high school students in the proposed study. Through these education and outreach activities, the proposed research will serve as a platform for cultivating and training researchers of the future.

The focus of this project is the efficient asymmetric synthesis of four complex triterpenes - salvadiol, salvadiones A and B, and peradione - in which several rings and virtually all of the asymmetric centers are created in biomimetic fashion from a common intermediate. <br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. George Majetich of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Georgia. A dominant goal in synthetic organic chemistry is the design of efficient and stereoselective synthetic strategies. One way of devising the most efficient synthetic route possible for a given compound is to recognize when two or more transformations can be achieved at the same time under the same reaction conditions, without isolation of the intermediate products. Indeed, the greater number of sequential transformations that can occur, the fewer the steps needed to achieve a given total synthesis and the more efficient the synthesis. This is the driving force and intellectual merit of cascade-based processes in organic synthesis. The synthesis of the four complex triterpenes by Professor Majetich and his students will enhance our knowledge of cascade reactions and further the development of new and efficient ways to prepare biologically interesting compounds. These factors are of tremendous importance for the practice of organic synthesis both for academic research and for industrial applications.

Grossmann <br/>Institution: Carnegie Mellon University<br/>Proposal Number: 0521769<br/>Title: Advanced Computational Models for Multistage Stochastic Optimization of Process Systems with Renewable Resources<br/><br/>Handling uncertainties in the design of process systems under multiperiod operation is becoming an increasingly important issue, particularly when dealing with systems such as bioprocesses where there are significant uncertainties in the availability and quality of the feedstocks and in the yields of the process units. A major objective of this project is to develop novel computational models for the stochastic optimization of process systems that involve exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. Examples of the former include demands or feed compositions, whereas examples of the latter include yields or other process parameters. The specific goal of the research is to develop novel models and effective solution methods for multistage stochastic optimization where the structure of scenario trees are functions of design decisions given endogenous uncertainties. To overcome the computationally challenging computations the PI intends to investigate a novel disjunctive programming formulation that expresses in closed form the dependency of the scenario tree with the design decisions. Based on that model, he intends to investigate a computational procedure based on a Lagrangean branch and cut method for solving linear stochastic problems. The method will rely on the use of grid computing using master-worker algorithms to exploit the subproblems that can be solved independently as part of the decomposition. The extension of this computational method to bilinear models will also be investigated.<br/><br/>This computational technique will be applied to two problems. The first one deals with the design of biorefineries (biomass conversion systems) in which there are uncertainties in the availability and quality of food residues (raw materials) and in the yields of conversion in the various processes that are involved. The second application deals with the synthesis of integrated process water systems in which there are uncertainties in the concentration of contaminants and in the recoveries of treatment units. The first application will be modeled as a linear stochastic programming problem, while the second one is a nonlinear stochastic problem that involves bilinearities.<br/><br/>Broader impact:<br/><br/>This research has the potential not only of expanding the scope and significance of stochastic optimization, but also for greatly improving the design of bioprocesses and process water systems. The research results and computational tools will be made available through the internet. The PI also intends to develop two design case studies that will be disseminated to process design instructors through CACHE. He believes that these case studies will have significant impact in undergraduate education as they will expose the students to biorefineries, process water systems and techniques for handling uncertainties. Finally, in order to promote interest in high schools in applied mathematics and processes based on renewable resources, he plans to perform outreach activities through the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education at Carnegie Mellon where students can be exposed to simplified versions of the case studies.

The template matching, hybridization reaction between DNA oligonucleotides is important in biotechnology and medicine (DNA microarrays),and nanotechnology (DNA directed self-assembly of nanostructures).The project should lead to a better understanding of how information can be encoded into an ensemble of hybridizing DNA oligonucleotides, and to better models and<br/>ways of characterizing large ensembles.<br/><br/>Simple protocols can be used to manipulate the contents of the memory to achieve information processing. In the statistical DNA memory, an ensemble of DNA molecules are trained with test tube protocols to reproduce particular input/output mappings, similar to artificial neural networks. Rather than a one to one mapping, information is encoded probabilistically into the DNA sequences and their hybridization interactions. These two architectures will be experimentally tested and modeled computationally and physically, and finally simulated to better understand how information is stored and manipulated through DNA template-matching hybridization reactions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>Graduate students will participate in the project, and thus, will be trained in the interdisciplinary knowledge and methods required of computational research using biological systems. They will be mentored to produce research publications, attend professional conferences and write graduate theses. <br/><br/>Curricular modules associated with the research will be developed for incorporation into both biological and computer curricula. These modules will provide instruction and demonstrations in the topic that show the interplay between the disciplines, as well as experimental, theoretical, and simulation methods. <br/><br/>The goal is to produce students that are better prepared for careers and challenges in the emerging synthesis of biology and computation.

Gas exchange takes place through a stomatal complex, which consists of a pair of guard cells that operate as a turgor-driven valve. Isolation of Arabidopsis mutants with elevated stomatal density and stomatal clustering reveals that stomatal patterning is under genetic regulation. This research project focuses on the cell-cell signaling mechanism regulating stomatal patterning and differentiation. A complete loss of three ERECTA-family receptor-like kinases (RLKs) leads to the generation of high-density stomatal clusters. Further analysis of different erecta-family mutant combinations shows that the three RLKs possess overlapping but distinct functions in two critical steps of stomatal differentiation: (1) the initial decision of protodermal cells to enter proliferative division or asymmetric division to generate stomatal complexes; and (2) the decision to maintain stomatal stem cell activity and prevent terminal differentiation of guard cells. Genetic interactions with a known stomatal patterning mutant, too many mouth (tmm), reveals stoichiometric epistasis and combination-specific neomorphism. These findings suggest that negative regulation of ERECTA-family RLKs by TMM receptor-like protein, is critical for proper stomatal differentiation. The specific aims are:<br/><br/>1) to determine the roles of three ERECTA-family receptor kinases during epidermal differentiation.<br/>2) to investigate interactions of three receptor kinases with known players of stomatal differentiation.<br/>3) to identify novel regulators of stomatal patterning and differentiation by taking advantage of a sensitized mutant background.<br/><br/>The proposed research may lead to important agricultural applications, since the ability to manipulate stomatal distribution and patterning may influence photosynthetic efficiency and hence the biomass production of crop plants. A postdoctoral associate, a graduate student and undergraduates, many of whom are women and of diverse ethnic backgrounds, will have excellent opportunities to obtain broad training in plant biology and molecular genetics.
0518404	Grounding the State: An Institutional Ethnography of Agrarian Reform in Brazil	BCS	GEOGRAPHY AND SPATIAL SCIENCES	08/01/2005	05/10/2007	Wendy Wolford	NC	University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill	Continuing grant	Thomas J.

It is widely argued that the country's extreme inequality in land ownership is constitutive of broader social and economic problems, such as uneven development, poverty, malnutrition, and violence.  New social actors such as the Movement of Rural Landless Workers (the MST) and the rural trade unions have mobilized hundreds of thousands of unemployed rural workers and landless farmers, organizing them to occupy unproductive properties and pressuring the government for their expropriation.  Between 1995 and 2001, the Brazilian government expropriated over 18 million hectares of land and settled approximately two million people.  This research project is an institutional ethnography of one of the most important government agencies involved in agrarian reform in Brazil, the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA).  In overseeing the juridical, technical and administrative aspects of agrarian reform, INCRA employees occupy an unusual position, working with both the needs of social movements and the state to re-distribute land and foster sustainable development on the new land reform settlements.  This research project employs a combination of methods at multiple scales (the national, the state, the community, and the household) including: observation, semi-structured interviews, participatory mapping, and media analysis.  Working in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, and in the northeastern state of Pernambuco, this research contributes to the dynamic field of political ecology by focusing its ethnographic lens on the state, analyzing the way in which historical patterns of land ownership and management shape the production of government discourse, policies, and practice.  In focusing on the state, this study also contributes to the growing literature on governmentality and neo-liberalism, making a theoretical contribution by grounding the state in the relationship between people and place.  Finally, this project contributes to the new literature on political economies of agrarian development that situates contemporary rural transformations within broader historical trajectories.<br/><br/>The empirical information gathered through this research will help to inform agrarian reform policy and practice in Brazil.  Considerable research has already been conducted on certain aspects of agrarian reform, particularly the role played by social movements, but INCRA itself remains a largely invisible actor -- seen without being understood.  By working with INCRA employees, land reform settlers, and the social movements to illuminate the complicated relationship between policy, process, and outcome, this research will provide a more complete picture of the state's role in promoting agrarian reform than previously possible.  This is particularly important at this time given the current Brazilian president's commitment to social change through land distribution.  The research will also provide important qualitative data on the quality of everyday life in the settlements.<br/>

Previous approaches have relied either on<br/>simple descriptions of those processes occurring near boundaries, such as<br/>linearized disturbances to uniform states, or on a range of ad hoc<br/>techniques that attempt to mitigate spurious artifacts of domain truncation.<br/>The present work is based on the concept of a super-grid-scale model that is<br/>in many ways analogous to sub-grid-scale models that are used in Large Eddy<br/>Simulations of turbulent flows. The formulation explicitly recognizes that<br/>in general systems (especially inhomogeneous and nonlinear PDE), domain<br/>truncation, like filtering, is a modeling problem--the result is ``missing<br/>information'' that cannot be recovered from first principles. Many existing<br/>techniques (especially damping layers) implicitly supply such a model, but<br/>our hypothesis, backed by preliminary calculations in compressible flow and<br/>acoustic applications, is that better models can be developed by exploiting<br/>a strong analogy with sub-grid-scale modeling techniques. The analogy is<br/>based on the dual roles that filtering and windowing play in real and<br/>Fourier space. The proposal details a rationally sequenced research program<br/>that includes examination of several different super-grid models (based on<br/>analogies to existing sub-grid models), detailed computations and comparison<br/>with previous methods in the areas of incompressible and compressible flow,<br/>acoustics, and electromagnetic, and detailed analysis of stability and<br/>convergence of the models and discretized systems.<br/><br/>It is often said that simulation is becoming the 'third leg' of science,<br/>taking an important place beside theory and experiment. In engineering,<br/>simulation is an essential tool that enables design and optimization based<br/>on first-principles rather than empirical correlations. However,<br/>computation is only useful when the underlying system is correctly modeled.<br/>Indeed, many relevant systems in fluid dynamics, acoustics, and<br/>electromagnetic waves cannot be reliably simulated with existing techniques.<br/>Techniques for artificial domain truncation, in particular, are a pacing<br/>item in many applications in these and related fields. Artificial domain<br/>truncation (or artificial boundary conditions) refers to situations where<br/>one wishes to simulate only a portion of a larger system in order to reduce<br/>computational effort. The present research will provide a new generation of<br/>such techniques that are based on a rigorous and well-validated modeling<br/>framework called the super-grid-scale model. Successful outcome of the<br/>proposed research has potential for far-ranging impact scientific and<br/>engineering design-oriented simulations.

The envisioned data-code-computing resources environment will provide a one-stop online portal for researchers, educators, and practitioners interested in the study of biomedical, social and behavioral science, physics, and other networks.<br/><br/>The NWB will support network science research across scientific boundaries. Users of the NWB will have online access to major network datasets or can upload their own networks. They will be able to perform network analysis with the most effective algorithms available. In addition, they will be able to generate, run, and validate network models to advance their understanding of the structure and dynamics of particular networks. NWB will provide advanced visualization tools to interactively explore and understand specific networks, as well as their interaction with other types of networks. <br/><br/>A major computer science challenge is the development of an algorithm integration framework that supports the easy integration and dissemination of existing and new algorithms and can deal with the multitude of network data formats in existence today. Another challenge is the design and implementation of an easy to use menu-based, online portal interface for interactive algorithm selection, data manipulation, user and session management. The NWB will be evaluated in diverse research projects and educational settings in biology, social and behavioral science, and physics research. It will be well documented and available as open source for easy duplication and usage at other sites. An annual summer school and a series of workshops and tutorials are planned to introduce the tool to diverse research communities. <br/><br/>The NWB will provide members of the scientific research community at large (biologists, physicists, computer scientists, social and behavioral scientists, engineers, etc.) with the means to carry out network analysis, modeling, and visualization projects in their own fields. This will result in a direct transfer of knowledge and results from the fields of specialist network research to a wider scientific community. Researchers will have access to validated algorithms that in the past have been obtained through time-consuming personal developments of ad hoc computer programs. The NWB is expected to enhance and encourage the empirical analysis and model validation of networks, generating an eventual acceleration in the development of network science research. Online instructional material will support the use of the NWB in educational settings. <br/><br/>The NWB will provide a unique tool for network science researchers in many disciplines. In effect, NWB can deploy the knowledge accumulated in network theory and practice across sciences with just one web click to any interested researcher, practitioner, or student. The NWB shared resources environment will speed up and ease network science applications and education in biology, social and behavioral science, and large infrastructure analysis, thereby accelerating the rate of scientific discovery.

One characteristic that appears to be influenced by both types of selection is the sword in green swordtails. The sword is a colorful extension at the bottom of the tail fin, and only male swordtails have swords. Female swordtails prefer males with long swords; one reason for this preference is that their ancestor preferred swords, even before males expressed swords. Thus, females have a pre-established bias favoring swords. The sword also affects competition for mates; males with long swords more often win contests for females. Yet, long swords also appear to be disadvantageous to males; in natural populations in which there are fish predators, males have shorter swords than in populations without these predators, suggesting that long swords may increase a male's risk of predation. If swords are costly to males because they make males more conspicuous to predators, females that associate with males with long swords may be more vulnerable to predation than females who associate with males with short swords. It does appears that the presence of a predator can influence a female's interest in a male with a long sword; when females see a predator attack a male with a long sword, they decrease their interest in long swords, and will then spend more time with a male with a short sword. Thus, the preference for long swords shows behavioral plasticity. Predation could also affect the importance of the sword in contests between males for females. The goal is to more fully understand the role predation plays in modifying both male and female responses to the sword. This will be accomplished by investigating the response of predators, female swordtails, and male swordtails to long swords. Plasticity in the sword response will also be studied. This research is important because despite a growing body of evidence indicating that pre-established biases can affect the subsequent expression of conspicuous characteristics, little is knowledge about how such biases currently function. With the proposed research, the swordtail system holds promise to shed light on broad questions concerning not only plasticity in behaviors that are important in mating, but also plasticity in receiver responses in general.

It is also one of the abilities more commonly affected by strokes as well as by hearing loss. Speech perception is characterized by considerable flexibility and robustness - we can understand speakers in noisy environments, and we can cope with<br/>variations in the speaker's gender, accent, or mood, all of which affect the nature of the speech signal we need to decode. A better understanding of the neural basis of speech perception, thus, impacts on clinical issues such as recovery from aphasic stroke, as well as on educational neuroscience, inasmuch as the studies will have relevance for second language learning and the development of multilingual children. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Josef Rauschecker seeks answers to understand the neural basis of speech perception. His studies will help to transfer knowledge gained from animal models of auditory perception toward the understanding of higher cognitive processes of speech and language perception in humans. The notions of hierarchical networks, processing streams, and higher-order computational maps have been used successfully in animal research on complex visual and auditory perception. Dr. Rauschecker will perform analogous investigations directly in humans using noninvasive,<br/>high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine activation of auditory cortices by speech and speech-like sounds. Using high-field fMRI the studies will not only determine the location of cortical areas activated by natural and synthetic speech sounds, as opposed to other sounds with similar complexity, but also for the first time reveal detailed<br/>organizational principles of higher-order acoustic-phonetic feature maps within human auditory and language cortex. The studies will provide a wealth of new information in the under-researched field of higher auditory pathways in humans, as well as insight into general organizational principles of<br/>functional architecture in cortical processing.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include opportunities for hands-on research experience by undergraduate and graduate students in Cognitive Neuroscience. This direct immersion into ongoing research will lead to tighter integration of teaching and research. The funded project will<br/>enhance the infrastructure for research at Georgetown University and contribute to two formal training programs offered at GU. The project will strive to increase further the number of minority students at all levels. It will broadly disseminate results through publications and public databases<br/>to scientific as well as lay audiences, thus, enhancing scientific understanding by the public.
0516846	A Study of the Larval-to-Adult Transition in Drososphila	IOS	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY CLUSTER	08/01/2005	07/28/2005	Thomas Kornberg	CA	University of California-San Francisco	Standard Grant	Chris T. Amemiya	07/31/2007	$301,410.00		tkornberg@biochem.ucsf.edu	1855 Folsom St Ste 425	San Francisco	CA	941034249	4154762977	BIO	7471	9183, BIOT	$0.00	PROJECT SUMMARY<br/><br/>This is a proposal to study how the dorsal air sacs of Drosophila adult develop. The dorsal air sacs are the major tracheal organs of the adult fly. They are complex, multi-lobed structures that function to fulfill the extreme demands of the indirect flight muscles for oxygen. Previous work in the Kornberg laboratory showed that dorsal air sac development begins during the third larval instar when a small group of cells in the wing imaginal disc produce FGF and this signaling protein induces nearby tracheal cells to embark on a program of growth and tubulogenesis. Their work also showed that long, cytoneme-like filopodia extend from the tracheal cells to the wing disc cells and that these cell extensions may serve as conduits for the movement of FGF between disc and tracheal cells. The studies proposed in this application delve further into the genesis of the dorsal air sacs, exploring how the cells of the wing disc and tracheal system interact to control the cell divisions, movements and growth during development of the dorsal air sacs. <br/><br/>Key issues addressed by this work are: <br/>1) Experiments are proposed that will test the possibility that the progenitor cells of the dorsal air sac are the products of a developmental program that replaces larval tracheal cells with imaginal tracheoblasts during the third instar. Preliminary data obtained in the Kornberg lab suggests that this program involves regulated cell proliferation, death and migration and that it is triggered locally by the molting hormone ecdysone. Surprisingly, the tracheal cells themselves may synthesize the ecdysone that initiates this program. The role of ecdysone in regulating this program will be examined.<br/>2) The genesis of most tubular organs in vertebrates involves extensive cell proliferation, but most tubular organs in Drosophila develop without cell proliferation. The dorsal air sacs are an exception, and experiments are proposed that will provide a better understanding of how cell proliferation is regulated and how it contributes to air sac development.<br/>3) Secreted proteins provide instructional signals during development, but we do not yet understand how they move over long distances to reach their target cells. The interactions between the wing disc and tracheae that regulate dorsal air sac development present an excellent system to study the mechanism of long distance signaling. The structures that are postulated to mediate signaling will be examined.<br/><br/>The proposed activities will be carried out as part of a training program for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the University of California, San Francisco and will include the participation of undergraduate students recruited to UCSF through their Summer Research Training Program that provides undergraduates, including under-represented minorities, with opportunities to conduct research.

However, conventional approaches to data integration do not have the necessary flexibility and adaptability to make the existing and future plethora of data accessible and usable to typical biologists, while keeping it rapidly extensible to new concepts, domains, and types of queries, and thus fostering new research developments. The main reasons are that (1) different biologists work with different types of data and at differing levels of abstraction; (2) schemas in the bioinformatics world are typically large and complex; (3) queries and mappings may break without warning because of asynchronous updates; (4) it is logistically, economically and politically difficult to operate centralized data integration facilities. In response to these difficulties data cooperatives emphasize: decentralization for both scalability and flexibility, incremental development of resources such as schemas, mappings, and queries, rapid discovery mechanisms for finding the resources relevant to a topic, and tolerance for intermittent participation of members and for approximate consistency of mappings.<br/>More specifically, the technical goals of the proposal include: (1)collaboratively developed yellow pages of biological topics; (2) schema templates, capturing the part of the structure of data pertaining to a specific interest and functioning also as visual templates from which a query form created; (3) incremental specification of mappings; (4) reasoning about uncertainty in mappings by measuring with statistical tools their degree of reliability and using it in query answering; (5) multi-path answering for queries with caching and replication in a large-scale data cooperative where the participation of individual members may not always be assured.<br/><br/>Data cooperatives will have broader impact through applications in a variety of scientific and industrial fields, but it is in the field of bioinformatics that they are likely to have an immediate and significant impact. Therefore, a specific data cooperative as a biological testbed for evaluating the proposed technologies. This testbed is based on a small set of databases which are already collaborating and exchanging data related to Plasmodium falciparum. Broader impact will be also be achieved through the proposed educational initiatives, specifically through a compu-tational orchestra bioinformatics course which will expose students to data integration issues through project work, and a workshop for the Greater Philadelphia Bioinformatics Alliance (GPBA). Minority involvement will also be encouraged through a GPBA internship program.

Our understanding of the ecology of rabies, a fatal neurological disease that affects all mammals, is based almost entirely on studies from Europe and North America where rabies rarely threatens human life. Across the developing world rabies has severe consequences; thousands of people die annually, subsistence communities suffer acute impacts from domestic animal losses, the economic burden of post-exposure treatment is considerable and the disease has caused localized extinctions of endangered wildlife. The ecology of rabies will be explored by collecting high resolution spatial and temporal data during an ongoing epidemic in Tanzania; collating regional incidence records; estimating abundance, distribution, and demography of infected species and incorporating these data into a theoretical framework to evaluate the effectiveness of disease management strategies. By combining empirical and theoretical analyses, this study will contribute to the theory of infectious disease ecology. Through involvement with local community members, veterinary and medical services, government officials, conservation organizations and policy makers, this project will facilitate communication, reinforce partnerships, build scientific, veterinary and medical capacity and educate communities, contributing towards sustainable solutions for zoonotic disease control. Results will be disseminated widely to inform local and international policy and raise the profile of this underreported disease. Ultimately, this research will promote understanding of neglected aspects of infection dynamics and development of better strategies to combat rabies. This project supports the dissertation research of a female doctoral candidate.

This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) the design and synthesis of complex organic molecules; b) the synthesis, characterization, binding and luminescent properties of metallocryptands; c) the synthesis, structure and reactivity of organometallic complexes with emphasis on those applicable to aqueous/biphasic catalysis; d) the designed synthesis of one-dimensional benzenoid nanostructures; e) the stereochemistry of bilirubin and its carboxylate anions in organic and aqueous media by heteronuclear NMR; and f) the behavior of transition and main group metals in biological systems. <br/><br/>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry, nanoscience and biochemistry.

The dream, however, far outstrips the reality: engineering new biological machines, programming cells behaviors, and building new forms of life pose huge technical and conceptual challenges. Our research is designed to make some important first steps, by developing generally-applicable engineering methods for building synthetic gene networks. Implementation of even the most simple circuits in a biological system requires tedious optimization of a large number of poorly-understood parameters, many of which can neither be measured nor easily manipulated. Simulations can sometimes guide optimization, but we believe that biological systems are best optimized using nature's editing strategy, evolution. We believe that a combined approach of rational design based on computational predictions coupled with directed evolution-making mutations in the laboratory and selecting those organisms exhibiting the desired behaviors--will be fundamental to the progress of synthetic biology. We will in effect learn how to 'breed' useful synthetic gene networks, just as we have learned how to breed useful plants and animals.<br/>This approach mimics natural evolution in exploring the vast and complex landscape of functions available to a set of molecules making up an engineered regulatory pathway. Importantly, it circumvents our near-complete ignorance of how a DNA sequence encodes a specific set of biological functions, a detailed understanding that is required for any 'rational' design approach. By introducing random mutations into the DNA and screening for different functions that might be expressed by the mutant circuits, we can identify which functions are possible as well as the ranges of function available to the specific search process (e.g. random point mutation targeted to a specific gene). With further analysis, e.g. sequencing to identify the mutations and biochemical analysis of circuit components, we gain insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the overall function is achieved or modified. <br/>In this project we have three specific aims. The first is to validate a 'selection module' by which we can efficiently evolve components and circuits in the laboratory. This module connects proper circuit function to the ability of cells that express it to survive and grow. Cells with functioning circuits survive and grow; those that have not solved the problem do not. To program complex behaviors, we will also need components that respond to predefined ranges of input parameters with predictable output parameters. Thus our second aim is to use directed evolution to create a range of transcriptional activators based on the well-characterized framework protein, LuxR. Laboratory-evolved LuxR variants will activate gene transcription at different, nonnatural promoter sites on the DNA. Finally, we propose to investigate the range of circuit functions available to a predefined set of components via evolutionary exploration. Specifically, we will evolve a series of 'band detect' circuits that respond to a prespecified range of acyl-HSL concentrations. These circuits will be used to construct synthetic systems that form patterns of gene expression in the solid phase.<br/>Our ultimate goal is to develop a fundamental enabling technology for synthetic biology as well as for developing bio-inspired modes and architectures for computing. We envision that evolved circuits and the synthetic multicellular systems that can be constructed from them will be useful to researchers developing quantitative models of gene regulation, quorum sensing, and other aspects of cellular computing.

The reagents proposed are more nucleophilic than current protocols which rely of on the use of substituents (stabilized ylides) and metal promoters (electrophilic alkylidine transfer agents) for reaction to occur. Chemoselective and diastereoselective reaction pathways can be tuned depending upon use of either sulfonium or sulfoxonium promoter. Targeted for exploration are catalysis, asymmetric induction, and substrate generality studies for a variety of transformations, including the formation of oxiranes from ketones and aldehydes, aziridines from imines, cyclopropanes from activated alkenes, oxetanes from oxiranes and azetidines from aziridines.<br/><br/>With the support of this RUI award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor David Forbes, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of South Alabama, is developing new methods for the synthesis of molecules containing three-membered rings. Using sulfur-containing reagents, Professor Forbes and his students are able to construct such cyclic compounds efficiently and selectively, affording access to molecular structures which are themselves significant or which can serve as intermediates in the synthesis of the more complex molecules forming the basis of modern biochemical and pharmaceutical research. Research in Professor Forbes' laboratory is carried out primarily by undergraduates, and an area high school teacher, selected through the Alabama Science in Motion program, will also be involved.

The research is aimed to develop a unified microscopic description of polymer dynamics for systems in different thermodynamic and dynamical conditions. The main focus here is on polymer liquids and their mixtures. <br/><br/>Several rigorous theoretical approaches have been developed in the past to describe<br/>polymer dynamics. However, each one specifically describes a well-defined phenomenon. Sometimes two approaches to the same phenomenon stand on physically incompatible hypotheses (e.g., compressible or incompressible fluids). Our approach is microscopic and system-specific. It predicts dynamical properties on the basis of local chemical structure, specific intra- and intermolecular interactions, and physical parameters. So far, our approach has successfully explained the experimentally observed center-of-mass anomalous diffusion and the anomalous relaxation of normal modes in polymer melts, on the basis of intermolecular time dependent correlation of polymer chains due to the dynamically heterogeneous nature of polymer liquids.<br/><br/>We will optimize our microscopic theoretical approach working in several directions. First, our approach will be extended to polymer mixtures. A new analytical form of the intermolecular potential for polymer melts and blends will be implemented: predictions of<br/>dynamical quantities will be tested against microscopic simulations. Second, we will investigate cooperative effects (of intra- and intermolecular origin) on local and global polymer dynamics. Finally, we will develop a coarse-graining procedure to optimize the computational time in simulations of polymer liquids.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>The development of a theoretical tool that formally correlates the effect of physical and<br/>chemical parameters (e.g., polymer molecular weight, density concentration, and temperature) and local molecular structure to the global dynamical properties (e.g., viscosity, glass transition temperature) will provide essential information in designing custom-tailored syntheses of new polymeric materials. A unified approach to polymer dynamics will help developing a comprehensive understanding of polymer motion. The latter has been a long-standing goal of both practical and fundamental interest in polymer physics, since all polymeric materials (fibers, plastics, coating materials, etc.) are processed in their liquid state. Five women (undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral associates) and one Hispanic student have been involved in this project. Collaborations with experimental groups at the University of Oregon have produced important interactions for the students in the project. Students have been involved in outreach activities to publicize our research and the University of Oregon to undergraduate institutions and high-school students of Hispanic descent. The introduction of educational modules on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of<br/>polymer fluids has enriched undergraduate courses taught by the P.I. at the junior and senior levels.

Furthermore, fabrication methods currently in place are inherently limited to two dimensional arrangements of components. With the research to be pursued under this award, we plan to address both of those problems: We will develop methods to assemble computing components from the bottom-up, using chemical methods. In addition, we will extend our ability to assemble computational elements from two dimensions to three dimensions.<br/><br/>How do we plan to accomplish these ambitious goals? We will use the most effective and selective self-assembling system that is found in nature -- DNA. We are all aware that DNA serves as the genetic material of living organisms, from bacteria to humans. One of the key features of DNA that enables it to fulfill this role is complementarity between the two strands of the double helix: If one side of the helix contains a unit known as an A, the other side will always have another unit know as a T; likewise, two further complementary units known as G and C work in the same way. We now live in an era when it is very easy to synthesize DNA strands with particular sequences on them, so we can program a given strand on one side, and then make its complementary strand on the other side. Furthermore, DNA is a nanoscale object, with a width of about 2 nm, and a helical repeat of about 3.5 nm. In addition, DNA is the molecule whose intermolecular interactions are the most readily programmed, from the perspectives both of affinity (which molecules will bind to which others), and structure (what will they look like when they combine). This intermolecular programming is accomplished by using short single-stranded segments on the ends of each molecule, which are called 'sticky ends'.<br/><br/>But wait. Nature already makes linear DNA molecules in profusion. Synthetic molecules would just be relatively short 'lines' of matter, so what use would they be? The advantage of synthetic DNA molecules is that they can be programmed to associate into branched, rather than linear molecules. Thus, joining a bunch of linear DNA molecules together can lead to longer lines, but joining branched molecules together can lead to connected networks of DNA. In the past, we have built a variety of two dimensional crystalline arrays with specific patterns; to do this we have designed DNA strands to form two dimensional motifs that could they self-assembled using sticky ends. In the research to be pursued under this award, we will design and self-assemble motifs that will form motifs that self-assemble to produce three dimensional arrays, related to conventional crystals, such as sugar crystals, except that their repeating units will be much larger. We will characterize these molecules using the standard method for examining three-dimensional matter, x-ray crystallography.<br/><br/>How does the assembly of three dimensional DNA crystals relate to revolutionary computing? We have just discussed that DNA has outstanding architectural properties. However, it does not seem well-suited to serve as a computational component. By contrast, there are numerous newly discovered nanoscale-sized systems, such as carbon nanotubes or quantum dots that would seem to be ideal for computational purposes, if only we could organize them into circuitry for our purposes. Once we are able to assemble DNA into three-dimensional arrangements, we will undertake to use its architectural features to act as scaffolding in three dimensions for electronic components such as these. Thus, we will combine the outstanding architectural properties of DNA, which we know how to control, with demonstrated outstanding electronic components to form circuitry in three dimensions. This achievement ultimately will lead to extremely dense memory units and extremely rapid computation.

Feng, Univ California/ Ivine)<br/>0510655 (Chin-An Tang, Wayne Statye Univ)<br/><br/>In the long-term health monitoring of bridge structures, system identification that is essential for assessing the global condition of the bridge is often based on measured vibration response or the system output. Two major obstacles remain in the path to realization of an integrated health monitoring system. First, knowledge of the input (i.e., traffic excitation) is unknown or limited, rendering an accurate assessment of the state of the bridge structures difficult. Second, efficient procedure must be developed for processing and interpreting the vast amount of data from sensors. This research focuses on developing a novel, video-assisted approach for enhancing bridge health monitoring. Important traffic information characterizing the input excitation, such as the vehicle arrival times, speeds and types, is proposed to be extracted from digital video. Since camera systems are readily available in many existing bridges (as surveillance cameras), this proposal represents a low-cost approach to significantly enhance our understanding of the traffic input. Novel algorithms for processing and analyzing synchronized traffic information and bridge vibration data will perform integrated system identification and improve the health monitoring <br/>This is a joint research between two universities encompassing the expertise necessary for the successful completion of this project. Professor Tan and Professor Yin from WSU will be in charge of (1) development and verification of the traffic excitation model and the bridge damage diagnosis on a statistical basis, (2) vehicle classification from the video pattern recognition and (3) web-based data sharing and presentation of the monitoring project for educational purpose. Professor Feng at UCI will take the lead in (1) installation of weather-proof video cameras and field data collection at a fully instrumented bridge, (2) development of real-time algorithms on a chip allowing transmission of processed traffic data to significantly reduce the amount of data transmission and (3) development of system identification algorithms based on system output and partial input information obtained from the video.

Topics in symplectic geometry aim to both apply and<br/>extend the ideas and theorems of the Symplectic Field Theory as<br/>developed by Eliashberg, Givental and Hofer. The main application<br/>so far is to the classification up to Hamiltonian diffeomorphism<br/>of Lagrangian spheres in symplectic 4-manifolds, there is ongoing<br/>work aimed at establishing similar results for higher genus<br/>surfaces. In symplectic topology such classification results at<br/>present only exist in dimension 4. Nevertheless the proposal will<br/>also strive to increase our understanding of higher dimensions.<br/>One route to such an understanding is provided by work of<br/>Donaldson showing that, after a blowing-up operation, every<br/>integral symplectic 6-manifold can be realized as a Lefschetz<br/>fibration in which the fibers are symplectic 4-manifolds and the<br/>vanishing cycles Lagrangian spheres. Regarding the underlying<br/>theory, Symplectic Field Theory allows us to split a symplectic<br/>manifold along a hypersurface and apply holomorphic curve methods<br/>to study each part separately. This is a very powerful idea, the<br/>results above rely heavily upon it, but it is fundamentally<br/>limited in that it may not be possible to split a symplectic<br/>manifold along such hypersurfaces into pieces which are<br/>sufficiently small to be completely understood. Therefore the<br/>proposal will also work to generalize the Symplectic Field Theory<br/>to allow more general splittings, for example along hypersurfaces<br/>with corners. In complex geometry the proposal plans to continue<br/>work of Burns and Hind studying complex manifolds canonically<br/>associated to real analytic Riemannian manifolds, focussing<br/>especially on the case when the Riemannian manifold is a<br/>symmetric space of the noncompact type. Then we have a class of<br/>complex manifolds which gives a nice generalization of the<br/>classical bounded symmetric domains.<br/><br/>Symplectic geometry originated as the modern mathematical<br/>language of classical and quantum mechanics. This proposal will<br/>address basic mathematical problems in the area, in particular it<br/>will apply and extend the powerful new techniques known as<br/>Symplectic Field Theory. The Symplectic Field Theory is an<br/>exciting new development which promises to help us move rapidly<br/>towards our goal of describing the global nature of symplectic<br/>manifolds and Hamiltonian systems. As the problems are global in<br/>nature often they initially appear intractible, but the new<br/>methods offer the prospect of breaking down our analysis into<br/>more manageable local pieces. Eventually it should be possible to<br/>develop algorithms to solve typical problems in symplectic<br/>geometry. This will have immediate applications to theoretical<br/>physics and dynamical systems.

We will address two sets of important and closely related technical issues for this high-end scientific computing project. First, the targeted problems for the proposed project are large-scale direct and inverse scattering problems that can be only solved in high-end systems. These problems involve<br/>particularly electromagnetic wave propagation with high wave numbers. A major difficulty for solving the inverse problems by an optimization method is the ill-posedness and the presence of many local minima. We propose a novel approach for solving the inverse medium scattering problem of Maxwell's equations in three dimensions. Crucial to the approach will be the development of an efficient regularized iterative linearization algorithm (recursive linearization with respect to the wave number). A challenge in<br/>developing our numerical methods is to deal with large and structured data sets. The second set of technical issues for solving the targeted problems is concerned with the lack of system support in high-end architectures to maintain high sustained performance of<br/>computing due to increasingly high speed gap between the CPU and the memory and the I/O storage. This challenge can also be found in many other large scientific computation problems on high-end systems. An equivalently important objective to the scientific computing in this proposal is to design and build effective system support by effectively allocating both CPU and memory resources, by establishing a global network RAM system in high-end architecture, and by providing exceptional system handlers to deal with dynamic and unexpectedlylarge memory demands from applications.<br/><br/>Intellectual merits of this proposal come from several aspects. (1) Our proposed numerical methods will address several scientific challenges in applied mathematics including electromagnetic wave propagation with high wave numbers, ill-posedness for inverse problems, and management of large data sets in multiple dimensions. (2) Processors and high-end systems have become increasingly complex, which makes the understanding of execution behavior more and more difficult. Our proposed system support based on both hardware counters and a system kernel instrumentation tool will address the system complexity issue, and provide insightful runtime system information for resource management systems with low overhead. (3) In order to effectively support high sustained performance and high productivity computing in clusters, our system support aims for several important resource management objectives, such as high memory utilization, low communication latency, and fast response time. (4) Although our system will be mainly tested by solving the large direct and inverse problems, it is also our aim to build it as a general purpose system so that it will become a fundamental software system infrastructure for many other large scientific applications in high-end systems.<br/><br/>Broader impact of this proposal will be: (1) Due to the fast development of high performance systems, computational electromagnetics has become a fundamental, vigorously growing technology in diverse science and engineering disciplines, such as<br/>microwaves, millimeter waves, optics, and acoustics. Our computational models and cluster system support will provide an inexpensive and easily controllable ``virtual prototype of the structures/media as opposed to costly, time-consuming physical<br/>prototyping. (2) The proposed system resource management tools and system prototype will be disseminated in the high-end computing and systems community for a wide usage. (3) The research results will be timely introduced to both undergraduate and graduate curriculum development of scientific computing, parallel computing, and operating systems.

The second problem the investigator <br/>will address is the development and properties of response-adaptive <br/>randomization procedures, including procedures designed for continuous <br/>responses, and survival responses with censoring. The third problem the <br/>investigator will address is certain theoretical properties of <br/>covariate-adaptive randomization procedures, particularly <br/>randomization-based inference procedures following covariate-adaptive <br/>randomization. The ultimate goal of the investigator is to complete a <br/>systmeatic study of randomization, its properties, and its relevance in <br/>clinical trials.<br/><br/>The investigator will explore properties of randomization, the hallmark of <br/>a well-designed clinical trial. The first problem the investigator will <br/>address is sequential monitoring of randomized clinical trials, which <br/>refers to making early decisions about the effectiveness of new therapies <br/>when compelling evidence is accrued at an interim point in a clinical <br/>trial. There are currently no sequential monitoring techniques available <br/>that allow the randomization itself to be incorporate into these <br/>decisions, and hence current methodology completely ignores the design of <br/>the trial in the analysis. The second problem the investigator will <br/>address is response-adaptive randomization, and he will develop new <br/>procedures for clinical trials where the outcome is time-to-event or some <br/>continous measure, e.g. cholesterol level. These response-adaptive <br/>procedures are attractive from an ethical point of view, because they seek <br/>to maximize power to detect a relevant clinical outcome, while <br/>simultaneously minimizing the expected number of treatment failures <br/>patients will experience while participating in the clinical trial. The <br/>third problem the investigator will address is proporties of <br/>covariate-adaptive randomization procedures, which is designed to minimize <br/>tial imbalances in important confounding variables that might bias results <br/>of the clinical trial. Each of these topics is relevant to today's <br/>clinical trials in the drug development phase of new pharmaceuticals.

Intellectual merit. The purpose of this program is to provide doctoral students with enhanced multidisciplinary training in the skills required for conducting research at the interface of the biospheric and atmospheric sciences. The over-arching research theme is to improve the understanding of the interactions and feedbacks that occur between biospheric and atmospheric properties and processes. Broader impacts include the training in this new environmental discipline. BART builds on the unique collection of scientists, research projects and academic programs that exist at UMBS. BART training commences with a novel 10-week residential research experience. Students conduct research on atmospheric composition, atmospheric flux measurements, and ecosystem dynamics using state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. Each student has two co-mentors for his/her doctoral career: an atmospheric scientist and a biospheric scientist. During Phase II, students will participate in a new University of Michigan course in the Essentials of Biosphere-Atmosphere Interactions. Lectures will be based upon material developed for BART Phase I Fundamentals Workshops, and the course will have a new, extensive laboratory component. Phase II Students will also have the opportunity to participate in technical short courses (e.g., in Ecophyisological Methods, Heat, Radiative, and Gaseous Species Exchange, and Atmospheric Monitoring) and a biennial International Conference. As in Phase I, Phase II students will also participate in reading groups and Perspectives Workshops (e.g. on policy, industry, mentoring, and grantsmanship). In addition to the residential research experience, students receive continuing multidisciplinary training including an annual workshop and participation in atmospheric and biospheric professional conferences. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.

The promise of being able to exchange any amount of information, anytime, anywhere is prompting more and more subscribers to rely solely on their wireless devices for communicating sensitive nformation. As a result, offering a wide range of wireless services to more subscribers while preserving the security of information is becoming essential. Wireless system design efforts so far has aimed solely on providing high capacity. This research nvestigates the fundamental design principles of high capacity ireless systems that ensure secure information delivery.<br/><br/>This research includes the development of a comprehensive framework for the design of the multiuser physical layer that aims at achieving high capacity and secure transmissions for all users. The research addresses the existence of intruders that aim to disrupt communication by creating intentional interference, i.e., jammers; intruders that intercept the communication and attempt to decode the information of the users, i.e., eavesdroppers; and intruders that listen in on the communication and then create intentional interference accordingly, i.e., correlated jammers. Assuming a variety of levels at which the intruders are capable to harm the multiuser system, and using these scenarios as additional design constraints in the physical layer design, this research seeks to establish the performance limits of a variety of multiuser systems in nonfading and fading channels in the presence of security threats; the ways in which the system entities, i.e., transmitters and receivers, can collectively cope with security threats at the physical layer; and the jointly optimum transmit strategies for the users that render the intruders ineffective. The investigators study a variety of multiuser channels including scalar, waveform and vector multiple access and broadcast scenarios, as well as relay and cooperative communication scenarios and identify the fundamental design trade-offs for capacity versus security for a variety of wireless networks.

The objective of this research is to develop high-performance materials for thermoelectric applications. Thermoelectric devices are currently used for solid-state cooling and the direct conversion of thermal to electrical power. The applications of these devices are limited, however, by their low efficiency. This project will develop composite materials consisting of a chain of nanometer-sized semiconducting particles (nanoparticles) linked by a conducting polymer. This material architecture will take advantage of the enhanced electrical properties of nanometer-scale semiconducting materials combined with the low thermal conductivity of the polymer. This combination of properties is expected to provide measurable improvements over today's thermoelectric materials. The approach is to chemically synthesize nanoparticles, mix them with specific organic molecules (monomers) and electrochemically polymerize the monomer inside nanometer-sized channels of a ceramic template. The electrical and thermal properties of the composite will be measured, analyzed and evaluated. The most significant challenge is creating a suitable electrical connection between the polymer and semiconducting particle. This will be addressed by chemically coating the particles with organic molecules which attach to the particle's surface on one end of the molecule and electrically link to the polymer on the other.<br/><br/>The outcome of this project will impact both solid-state cooling and power generation technologies. Enhancements in thermoelectric materials would enable devices which could efficiently convert thermal to electrical power using waste heat or using the normal temperature differences of the environment (so-called energy harvesting applications). A large enough enhancement (~ factor of 4 over existing materials) would give thermoelectrics a competitive advantage in air conditioning and refrigeration. It might also make feasible cryogenic electronics and computing, providing new opportunities for electronic devices based on superconductivity and other low temperature phenomena.

However, a comprehensive understanding of the fatigue and fracture behavior of nanostructured materials is currently unavailable. Furthermore, the potential for enhancing the fatigue life of conventional materials through the creation of nanostructured surface layers/coatings has not been explored in sufficient depth. Hence, this project is directed towards obtaining key insights on the fatigue phenomenon in nanostructured materials. Through an approach that combines analytical modeling, numerical modeling, and experiments on model nanostructured metallic systems (nickel and iron), this study lays the foundation for: (i) a fundamental understanding of the plain fatigue and fatigue crack growth response of nanostructured materials; (ii) a quantitative assessment of the contact fatigue response of nanostructured materials; (iii) a unique application of a novel adhesion model for the prediction of contact fatigue crack initiation in nanostructured materials; and (iv) the development of a simplified numerical model for contact fatigue life prediction in nanostructured materials. <br/><br/>The present study leads to broad impact at the following three levels: (i) Research: By advancing the current understanding of the mechanisms associated with fatigue of nanostructured materials, the research activities provide scientific and technological impact in the tribology industry (including aircraft, automotive, and bio-medical, fatigue-sensitive applications). Comprehensive research training is imparted to one graduate student. Because Louisiana's research investment has been significantly lower than in other states, the project activities also enhance the state's research base and educational efforts in the field of nanotechnology. (ii) Educational experience for minorities: In conjunction with this research project, a graduate/undergraduate course on Deformation, Fatigue and Fracture that has been developed by the PI, is enhanced to provide an exciting hands-on experimental component to the class-room learning experience about the fatigue phenomenon. Furthermore, the modified coursework is also targeted towards enhancing the undergraduate learning experience for minority students at Xavier University, a Historically Black College and University, through it's 3+2 program with the School of Engineering at Tulane University, where Xavier undergraduates complete a pre-engineering curriculum in three years and then complete their engineering courses at Tulane. (iii) Research experience for minorities: By working with the Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation program, the PI's research group also provides summer research opportunities for undergraduate students in the area of fatigue of nanomaterials.
0510326	Collaborative Research: Linking Deep and Shallow Crustal Processes in a Continental Arc, North Cascades, Washington	EAR	TECTONICS	07/01/2005	04/04/2007	Donna Whitney	MN	University of Minnesota-Twin Cities	Continuing grant	David Fountain	06/30/2009	$128,888.00		dwhitney@umn.edu	200 OAK ST SE	Minneapolis	MN	554552070	6126245599	GEO	1572	0000	$0.00	Mountain belts formed by collisions between continents, and continental volcanic arcs constructed during compression, have large-scale similarities, including markedly thickened crust. In the past decade, many researchers have tried to explain the large-scale patterns of collisional mountain belts, such as the Himalayas, using models of flow of partially molten mid- to lower crust. In contrast, there have been few studies of crustal flow in exhumed continental arcs. The North Cascades, Washington, is an exhumed Late Cretaceous (circa 90 million years ago) arc, which includes rocks that were once at depths of 35-40 km and are now exposed at the surface. This mountain range also displays evidence for uplift and erosion during formation of adjacent non-marine sedimentary basins in the Eocene (approximately 50-45 million years ago); these basins are filled with the eroded debris. Field-based structural study and laboratory analytical work (geochronology, petrology, microstructural analysis) are being carried out by an interdisciplinary team of geologists to determine the timing of metamorphism, partial melting, exhumation of deep crustal rocks, and basin formation and evolution in the Cascades. These studies are aimed at providing a view of the construction and collapse of a continental arc analogous to the Altiplano region of the modern Andes in Bolivia and Argentina. Much of the research is focused on the Skagit Gneiss Complex of the North Cascades. These rocks record a history of partial melting, which probably occurred during exhumation of the mountain belt. The gneiss is bounded in part by low-angle structures that resemble detachment faults. Relationships between flow of these migmatites and bounding units have not been previously studied, but can provide information about the coupling or decoupling of deep and shallow crustal processes. Kinematics of deformation are being analyzed over a range of structural depths to determine the directions and conditions of crustal flow, and whether flow occurred in a channel parallel or oblique to the edge of the North American plate boundary. Eocene basins that flank the North Cascades contain thick sedimentary sequences deposited by rivers in a system of strike-slip and normal faults. Volcanic tuffs interlayered with the sedimentary rocks facilitate dating of the time of basin initiation, and the rates of deposition. Vast swarms of Eocene dikes intrude both crystalline rocks and basins. A major goal of the mapping and dating of the dikes is to provide a record of regional deformation during exhumation of the mountain belt and basin formation. The orientation of these structures can be compared to the flow directions recorded by the migmatites. This research involves three graduate, undergraduate research assistants, and summer interns. The principal investigators are conducting a field trip to the North Cascades involving students from all three universities, and are publishing an illustrated, data-filled field guide related to the trip and the research results on the internet.

In addition, with the Federal mandate of no child left behind an increasing national priority is learning objectives that prepare students to do well on national standardized tests, and many of these learning objectives rely on literacy skills. Yet literacy remains a critical unsolved issue in our educational system, with national test scores showing that non-white children (e.g., African Americans and Hispanics) still score well below their Caucasian counterparts. Increasingly, approaches to this problem derive from the recognition that primary school education is based on a set of mainstream oral practices and literacy-preparation skills. Because many children do not share the same cultural experiences typical of mainstream culture, educational practitioners have applied a cultural-historical approach to identify common characteristics of ethnic groups, and then designed cultural supports for literacy learning by children of diverse backgrounds. But while classroom practice has been influenced by this approach, and training programs for parents have been instituted along these lines, it has been rare to see technological learning environments that leverage diversity in any but the most superficial ways (for example identical content characters with different skin color, or content based on traditional associations such as the Anancy myths). The PI believes she can do much better. To this end, in the current project she will first conduct an in-depth investigation into African-American peer-oriented oral language and literacy practices, in order to understand how cultural practices support individual learning and development in this population. Using these findings, she will then design a virtual peer that engages in authentic cultural practices with African-American children as a bridge to school-based literacy. As the technology is developed, the PI will bring it into classrooms and community centers, formatively evaluating and iteratively redesigning as necessary until the virtual peer is capable of being like African-American children in important ways, can exploit that affinity to establish rapport, and can leverage this rapport and linguistic interaction to help the child acquire literacy skills. Project outcomes will include a rich comparative description of the language and nonverbal practices of African-American and Caucasian children in peer-emergent literacy interaction, a set of behaviors that allow a virtual human to establish rapport with users (including local-level moment-by-moment interactional behaviors and larger scale culturally specific practices), and a Flash virtual peer and set of virtual peer behaviors that have been shown to improve literacy in the children interacting with the virtual peer, both for Standard American English (SAE) speakers and African American Vernacular English (AAVE) speakers. A summative evaluation will address transfer from interaction with the virtual peer to other standard literacy contexts and tests. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project addresses fundamental issues relating to acquisition of literacy skills by young children who are members of an underserved population, and will lead to new technology for improving their literacy readiness. The PI will pursue an innovative program of dissemination of results and research practices that involves undergraduates from HBCUs, local schools with high populations of African Americans, and local churches and community centers, in order to broaden in the short term participation by African-American undergraduates in the engineering research behind this project and in the longer term participation in STEM by young African-American school children.

Changes of the genus of this surface correspond to phase transitions in the evolution of our initial data. The pure radiational case was <br/>studied completely in the joint work with Venakides and Zhou. Here we propose to study <br/>phase transitions in the most difficult case that includes both solitons and radiation. <br/>B) It has been recently proved (Tovbis, Pelinovsky) that persistence of homoclinic/heteroclinic <br/>solutions to singularly perturbed 5th Kortveg - de Vries (KdV) equation can be expressed in terms of the Stokes' constants of certain (leading order) rescaled system. The proposed <br/>goal is to develop the corresponding technique to other types of solutions and <br/>systems, including stationary and moving travelling waves on lattices for NLS <br/>and other models. <br/><br/>It is well known that only a tiny portion of nonlinear systems used to model real world problems <br/>allows for explicit form mathematical solutions, leaving approximate methods <br/>and computer simulations to be the most used tools. Asymptotic methods play a prominent <br/>role among approximate methods, as it is often easier to study a system in some <br/>asymptotic limit (say, infinite time) and then to allow some ``small corrections for large <br/>but finite values of time. This approach was used for centures, for example, in celestian mechanics. However, ``small corrections are not necessarily small if the original and the limiting <br/>systems exibit qualitatively different behavior. For example, a weakly coupled system <br/>of 2nd order nonlinear oscillators generically has a chaotic behavior whereas the limiting system <br/>of uncoupled oscillators has no chaos. Such systems, called singularly perturbed, are the <br/>most difficult subject in the asymptotic analysis. The current proposal is focused on <br/>two still developing methods for singularly perturbed nonlinear problems: the method of <br/>RHP and of asymptotics beyond all orders. The first method will be used to find small dispersion limit of the focusing NLS - the problem that was open for many years. The NLS is the most frequently used model for nonlinear waves phenomena in physics, engineering, etc. The second method will be used to find when travelling waves solutions to KdV, NLS and some other integrable models survive singular perturbations, including discretizations. Solitons and travelling waves on lattices (discretized models) are rapidly becoming a very important topic, for example, in fiber optics (including periodic optical structures), design of computational numerical methods, etc.

Ann M. Fraser (Kalamazoo College) and John E. Hofferberth (Kenyon College). <br/>How new species arise is an enduring question in biology. The study of host selection behavior in herbivorous insects has provided important insights by demonstrating that shifts in host preference can evolve rapidly and that local adaptation to novel hosts can initiate genetic divergence and thus play an important role in the early stages of the speciation process. Underlying host specificity and host shifts are complex chemosensory mechanisms that mediate behavioral responses to host stimuli. Elucidating these mechanisms and their role in ecological specialization and reproductive isolation, therefore, is important to our understanding of the speciation process. Building on studies of herbivorous insects and their association with plants, this project seeks to understand how obligate association with ants may enhance diversification in the butterfly family Lycaenidae. Using the Australian butterfly genus Jalmenus and their attendant Iridomyrmex ants as a model, this collaborative research project aims to elucidate the olfactory cues used by butterflies to locate and identify appropriate ant partners, and to characterize the degree to which butterfly populations exhibit local adaptation with respect to host ant selection. To elucidate the olfactory cues, butterfly antennae will be screened for electrophysiological responses to volatile components emitted by ants. Electrophysiologically-active compounds will be chemically synthesized to verify identifications and then tested for behavioral activity using attraction and egg-laying bioassays. Electrophysiological and behavioral studies will be conducted in Fraser's laboratory at Kalamazoo College and in Australia. Chemical syntheses and identifications will be carried out in Hofferberth's laboratory at Kenyon College. The results of this research will broaden our understanding of how host recognition mechanisms and host selection behavior influence the speciation process in taxa that have close associations with other species. This project will provide undergraduate students with research opportunities that integrate biological and chemical approaches to address broad evolutionary questions, and teach skills that are useful for basic and applied research. This project will also provide the PIs with an opportunity to engage in multidisciplinary research and to establish collaborations with international researchers in Australia.

Thus, Horn of Africa and neighboring regions on the Arabian Peninsula are critical to our understanding of the worldwide dispersal of humans out of Africa. There is a dearth of information available on key populations in this region, particularly in southern Arabia. The proposed study combines fieldwork, original laboratory and computational analyses, international collaborations, and innovative outreach programs to reconstruct population movements critical in the dispersal of humans. The project will provide powerful tests of the best current hypotheses of human migrations and generate new data to design future hypotheses. The project builds on past success in reconstructing simple migration histories (Europe and the New World) and serves as a model to determine the utility of genetic variation patterning and phylogenetic methods to reconstruct more complex migration histories.<br/> Eight hundred DNA samples from linguistically and geographically diverse populations in Eritrea (Horn of Africa) and Oman (southern Arabia) will be assayed for genetic variation across the mitochondrial genome and the Y chromosome. These data will be used to formulate new hypotheses as well as to test the following hypotheses: 1) a southern dispersal route out of Africa, 2) migration and back-migration between Horn of Africa and Arabia, and 3) expansion of the Semitic language family.<br/>Broader impact. 1) An important component of the proposed project is an expedition to collect blood samples in Eritrea (previously unsampled) and Oman (one published study). Genetics workshops will be taught in Eritrea and Oman and necessary laboratory equipment will be donated to each host institution. Aliquots of all collected samples will be shared with Eritrean and Omani colleagues. The proposed collaboration will allow African and Arabian collaborators to retain control of their own genetic resources as well as develop and direct independent research in the future. Eritrean colleagues have already developed a project to investigate resistance to malaria in Eritreans, a subject of national priority. 2) Furthermore, a unique program has been developed in which University of Florida journalism and communications graduate students will participate in University of Florida Department of Anthropology research projects in order to gain hands-on laboratory experience and create a media product for inclusion in their graduate portfolio. This program will have maximum impact because it provides training to the individuals charged with communicating current scientific research to the general public.

While fuel cell electrodes typically have a complex micro- or nano-structure that is critically important in determining their performance, current methods for measuring electrode structure are quite limited. The aim of the proposed project is to develop analysis and simulation tools to characterize the three-dimensional electrode microstructure and to understand microstructural evolution and the resulting electrochemical performance. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: A main aim of this research is to fully understand the relationships between electrode processing, structure, properties, and performance. This will ultimately allow design of higher performance and more stable electrode microstructures, as well as providing processing information needed to achieve these structures. The new methods and understanding will be included in new university course materials and in educational modules designed to reach a broad spectrum of age groups. This research is a collaborative effort with Northwestern University and University of Washington.

Two unique tools, the MIT-developed Nanoruler, which is a grating patterning and reading tool, and the UNCC-MIT developed Sub-Atomic Measuring Machine (SAMM), which is a metrology and imaging tool, will be modified to meet these new accuracy targets. The SAMM will be used to characterize errors in the Nanogrids. Nanogrids will also be used by NIST and our industrial partners and the accuracy on nanoimprinted Nanogrids will be investigated.<br/><br/>The results of this research will enable the commercialization of numerous new nanotechnology tools as well as educate a new generation of students in nano-precision engineering. The program will also supplement our public outreach which includes significant K-12 programming and participation.

It supports an interdisciplinary research effort that will investigate the quantum dynamics of chemically synthesized magnetic nanostructures. The miniaturization of magnetic devices to this size is critical to advances in magnetic information processing, which is an important industry in the United States. Conventional techniques used to fabricate magnetic nanostructures have serious limitations. For this reason, there is a growing interest in chemical syntheses that provide a bottom-up or molecule-based approach to the assembly of magnetic nanostructures--often, with atomic scale control of magnetic structure. This project will focus on the magnetization dynamics and how the environment of the nanomagnet affects these dynamics. For a large magnet, this coupling leads to energy dissipation or magnetic friction. For magnetic nanostructures the environment also leads to the loss of quantum information, known as decoherence. An important aim of this project is to understand the microscopic mechanisms of energy dissipation and decoherence in nanomagnets, and to develop synthetic strategies to mitigate certain environmental effects, such as decoherence. Chemical synthesis of magnetic nanostructures will be combined with advanced magnetic measurement techniques, which include high-speed high-sensitivity magnetometry, magnetic resonance and neutron scattering.

It supports an interdisciplinary research effort that will investigate the quantum spin dynamics of nanometer-sized single-molecule magnets (SMMs) using a bottom-up or molecule-based approach. This is a powerful approach in which magnetic nanostructures are synthesized chemically using solution methods. An understanding of the dynamics of nanomagnets is important to technological applications. Of particular interest, and very poorly understood at present, is how the coupling between spins and their environment affect their dynamics. In classical magnetism this coupling leads to dissipation and damping of the magnetization precession. In the quantum case, interaction with the environment limits the spin coherence time and leads to the loss of quantum information. This research program will study: quantum magnetization dynamics; energy and angular momentum relaxation; and spin-excitations in nanomagnets. An important aim is to further understand the microscopic mechanisms of dissipation and decoherence in nanomagnets, and to develop synthetic strategies to mitigate certain environmental effects, such as decoherence. The following experimental techniques will be employed, pulsed EPR, time-resolved and high-sensitivity magnetometry, NMR and inelastic neutron scattering. The latter technique is available to this team through a partnership with Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL). This program will provide the highest quality interdisciplinary research training to a diverse group of undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral scientists, which will include training in new chemical synthesis methods and advanced magnetic measurement techniques. The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry provide support for this project.
0510054	Integrated Physical and Chemical Observations of Water-rock Interactions and Coupled Matrix-conduit Flow in the Karstic Floridan Aquifer	EAR	HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES	08/01/2005	05/22/2007	Jonathan Martin	FL	University of Florida	Continuing grant	Thomas Torgersen	07/31/2010	$321,983.00	Elizabeth Screaton	jbmartin@ufl.edu	1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA	GAINESVILLE	FL	326112002	3523923516	GEO	1579	9189, EGCH	$0.00	0510054<br/>Martin<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. It has been recognized recently that the flow field of karst<br/>aquifers includes conduits, fractures, and intergranular porosity of the matrix and that full<br/>characterization of flow requires understanding flow in each component, coupling<br/>between the components, and how water recharges to the aquifer from the surface. Most<br/>well-studied karst aquifers have low intergranular porosity where diffuse flow is confined<br/>to a network of fine fractures surrounding conduits. In contrast, this proposed work<br/>centers on the Floridan aquifer, which retains high (up to ~20%) intergranular matrix<br/>porosity. Previous work on physical hydrogeology (discharge measurements,<br/>temperature tracing of flow rates, observations of hydraulic head), suggests that water<br/>exchanged between conduits and the matrix of the Floridan aquifer is controlled by<br/>reversals in head gradients between the matrix and conduits as a result of high allogenic<br/>input into the conduit system. The previous work has not quantified contributions from<br/>diffuse recharge from the surface, the magnitude of exchange between the conduits and<br/>matrix, the residence time of water that exchanges, or chemical modifications of the<br/>aquifer through dissolution reactions. Consequently, this proposed project will determine<br/>coupling between aquifer components and water sources by integrating new chemical<br/>measurements with previously used physical observational techniques.<br/>The field area will be the Santa Fe Sink/Rise system in north-central Florida.<br/>Observations to be made will include major element and isotope compositions of water<br/>from nested new and existing wells and lysimeters (soil water samplers) for ground water<br/>characterization, from the River Sink, Rise, and karst windows for characterization of<br/>conduit water, and from precipitation for characterization of the input sources. The<br/>chemical measurements will provide flow velocities to be compared with head gradients<br/>between the conduits and the matrix and saturation states with respect to carbonate and<br/>silicate minerals. The nested wells and data on chemical composition of precipitation<br/>will allow characterization of vertical differences in water chemistry to determine<br/>magnitudes of diffuse recharge from the surface. These data will be compared to other<br/>karst aquifers with low intergranular porosity using available deterministic models such<br/>as chemograph separation. Comparisons will also be made to results of previous and ongoing<br/>studies of other regions of the Floridan aquifer. Because of the higher<br/>transmissivity of the highly porous Floridan aquifer, it is anticipated that the intergranular<br/>porosity component will play a large role in the overall flow field of the aquifer.<br/>Broader Impacts. This work should improve the understanding and<br/>management of karst aquifers that have significant portions of their flow within matrix<br/>porosity. These aquifers commonly represent major water resources, but have previously<br/>been managed using conceptual models that consider either flow primarily through<br/>conduits or treat the system as an equivalent porous medium. In particular, these results<br/>will be directly applicable to management of the Floridan aquifer and results will be<br/>disseminated to critical water managers through Martin's participation in the Florida<br/>Springs Task Force. Human resources will be impacted through graduate and<br/>undergraduate education, both formally as a resource for currently taught courses and<br/>through graduate student theses. One second-year PhD student is currently working on<br/>this topic as part of his dissertation, and two masters students and several undergraduates<br/>will participate in the field, laboratory, and analytical work.

The quantum mechanical property known as spin lies at the heart of many quantum information technologies. The spin of an electron, for example, can carry a quantum bit of information (known as a qubit), which takes the values 0 or 1, or a superposition of the two. Like an ordinary computer, the quantum computer performs operations on its qubits. This is accomplished by bringing the qubits (e.g. electrons) into proximity, and letting them interact over a prescribed time period. Typically, the interaction distances are very small, on the order of nanometers (one billionth of a meter). This distance requirement can cause communication problems for a quantum computer, which must access thousands of qubits. Indeed, in many architecture proposals, information must be transmitted to distant qubits by iterated swapping between neighboring spins in a one-dimensional array. There is considerable overhead associated with such swap protocols, both in time and efficiency. <br/>The present proposal puts forward a new concept for long-range, effective interactions between spin qubits, based on a spin-bus. The bus is formed from a long chain of closely spaced spins, which are fixed in place so that their interactions are constant and strong. The bus acts as a fast conduit for quantum information. Additional, external spin qubits can be coupled to the bus, by means of controlled electrical gates. Thus, the bus provides a mechanism for indirect qubits interactions at large distances. The spin-bus architecture has pros and cons that should be weighed and optimized. A particular advantage of the spin-bus approach is that it does not require any resources besides those normally assumed for spin quantum computing. Further, it intentionally exploits the most robust feature of spin-based architectures: strong coupling at short distances. <br/>The objective of the work is to characterize and develop all aspects of the spin-bus architecture for quantum computing. The proposal involves three separate and interdisciplinary research components: Bus Operation. A thorough understanding of the spin-bus energy spectrum is needed, to characterize the possible operating modes. Inevitable, inequivalent couplings between the neighboring spins reduce the bus speed. Theoretical analysis is needed, to determine the importance of such variability, and to optimize the bus operation in terms of bus size and speed. Decoherence Analysis. Quantum information is particularly susceptible to environmental influences, which lead to errors in the quantum computer. Because the spin-bus is much larger than a single spin, unique types of errors may affect it. Analysis will focus on fluctuating and spatially varying magnetic and electrostatic fields, vibrations within the matrix containing the spins, and leakage of information from the bus into undesired spin states. Quantum Error Correction. Error correction in the spin-bus is quite different from conventional quantum computers. The special challenges to be addressed include trade-offs between long-range coupling and parallelizability, leakage control, and the tailoring of established error correction techniques for the spin-bus architecture.

Advances in network theory and design, combined with strides in information theory and communication theory, have helped enable the deployment of multiterminal systems in which broadband information exchanges take place among fixed or mobile users over wired or wireless channels. In such systems, issues of secure communication have thrust themselves to the forefront of network operation, and of research in information theory. These developments emphasize the need for the study of network models of information security, which are of significantly greater scope and complexity than their point-to-point predecessors. The prime objective is to establish and maintain secure communication over public channels in networks of fixed or changing configuration.<br/>This investigation constitutes a new research area in information-theoretic cryptography, which focuses<br/>on code construction for secret key generation for encrypted communication in a network. The investigators<br/>study new constructive schemes for secret key generation, which are based on a provably secure notion of<br/>information theoretic secrecy. The main features of this research are: (i) the development of information theoretic principles which govern the modeling, quantitative performance assessment, and design of secret key cryptosystems for a network, with different secret keys being assigned to different groups of terminals for information security in group communication; (ii) an investigation of the relationship between information theoretic secrecy generation and distributed network data compression without secrecy constraints; and (iii) the resulting construction of secret keys from correlated observations at the terminals using new, practical constructions of linear data compression codes which, in turn, rely on families of emerging efficient linear error-correcting channel codes.

The performance of fuel cell electrodes depends strongly on the details of the electrodes' micro- or nano-structure. However, traditional methods for measuring material morphology (e.g. electron microscopy) are limited to two dimensions. The aim of the proposed project is to develop a powerful new method - focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy - for fully characterizing electrode microstructure in three dimensions. The new information available by this method will allow workers to connect performance and structure directly, enabling further advances in the technology. These new methods will be included in new university course materials and in educational modules designed to reach a broad spectrum of age groups. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: A main aim of this research is to fully understand the relationships between electrode processing, structure, properties, and performance. This will ultimately allow design of higher performance and more stable electrode microstructures, as well as providing processing information needed to achieve these structures. The methods developed are also of general interest to the engineering community. New course material based on this work will be integrated into the PI's existing courses on fuel cells at the University of Washington (UW). The 3D images will also facilitate demonstration of scientific principles to youths in unprecedented detail, and will become part of UW's yearly outreach to local area schools. This research is a collaborative effort with Northwestern University and the University of Michigan.

Female choice often favors exaggerated mating signals and is thereby expected to reduce genetic variation greatly, yet recent surveys indicate that substantial variation remains in many species. This problem has been addressed in an acoustic pyralid moth, the lesser wax moth (Achroia grisella), in which males broadcast an ultrasonic mating song attractive to females up to several meters distant. Playback experiments show that female lesser wax moths prefer male songs that are distinguished by several key features, and breeding experiments demonstrate substantial genetic variance, and heritability, for these song features. Additional breeding experiments and tests with inbred lines indicate that genetic tradeoffs between life history characters and male song attractiveness are not responsible for maintaining this variance. That is, attractive singers are larger, do not take longer to attain that size, survive longer, and spend more time singing on nightly and lifetime bases. On the other hand, environmental variation over space and time, combined with interactions between genotypes and the environment, may contribute to the genetic variance observed for male song attractiveness: Certain lines exhibit superior attractiveness when developing under a favorable environmental regime but show marked declines under stress, while other lines exhibit only modest performance in favorable environments but show little reduction in stress; that is, no one genetic variant exhibits the superior performance in all environments. However, these findings have thus far been restricted to observations of highly inbred or artificially selected laboratory populations, and the actual significance of environmental variation and genotype x environment interaction for maintaining genetic variance in natural populations is unknown. In this project researchers will extend the aforementioned studies in an important way by determining whether: (1) the range of responses to environmental gradients; and (2) the environmental variation that actually occur in the field are likely to maintain the levels of genetic variance observed for male song attractiveness. In particular, they will determine whether the level of genetic variance reflects the amount of environmental variation a population has experienced, and whether genetic variants that exhibit maximum attractiveness in both favorable and stressful environments occur. The two co-Principal Investigators will also determine whether variation in female preference for male signals, and the response of the female preference trait to environmental variation, contribute to genetic variance for male song attractiveness. This possibility will be augmented via a parallel molecular genetic (quantitative trait locus, QTL) analysis of inbred lines in which they will examine the covariance between genes that influence male song and female preference traits. Overall, the project emphasizes the complex interplay between genes and the environment that can shape animal behavior. The focus on GEI will help direct the attention of biologists toward more realistic studies of mating behavior and away from tendencies toward 'typological' thinking with regard to signals and preferences. The QTL analysis will represent one of the first applications of this powerful genetic tool for investigating the genetic bases of intra-specific differences in traits responsible for mate choice. In addition, the project will involve undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral scientists who will be trained in the study of acoustic communication and evolutionary genetics. Students attending the N.S.F. Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program offered during the summer by the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Kansas will do independent studies related to the proposed research. Moths from the various lines will be made available for laboratories in various undergraduate biology classes.

These nanomembranes will be exploited as a new platform for microscopic sensors and sensing arrays: thermal, acoustic, chemical, tactile, fluidic, and gas membrane microsensors. A clear understanding of the fundamentals of nanoscale interactions and structures important for the formation, responsive behavior, and functioning, will be crucial for the successful assembly of these flex nanomembranes. As a long-term goal, we envision embedded arrays of microscopic nanomembranes, which will be used as multifunctional arrays with an optical, an electrical, or a mechanical response. The principal molecular design includes a primary central sensing layer of inorganic nanoparticles sandwiched between two polymer multilayers, each 10-30 nm thick. The sensingnanolayer will include metal or semiconducting nano- spheres, platelets, rods, wires, shells, or tubes, exhibiting strong and detectable responsive behavior (e.g., changes in Raman spectra, conductivity, surface plasmon resonances, or luminescence). The polymeric multilayers will serve as anelastic supporting matrix as well as provide a tunable permeable wall which will control the access to the central layer. As a result of this project, we expect to fabricate a wide variety of robust, free-suspended nanomembranes with various sensing intra-layers and test their fundamental physical properties critical for sensing applications. Five PIs from Materials Science and Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering Departments of Iowa State University, University of Illinois, and University of Michigan, along with partners from five national labs/institutions and two European research institutions will join their efforts in NIRT collaborative activities. The team represents a truly interdisciplinary mix of chemists, physicists, materials scientists, chemical and electrical engineers with complementary expertises. The cross-disciplinary project will require the collaboration with partners from national labs (ANL, Ames Lab, ORNL, LLNL, and AFIT) assisting in advanced characterization and providing access to cutting-edge experimental facilities, unique experience for students, and vital feedback. International collaboration will be established with Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer Research, Germany and the Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. <br/><br/>A broader impact of the project is in enhancing student training and education in science and <br/>engineering and bringing advanced knowledge to national needs. Through intensive national and international collaborations, this project will enable Ph.D. students to become mature, internationally aware researchers familiar with cutting-edge research. In conjunction with the well established recruiting/retention programs at ISU like the Learn and Earn, Freshman Honors, BS/MS, and REU and the UROP program at UM, the PIs will continue their efforts to attract the number of young people pursuing advanced degrees in science and engineering, with a special emphasis on underrepresented groups. To address this, the PIs plan to establish a new sound initiative to attract younger women to science and engineering education in close collaboration with the Program for Women in Science and Engineering (PWSE) and the Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC). The NIRT team will establish the Summer Nanotechnology Boot Camp (SNBC) for summer PWSE interns that will incorporate active participation of NIRT graduate students. In the framework of this summer camp, up to ten high school female students will be involved in these activities under supervision of NIRT graduate students. They will <br/>prepare formal research presentations, which will be used in middle school science classes in Iowa. A key exciting element of this camp will be student participation in live, 3D virtual reality demonstrations of nano-assemblies. The new focus on enhancing diversity will be on the establishment of a new collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez (UPRM), a minority US institution. The NIRT team will establish a new summer visit-program with the UPRM to bring science and engineering bound minority undergraduate students to Iowa State campus. Finally, the NIRT industrial partnership will focus on knowledge transfer to small businesses (SB) with potentials for development of new sensor technologies. SB industrial partners include high-tech companies, Nomadics and Agiltron, which are already actively involved in membrane sensor technologies.

He will then apply this<br/>improved understanding to various questions in string theory,<br/>including joint work with Savdeep Sethi on the analysis of<br/>gravitational anomalies of field theories arising from string<br/>theories on singular spaces.<br/><br/>At low speeds and masses, general relativity should reduce to<br/>Newton's theory of gravity. This correspondence is confused by<br/>the fact that there is no definition of mass in general<br/>relativity which allows one to define the mass density at a<br/>single point in space. One can only define the mass of large<br/>regions. Physicists have introduced several notions of mass to<br/>obviate this difficulty, the best known of which is the ADM<br/>mass. The positive mass conjecture posits that this complicated<br/>ADM mass is never negative. This is important because a negative<br/>mass universe seems physically unreasonable. Moreover, the truth<br/>of the positive mass conjecture has strong implications for the<br/>very stability of space. In lower dimensions (including 4) this<br/>conjecture was proved by Schoen and Yau. Recent work in string<br/>theory has led to the study of gravity in more than 4 spacetime<br/>dimensions and thus interest in higher dimensional positive mass<br/>theorems under investigation in this project. Many related<br/>questions arising in the gravity theories produced by string<br/>theory are not currently amenable to careful mathematical<br/>analysis because the correct mathematical translation of some of<br/>the important string theory concepts, such as higher p form<br/>potentials, remains unclear. One of the goals of this project is<br/>to provide and apply such a translation.

The temperatures, pressures and lack of light all select for organisms that may not exist anywhere else on Earth. The accretion ice (lake water frozen to the bottom of the lower surface of the glacier) has preserved microbial samples from each region of Lake Vostok as the glacier passes over and into the lake. Thus, without contaminating the lake with microorganisms from the surface, microbes originating from the lake can be collected, transported to the laboratory and studied. Two of the deepest ice cores sections in this project are part of the international allocation. The will be shared between four researchers (Sergey Bulat from Russia, Jean-Robert Petit and Daniel Prieur from France, Scott Rogers from USA). The United States team will study, isolate, and characterize bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have been sampled from the lake through the process of ice accretion to the lower surface of 3500+m thick glacier overriding the lake. The project will involve a suite of methods, including molecular, morphological, and cultural. This includes observation and description by fluorescence, light, and electron microscopy, isolation on thirteen separate cultural media, polymerase chain reaction amplification, DNA sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses. Eleven accretion ice core sections, as well as two glacial ice core sections. As well as two glacial ice core sections will be studied. The accretion ice core sections, as well as two glacial ice core sections will be studied. The accretion ice core sections represent all of the major regions of the lake that have been sampled by the accretion process in the vicinity of the Vostok 5G ice core. The broader impacts of the work relate to the impact the results will have on the filed. These long=isolated lakes, deep below the Antarctic ice sheet may contain novel uniquely adapted organisms. Glacial ice contains an enormous diversity of entrapped microbes, some of which may be metabolically active in the ice. The microbes from Lake Vostok are of special interest, since they are adapted to cold, dark, and high pressure. Thus, their enzyme systems and biochemical pathways may be significantly different from those in the microbes that are the subject of current studies. As such, these organisms may form compounds that may have useful applications. Also, study of the accretion ice, and eventually the water, from Lake Vostok will provide a basis for the study of other subglacial lakes. Additionally, study of the microbes in the accretion ice will be useful to those planning to study analogous systems on ice-covered planets and moons.

0522637	The Nature and Function of Causal Thinking, Fall 2005; California Institute of Technology	SES	Hist & Philosophy of SET	08/01/2005	07/27/2005	James Woodward	CA	California Institute of Technology	Standard Grant	Frederick M Kronz	07/31/2006	$10,000.00	Christopher Hitchcock	jfw@hss.caltech.edu	1200 E California Blvd	PASADENA	CA	911250600	6263956219	SBE	1353	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Funding is requested for a workshop on The Origins and Functions of Causal Thinking to be held at the California Institute of Technology in Fall, 2005. This workshop will be the second in a series of international workshops on the topic, and will focus on the connection between causation, agency, and intervention.<br/> Intellectual Merit.<br/> The workshop will bring together an international body of scholars from different disciplines, including philosophy, cognitive psychology,developmental psychology, primatology, and artificial intelligence to explore issues having to do with the structure, functions and origins of causal concepts and reasoning. The rationale for the workshop is that there are rapidly growing bodies of research in all of these disciplines that address common themes, but which have proceeded in isolation from one another. Researchers in all of these areas would benefit from more cross -disciplinary fertilization. Within philosophy, interventionist or agency oriented approaches show promise as accounts of causation as this notion figures in everyday life and in the social and biomedical sciences, but it is also unclear to what extent such approaches can be extended to cover causal notions as they figure in fundamental physics, and what follows for our understanding of the notion of causation and its place in human life if they cannot. Empirical studies of causal learning in children, adults and non-human primates suggest that the human ability to learn from interventions, as well as our ability to combine such with information obtained from passive observation, is central to human causal cognition and to what distinguishes this from the abilities of non-human animals. For all of these reasons a conference devoted to the exploration of issues related to the connections between causation, agency and intervention will have a very large intellectual pay-off and should help to shape future work in this interdisciplinary field in important ways.<br/><br/> Broader Impact. <br/><br/>Many of the participants in the workshop will be women. The<br/>workshop will be open to all interested researchers and the results will be made available to a wider public in the form of an edited volume entitled, The Origins and Functions of Causal Thinking. More generally, a better understanding of the nature of causal reasoning in humans, of the purposes to which causal reasoning is put, and of the nature of causation itself, may ultimately help to enhance people's ability to engage in causal reasoning. Current evidence suggests that people are in fact very good at learning about causal relationships among phenomena that they can directly observe or control. At the same<br/>time people are often very bad judges of causal relationships when presented with information in a more abstract form (such as of statistical data). A better understanding o fhow people reason about causation might be used to improve educational practice in disciplines (including any area of science) that focus on the provision of specific kinds of causal understanding. Moreover, citizens in a participatory democracy are often required to pass judgment on competing policy proposals. Doing so requires an understanding of the way in which the implementation of a new policy constitutes an intervention in existing causal structures, and of what the effects of such a disruption will be. An enhanced understanding of causal reasoning may enable us to better educate citizens on policy issues and enable them to make decisions that are better informed.

0515431	REVSYS: Phylogenetic, Biogeographic, and Revisionary Taxonomic Studies in Prunus (Rosaceae)	DEB	Advanc Revisionary Taxon & Sys	07/15/2005	05/14/2009	Daniel Potter	CA	University of California-Davis	Continuing grant	Susan L. Perkins	06/30/2010	$500,000.00		dpotter@ucdavis.edu	OR/Sponsored Programs	Davis	CA	956186134	5307547700	BIO	7375	1171, 7375, 9169, EGCH	$0.00	The plant genus Prunus (subfamily Amygdaloideae of family Rosaceae) comprises roughly 200 species of trees and shrubs and includes many of the most economically important fruit and nut crops of temperate regions, such as plums/prunes, peaches, cherries, and almonds, as well as many ornamental species and numerous wild species of ethnobotanical importance because of their uses for food, timber, and medicine. Species of Prunus exhibit great morphological diversity of vegetative and reproductive structures. The genus is distributed throughout the north temperate regions of the world and also includes representatives in tropical regions of Asia and America. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies across Rosaceae and within Prunus have raised questions about the traditional circumscription of subfamily Amygdaloideae and have suggested that a revised classification for Prunus is needed. Moreover, species delimitation throughout Prunus is notoriously poorly understood, and no previous systematic study has included adequate representation of the Pygeum group, a group of about 40 species of the Old World tropics. This project is a comprehensive systematic study of Prunus, the specific objectives of which are: 1) to increase collections of herbarium specimens and material for DNA extractions of 60-80 species of Prunus from tropical Asia and America; 2) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships across Prunus based on nucleotide sequence data from several regions of the nuclear and chloroplast genomes, while also helping to resolve the relationship of Prunus to other genera in Rosaceae; 3) to examine the evolution of morphological characters within the phylogenetic framework; 4) to infer the historical biogeography of Prunus and to compare it to several other well-supported clades within Rosaceae with distributions in the Old and New Worlds in order to assess whether or not there are recurrent biogeographic patterns in the family; 5) to propose a new phylogenetically based infrageneric classification for Prunus; and 6) to revise the taxonomy of the 50-60 tropical Asian species of Prunus, including all species currently classified in the Pygeum group. The project, a collaborative effort coordinated by Dr. Dan Potter (University of California-Davis) with colleagues Dr. Jun Wen (Smithsonian Institution) and Dr. Joey Shaw (University of Tennessee - Chattanooga), will provide a rigorous modern systematic study and new taxonomic treatments for a large, taxonomically complex and economically important genus of flowering plants performed by a team of researchers with complementary expertise and extensive experience with the group. <br/>The project's broader impacts include its relevance to germplasm conservation in this economically important group, training of a Southeast Asian graduate student and a U.S. postdoctoral fellow, and development of a short course in molecular systematics to be offered by the investigators at Herbarium Bogoriense in Indonesia. Results of the project will be disseminated via scientific publications and through internet databases and websites, including contributions to GenBank, detailed taxonomic information for other botanists, and materials on Prunus evolution and systematics intended for educators, students, and horticulturists. Data generated by these studies will be valuable to an international consortium of plant geneticists who are developing peach, Prunus persica, as a model for genomic studies in Rosaceae.

These earthquakes accommodate the relative<br/>motion between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates along a fault that is mostly off<br/>shore, but may extend onshore in places such as the Olympic Peninsula. It has been<br/>recently discovered that much, if not all, of the slip along the portion of the plate<br/>boundary just down dip (east) of the megathrust earthquake zone is accommodated by<br/>episodic tremor and slip (ETS) events that occur every 14 months in the regions from the<br/>Olympic Peninsula north into Vancouver Island. We propose to deploy arrays of seismometers and Global Positioning System instrumentation in order to record and better characterize the next ETS event which is expected to occur sometime in August, September or October, 2005.
0518753	The Canonical Type Space for Interdependent Preferences	SES	ECONOMICS	08/01/2005	05/09/2007	Faruk Gul	NJ	Princeton University	Continuing grant	Daniel H. Newlon	07/31/2008	$162,582.00		fgul@princeton.edu	Off. of Research & Proj. Admin.	Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	SBE	1320	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This award will fund two research projects. Both of these projects will be undertaken jointly with Wolfgang Pesendorfer of Princeton University.<br/><br/>Recent research in behavioral and experimental economics emphasizes the importance of incorporating<br/>psychological factors into standard economic models. What distinguishes such factors from those normally included in economic models is the fact that the former cannot be accounted for as a part of the description of consequences. The first research project will create and analyze a model of interdependent preferences that will allow for the construction of economic models in which individuals have concerns about the personalities of others. This model will (i) facilitate the analysis of existing experimental evidence showing that individuals' willingness to share rewards depends on the personality of the person with whom the rewards are to be shared, (ii) suggest additional applications, and (iii) provide alternative foundations for Harsanyi's notion of a type. <br/><br/>Preliminary results have included analyzing the effects of altruism, reciprocity and a desire to conform<br/>to (or violate) social standards. The two theorems already proven establish the existence and uniqueness of the canonical space of interdependent preference types and show that each type in that space can be interpreted as a pair consisting of a characteristic and a personality. Future research will focus on (i) developing extension that incorporate both interdependent preferences and asymmetric information, (ii) understanding the relationship between the current model and those that model interdependent preferences through beliefs, and (iii) applications. The broader impact of this project will be to identify new factors that influence behavior and to develop more descriptive models of social interaction.<br/><br/>The second project is an analysis of electoral competition. Standard Downsian analysis yields models of political competition supporting the conclusion that candidates' policy choices and election outcomes will reflect median-voter preferences even if a significant fraction of the voters are uninformed. Evidence from<br/>U.S. elections often fails to support this conclusion. So far, this research has established that standard Downsian outcomes can be overturned if (i) some fraction of the voters are uninformed of both the policy choice of one candidate and of the distribution of preferences, (ii) voters have some small preference for the personality of one or other candidate, and (iii) the candidate knows the distribution of preferences. In a model with one strategic candidate, it has been shown that a candidate mostly concerned with getting elected facing an almost fully uninformed electorate never chooses the median preferred policy but gets elected whenever the majority prefers his personality. In contrast, a candidate who is mostly concerned with policy, always chooses the median preferred policy but never gets elected. Future research will focus on extending the analysis to models where multiple candidates make policy decisions and to apply the resulting models to problems in auction theory and corporate governnance. The intellectual merit of this project is in establishing the possibility of partisan politics (i.e., the candidate's failure to adopt median preferred policies), aggregation failure (i.e., voters' rejection of median preferred policies), and in showing that seemingly naive behavior (voting based on personality preferences) can be sustained in equilibrium even when agents are fully rational. <br/>and care little about personalities.<br/>The broader impact of this project is to (i) assess the e.ectiveness and limitations of instrumental<br/>voting models and (ii) understand the e.ectiveness of democratic systems in information<br/>aggregation and in determining socially desirable policy outcomes.<br/>1

0503969	RUI: Botanical and Geographical Sourcing of Pine Tar by Component Analysis: A Step Towards Documenting the Tar Trade	BCS	ARCHAEOMETRY	08/01/2005	07/29/2005	Curt Beck	NY	Vassar College	Standard Grant	John E. Yellen	07/31/2008	$37,977.00	Edith Stout	beck@vassar.edu	124 Raymond Avenue	Poughkeepsie	NY	126040657	8454377092	SBE	1393	9278, EGCH	$0.00	With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Curt W. Beck and his group at Vassar College, including undergraduate students, will conduct a comprehensive chemical analysis of multiple samples of resins collected from each of the 13 species of pine endemic to Europe and North Africa, as well as of pine tars made from these resins at various temperatures. The species will be authenticated by an international team of botanists and foresters from all the countries concerned.<br/><br/>The rapid growth of underwater archaeology has brought to light large numbers of specimens of resins and tars from shipwrecks, ranging in time over 3000 years. They are found in amphoras once containing resinated wine, in the caulking of the ships, in the lining of transport amphoras, and as cargo. Most of these resins and tars can be identified as derived from the pine genus, but the customary analysis for high-molecular-weight resin acids does not identify the species of pines and thus their geographical origin.<br/><br/>Recent work at Vassar College, using gas chromatography (GC) to separate the components, mass spectrometry (MS) to identify them, and specific ion monitoring (SIM) to enhance the sensitivity, has shown that the resin of the Aleppo pine, which is the dominant pine species in the Mediterranean, contains traces of the low-molecular-weight compound methyl benzoate, and that this characteristic constituent survives in archaeological tars that have been exposed to high temperatures. This compound is not present in the resins and tars derived from the Scots pine of Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe. The work proposed will establish whether this biomarker is unique to the Aleppo pine, and what other trace constituents can permit the identification of individual pine species or of geographically specific groups of species,<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the chemical characterization of the European pines is to provide a fact-based method of distinguishing archaeological tars of Southern Europe that were made locally from those that were imported. The data obtained will also constitute a substantial contribution to the biochemical genetics of the genus pine.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the work will be a better understanding of a central question in European archaeology, - the 'barbarian-civilized' relations between transalpine and Mediterranean cultures. These relations have long been evident in Mediterranean durable goods that were traded north, but our knowledge of what may have been traded in exchange has so far been limited to Baltic amber. Proof of tar trade will add significantly to our knowledge of commercial and cultural contacts throughout prehistory. Furthermore, the volume of tar trade in different prehistoric and early historic periods will test current views about the anthropogenic deforestation of the Mediterranean, since increases in the volume of imports would indicate shortfalls of local sources of tar. <br/><br/>The work involves undergraduate students in research of archaeological and anthropological significance while introducing them to research methodologies and techniques that are used in all of the natural and social sciences.

This is an essential part of a broad effort to maximize the scientific return at the high energy frontier. The LHC will commence operation in 2007, opening a new regime in particle physics up to and beyond the TeV energy scale. The unprecedented energy range and luminosity of this new accelerator are expected to lead to discoveries of new elementary particles and novel behaviors of the fundamental forces. Such discoveries at the smallest distance scales could have revolutionary effects on our understanding of the unification of forces, the origin and stability of matter, the ultimate underpinnings of the observable universe, and the nature of space-time itself. <br/><br/>U.S. physicists, who constitute approximately 23% of collaborating LHC scientists, are mostly based at U.S. universities. This fact underlies the basis of this proposal, namely that in order to fully exploit the ambitious and rich scientific program at the LHC, researchers at U.S. universities must have the necessary resources required for full participation in all phases of the scientific program. This opportunity brings with it ongoing responsibilities: to ensure that the detectors developed and constructed by U.S. CMS physicists function and are maintained at full capability and that the data are acquired efficiently and made available for analysis by the U.S. members of the CMS collaboration. A partnership of universities and laboratories is sharing the development of Data Grids to provide a comprehensive framework for collaborative research and training, supporting coordinated data analysis on an unprecedented scale at facilities at many locations in the U.S. and around the world. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the research includes advances in technology, support for university scientific infrastructure, and the opportunity to attract students and the public to exciting frontier science. Numerous outreach possibilities exist which are already being implemented in programs such as QuarkNet. Extensive computer networks are being built as collaborative tools for the LHC, and they can also be used to share the excitement of discovery with non-collaborators.

The accessories will include a double-resonance, magic angle spinning (MAS) probe, which is essential for many solid state NMR spectroscopic applications, as well as a single-resonance CRAMPS (Combined Rotation and Multiple Pulse Sequence) probe for solid state NMR spectroscopy of the 1H nucleus. This requested instrumentation will provide greatly improved solid state NMR spectroscopic capabilities for studying a wide range samples, hence advancing the interdisciplinary materials research being conducted in a broad range of departments at Northwestern University (NU). Research programs which would immediately benefit from incisive condensed matter NMR characterization capabilities include those studying novel transition metal reagents for organic synthesis, novel opto-electronically active solids for optical communications, data storage, and organic transistors, metal-organic frameworks for efficient energy storage and catalysis, silicon-based cage structures and nanocapsules having unusual architectures, graphene nanoplatelets and carbon nanorods for solid state electronics and high-strength materials, novel structural and barrier polymers, and solid state natural materials such as resins and gums from plant exudates. The more sensitive one- and two-dimensional solid state NMR spectroscopy at ambient and variable temperatures offered by this new instrument will significantly enable far more definitive structural characterization of these materials, leading to a more detailed understanding of their functionality. The ability to conduct these studies in-house with high throughput and rapid feedback will not only allow NU materials research to move forward more expeditiously, but will also provide a more complete educational experience for graduate students who will learn modern solid state NMR spectroscopic techniques in a hands-on manner while applying it to their own research. Additionally, advanced undergraduate courses in the Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Materials Science and Engineering programs at NU will introduce experiments with this instrumentation. These educational benefits will spread far beyond NU as graduate and undergraduate students move on to other positions.<br/><br/><br/>Modern Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an extremely powerful technique for understanding the structure and function of solid materials. Funds from this proposal will be used to acquire a state-of-the-art spectrometer for use by a broad community of materials research scientists and their students at Northwestern University. Interdisciplinary research being conducted in many departments will benefit from the structural characterization capabilities offered by the proposed instrument and not currently available to us. The data from this instrument will lead to a better understanding of a wide range of solid state materials currently under study and which are important to the development of more selective, efficient, and environmentally friendly catalytic processes, new materials for energy storage, opto-electronic materials for high-speed communications, data storage, and printed transistors, and stronger, lighter weight structural materials. This requested instrument will also play a major role in educational programs for our graduate and undergraduate students.

Specifically, we propose purchase of a PHOIBOS 100 hemispherical analyzer for charged particles (designed to work for XPS, AES, UPS, SAM, and ISS) and electron, X-ray, and UV sources from SPECS. The PHOIBOS 100 analyzer will allow us to study areas as small as 200 mm and carry out angle resolved and spatial resolved XPS and AES measurements. Since it has the possibility of working in multi channeltron mode (up to 9) this unit has very good energy resolution, 200 kcps @ 0.85 eV FWHM for Ag3d5/2 and 300 W Mg Ka in XPS mode and ultra high resolution of 4.4 meV on Ar 3p1/2 in UPS mode (He excitation). The PHOIBOS 100 analyzer, in combination with Scanning Electron gun (model EQ22/35), X-Ray Source (model XR-50), Ultraviolet Source (model UVS 10/35), and differentially pumped small-spot ion-gun (model IQE 12/38) will significantly expand our existing Molecular Beam Epitaxy system capability and will help us resolve important issues in understanding the correlations between chemical, structural and dynamic magnetic properties in multi-layered structures. In particular, we will investigate a series of problems which require very careful characterization of the chemical state of (mostly magnetic) elements at interfaces. For example, recently we have found that the rotational anisotropy in exchange bias systems (Fe/MnF2 and Fe/KNiF3) exhibit significantly different strength along the easy and hard axes of Fe ultrathin films. To understand the nature of this new effect we need to investigate the interaction between Fe atoms at the interface and antiferromagnets (MnF2 or KNiF3). The XPS technique is indispensable for such studies. Another interesting problem we would like to study is mixed valency of Eu atoms at the surface of the ultrathin EuF3 films and different Eu intermetallic compounds. This new instrumentation will significantly expand our research and teaching capabilities allowing us, together with students, to attack intriguing and important scientific problems.<br/><br/><br/>The purchase of electron spectroscopy components for surface and thin film physics will significantly strengthen our teaching, basic research, and interaction between our department and local industry. The educational impact of this equipment on students is integrated in student participation in research as well as in specific courses such as advanced laboratory classes. Our laboratory offers a special opportunity for both undergraduate and graduate (M.S.) student training. By gaining laboratory expertise in both synthesis and measurements of thin films, students trained in our research group are well positioned to pursue careers in academia and in the Colorado semiconductor and magnetic storage industries. The proposed equipment will complement our existing facilities by allowing us to perform chemical characterization of materials along with the existing structural, magnetic and electrical characterization capabilities. Furthermore, we will be able to explore exciting issues of basic research such as understanding the correlations between chemical, structural and dynamic magnetic properties in multi-layered structures. In particular, we will investigate a series of problems which require very careful characterization of the chemical state of (mostly magnetic) elements at interfaces. Finally, this new equipment will allow us to collaborate more with small local R&D companies and help them to solve problems related to surface physics.

Using theoretical models constrained by geologic and petrologic observations, they will examine the basic behavior of systems undergoing melting and their predictions. The research will primarily be undertaken by a graduate student, with close supervision by the PIs in a staged manner, progressing from simple to more complex (realistic) models. It is expected that the new models can be used to test emerging ideas and observations of chemical heterogeneity in melts and mantle residues in a variety of melting regimes (ridges, arc, plumes).
0521674	MRI: Acquisition of Instruments to Establish a Capability in Nanoimprinting of New Materials	ECCS	MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION	08/01/2005	07/21/2005	Albert Yee	CA	University of California-Irvine	Standard Grant	Radhakisan S.

The instrument will be used by about a dozen researchers at University of California, Irvine (UCI) and elsewhere. Conventional photolithographic techniques for fabricating nanostructures are limited to feature sizes larger than 50 nm. Higher resolution techniques exist but have extremely low throughput and are therefore impractical for large-scale production. Nanoimprinting of polymers is a new technique for fabricating nanostructures that has been further developed and refined by the PI and his colleagues on the laboratory scale, producing nanostructures on a silicon wafer roughly 0.5 in diameter. The new instrument will be adapted to enable nanoimprinting of polymers using the techniques developed by the PI on 4 wafers in minutes.<br/><br/>The enhanced nanofabrication capabilities will attract industrial users as well as university researchers, thus providing opportunities for UCI students to interact with a broader spectrum of researchers. UCI already has a track record in working with industries (~ 45 companies) through its clean room facility. These industrial users will have access to the nanoimprinter. For students, this equipment also extends the university's capabilities into a new arena. Approximately 25 graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the use of this machine in the first year, and a larger number will be exposed to its usefulness through classroom projects and lectures. The acquisition of the nanoimprinter will significantly impact the teaching and development of courses on nanotechnologies, microfluidics, stamp lithography,.and micro- and nano-technology for biomedical applications.

They will develop a large-volume atmospheric archive at the margin of the Greenland ice sheet in order to test two competing hypotheses for the cause of the abrupt increases in atmospheric methane concentration that punctuated the last glacial period. The main objective is to measure the carbon-14 (14C) content of atmospheric methane before and after these events. These events have been attributed to 1) destabilization of sedimentary methane hydrate (clathrate) or 2) increased methane production in terrestrial wetlands due to warmer and wetter climatic conditions. The carbon-14 content of atmospheric methane should distinguish between clathrate and wetland sources because clathrates are made from carbon-14-free sedimentary organic matter, whereas the carbon-14 content of wetland-derived methane is essentially the same as that of atmospheric carbon dioxide. This test is important because the wetland hypothesis has been used to infer large-scale tropical abrupt climate change, with broad implications for our understanding of the potential for rapid change in both past and future climates. The main obstacle to this measurement is that it requires ~200 liters of air, much more than is available from ice core samples. This work will use ice that outcrops due to ablation and ice flow at the margin of the Greenland ice sheet at a location called Pakitsoq, enabling virtually unlimited sample size. Preliminary fieldwork has demonstrated that ice of the appropriate age (11,000-15,000 years ago) can be found, and that it is not contaminated with respect to methane or gas isotopes, by comparison with the known atmospheric record from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice core. Ice of Eemian (last Interglacial) age also appears to be present at this site, and this work will use gas measurements to establish the chronology of the entire margin ice section including a thick Holocene section.

This research will examine the cognitive processes that support bilinguals' ability to correctly choose the language in which they intend to speak. Much of the current research on spoken production in bilinguals has focused on bilinguals whose two languages share the same Roman alphabet. For these bilinguals, the evidence suggests that both languages are active even when the individual intends to speak one language alone. The question in the present research is whether the same parallel activity of the two languages will be observed for bilinguals whose two languages do not share the same script. In a series of six experiments, this issue will be examined by comparing the performance of Japanese-English and Spanish-English bilinguals on three spoken production tasks. One set of experiments uses a speeded picture-naming task to ask whether the phonological facilitation typically observed for same-script bilinguals when pictures have cognate names across languages will also be observed for different-script bilinguals. A second set of experiments investigates the magnitude of interference in picture naming when distractor words in the bilinguals' native language are presented during picture naming in the second language. A third set of experiments examines language switching performance for these two groups of bilinguals. Across the planned experiments, the performance of speakers from these two groups will be compared for bilinguals living in a native-language context vs. those immersed in a second language environment. An additional set of language-independent measures will assess the degree to which the results of these experiments are affected by individual differences in the ability to allocate cognitive resources in planning spoken utterances.<br/><br/>This research project has a number of broader implications. It will contribute important foundational knowledge about multilingualism that will inform educational issues in a society in which many learners are faced with the task of acquiring a second language past the earliest stages of childhood. The focus in the proposed research on the linguistic and cognitive factors that influence speech planning will provide crucial new information about how skilled oral proficiency in a second language is accomplished. The research will also contribute to the training of an increasingly diverse group of cognitive scientists by including undergraduate students, many of whom are bilingual themselves, and will foster international scientific collaboration.

At the core, this technology relies fundamentally on approximating analog signals of the real world by discrete representations that can be stored, transmitted and processed without loss of information by digital circuits and computers. Despite the ubiquity of applications and products that process signals digitally, the interface between the analog and the digital worlds, i.e. the quantization paradigm, is still only partially understood from a fundamental point of view. While the classical approach of high-resolution discretization of independent signal samples has remained dominant in the theory, the actual technology has evolved in a completely different direction in which highly correlated signal samples are quantized very coarsely using as few as 1 bit per sample. Everyday technological products such as CD players, cell phones and laser printers have employed this alternative approach very successfully for over a decade already, yet the current theoretical understanding of coarsely quantized overcomplete expansions is still highly underdeveloped. The goal of this project is to set forth the theoretical foundations of this subject with the motivations of better analyzing existing methods, introducing new designs and creating new potential applications by extending the concept to other areas of signal processing.<br/><br/>Two specific and related methods for coarse quantization of redundant (overcomplete) signal expansions are sigma-delta modulation for A/D conversion of audio signals and error-diffusion for digital halftoning of images. In both cases, a given target analog signal is represented by a judiciously chosen one-bit (or few-bit) sequence which approximates the signal in a suitable low-pass subspace. Both methods employ specially designed nonlinear feedback dynamical systems to generate these representations, exact analyses of which are very challenging. Central questions of input-output error signal analysis -- a somewhat alien subject to dynamical systems -- have been traditionally addressed via empirical linear modeling. This research introduces radically new tools of analysis and design by incorporating dynamical systems and signal processing methods through a genuine study of the nonlinearity. A secondary contribution is the development of new signal processing applications in communications theory inspired by coarse quantization ideas in redundant systems.

Most work on the topic has located statistics as a tool of the state and shown how this tool is used to enhance the rationalization of the nation-state and to invent society. This study shows this is happening, but also demonstrates the reverse: how statistics constitutes itself through the state. Paradoxically, the study shows how state creation of a bureau of statistics contributed to development of a statistical scientific community that tried to dissociate itself from politics. The goal of the proposed research is to describe the emergence of official statistics as intertwined with the consolidation of the nation-state, and with the construction of official statistics as an objective body of knowledge. Since statistical practices not only reflect political processes, the project seeks to understand how different statistical styles and strategies helped shape power relations in both societies. The project will compare how state building in Canada in the early 20th century, and in Israel, before and after establishment of the state in 1948, have shaped national statistics and how they were applied. The comparison is based on the fact that both countries are post-colonial societies that were once part of the British Empire, and both have a history of conflict between major ethnic and national groups. Their status as erstwhile British colonies has resulted in resemblances in institutional characteristics and how scientific practices were employed. This study will focus on the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, Canada, and in Israel, the Central Bureau of Statistics.  <br/><br/>Intellectual Merits<br/>Treating these bureaus as objects of inquiry can contribute to the Science and Technology Studies literature in several ways.  STS has reconceptualized universality as the result of successfully extending local socio-technical constructions rather than as discovery of a priori conditions. Analysis of a central bureau of national statistics is a study of a local institution that extends its knowledge, political, economic and demographic, and its epistemological infrastructure, beyond national boundaries. By applying STS tools to examine the intersection between science and the state, this project will illustrate that the  relationship is not merely one of dependence on the government, but also a source of state legitimacy and a basis of public action.  Since the Canadian census became a model for Israel, the study show that the flow of knowledge and methods was not mainly between metropolis and colony but also around the periphery, as different states and territories tried to come to terms with similar problems of knowledge and administration. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The broader impact of this study is in its ambition to comprehend the political impact of different epistemological tools, mainly statistical, in shaping state policies towards minorities. Assuming that the Canadian model of dealing with ethnic conflicts was more successful than the Israeli, that would mark the differences between the two countries in developing national statistics and could help explain why the Canadian model of dealing with ethnic conflicts differs from the Israeli one. This project will illustrate that statistical knowledge and practices have the power to institutionalize and deepen ethnic conflicts, as has happened in the Israeli, or to moderate them, as perhaps in the Canadian case.<br/>

Among the applications are<br/>the efficient, stable, high-order computation of traveling<br/>three-dimensional, capillary-gravity water waves, and a numerical<br/>investigation of their dynamic stability. Another problem the PI will<br/>address is the imposition of non-reflecting boundary conditions for<br/>differential equations posed on unbounded domains, particularly in the<br/>setting of electromagnetic and acoustic scattering. The PI also<br/>proposes a synthesis of two major areas of his research through the<br/>study of backscattering returns of electromagnetic radiation from<br/>traveling ocean waves. A unifying element in this project, and the<br/>principal numerical tool the PI will employ, is a class of boundary<br/>perturbation methods first introduced by O. Bruno & F. Reitich in the<br/>context of numerical simulation of acoustic and electromagnetic<br/>scattering problems. These methods have subsequently been<br/>significantly refined and stabilized by Reitich and the PI for the BVP<br/>of computing Dirichlet-Neumann operators, and approximating scattering<br/>configurations. Among these refinements, the PI & Reitich developed<br/>the method of Transformed Field Expansions (TFE) which enables the<br/>reliable, high-order, stable perturbative computation of BVP and FBP.<br/>While this method is extremely successful in resolving simulations<br/>well outside the reach of competing methods, it is somewhat<br/>disadvantaged in terms of computational complexity in comparison to<br/>other techniques (e.g. boundary integrals/elements). A final project<br/>that the PI proposes is the investigation of two refinements of this<br/>TFE approach to increase its efficiency.<br/><br/>Fixed and free boundary problems arise in all areas of engineering and<br/>the sciences. Two particular instances of relevance in this proposal<br/>are the classic free boundary problem of the motion of surface waves<br/>on a large body of water (e.g. a lake, sea, or ocean), and the fixed<br/>boundary problem of scattering of electromagnetic or acoustic waves<br/>from an irregular surface. The accurate and reliable simulation of<br/>surface waves is used not only to model the capabilities of open-ocean<br/>structures (e.g. oil platforms), but also in the study of transport of<br/>pollutants and other substances of environmental interest across<br/>lakes, seas, and oceans. Applications of electromagnetic and acoustic<br/>scattering come in problems of radar, imaging, and sensing to name<br/>just a few. Many numerical techniques are available for the<br/>simulation of these problems and one of the goals of this proposal is<br/>the utilization and improvement of a class of techniques discovered<br/>and refined by the Principal Investigator (PI) and collaborators. In<br/>particular, when the problems mentioned above are simulated in full<br/>three dimensions, the computations become quite intensive and the<br/>issues truly become those of high-performance computing.

The conference will assemble an international group of scientists whose collective goal is to understand how the genome is packaged and how this packaging impacts nuclear processes, especially the regulation of gene expression. One key objective of this FASEB conference series has been to bring together researchers who study transcription factors with those that study chromatin structure. This conference also takes a lead in championing genetic studies as well as those of nuclear structure, chromosome organization, chromosome behavior and maintenance, and, more recently, RNA-mediated mechanisms of gene regulation. Sessions will focus on nucleosome structure and histone modifications, DNA replication and chromatin assembly, active chromatin, repressed chromatin, the inheritance of chromatin states, differentiation and disease, genome-wide control, and higher-order organization. There are also two broader impact goals of the conference: to support the efforts of young investigators to launch independent careers, and to incorporate researchers from diverse backgrounds.

GIS is a discipline that endeavors to spatially analyze, study, and critically research aspects of our world with the use of innovative tools and techniques that organize and display large amounts of site-specific data.  Because San Diego County is home to a large number of companies that utilize GIS Technology, a significant need exists within the workforce of the County for personnel trained in the theory and use of GIS software and hardware, particularly for spatial analysis applications. <br/><br/>The GIS Technology program is promoting the intellectual development of a community of learners in desperate need. Incorporation of real-world, discipline related critical topics and GIS industrial standards into existing courses, and the implementation of four new courses is at the core of the program. Using state-of-the-art hardware and software, the project is also conducting the following activities: 1) Professional development workshops for college and high school faculty; 2) Placement of students in undergraduate research projects and baccalaureate programs; 3) Placement of students in professional, paid internships; and 4) GIS training for professionals in need. The GIS Technology program is a collaborative effort among faculty from disciplinary divisions across the campus. <br/><br/>With a student enrollment of greater than 80% ethnic minorities, this project is also making a significant contribution to bringing marketable GIS skills to underrepresented students. <br/>
0510293	Collaborative Research: Syncollisional Delamination: A Test of Crustal-scale Tectonic Wedging Exposed in the Avalon Terrane of New England	EAR	TECTONICS	07/01/2005	04/12/2007	Robert Wintsch	IN	Indiana University	Continuing grant	David Fountain	06/30/2009	$173,314.00		wintsch@indiana.edu	509 E 3RD ST	Bloomington	IN	474013654	8128550516	GEO	1572	0000, OTHR	$0.00	One outstanding problem in tectonics is the mechanism of crustal thickening. Where tectonic plates converge, relatively low density crust may become delaminated from its denser mantle keel, or slices of felsic crust may indent or interfinger as crustal wedges. In this case indenting or even mutually indenting structures may lead to thickened crust. The structure of tectonic wedging has received increasing support from the interpretations of geophysical data, but interpenetrating crustal slivers have rarely been observed in the field. Consequently the mechanisms and even the confirmation of interpenetrating wedges remain speculative.<br/><br/>In this collaboration between Indiana University and Brigham Young University geologists are making one of the first attempts to directly characterize and identify the causes of syn-collisional wedging of upper crust from lower crust using surface outcrop. They have discovered an example of tectonic wedging in a tilted lower crustal profile. The outcrops in coastal Connecticut exposure rocks formerly mapped as fold nappes within the Avalon terrane. In addition to Avalonian rocks derived from juvenile sources, our pilot study of neodymium and lead isotopes is showing that the structurally lowest orthogneisses is derived from ancient crustal rocks that correlate with the Gander terrane. Their work in this region shows that Avalonian rocks both overlie Gander basement rocks and underlie rocks known to the north to rest conformably over Gander basement. Thus this map pattern defines the geometry of a tectonic wedge. <br/><br/>The goals of the project are (1) to confirm the identity and correlation of Avalon and Gander zone rocks in southern coastal New England with correlative rocks in maritime Canada where they are well characterized, (2) to test the extent and distribution of Avalon and Gander zone rocks in other inliers of New England, (3) to test single vs. double indenting models, (4) to monitor the timing and rate of approach of Avalon in the cover terranes by establishing the time of quenching of the cover Gander terranes, and (5) to assess the rheology of the rocks in the terrane boundary. Methods to be used include characterization of outcrop in the field, analysis of major and trace element compositions to identify intrusive igneous rocks, and neodymium and lead isotopic analysis of theses igneous rocks to ascertain the origins of the initial magmas.

The approach consists in coating individual carbon nanotubes with a chemically inert sheath, then exposing the nanotube tip. Selective growth of a particle at the tip will follow utilizing gaseous precursors with enhanced reactivity towards carbon. The intimate tube-particle contact allows the particle to be used for sensing at the nanoscale when the nanotube is integrated on a scanning probe. The particle offers a larger area for the attachment of functional sensing molecules to increase sensitivity and allows chemistries, other than carbon-based, to be explored for anchoring. Functionalized nanoelectrodes can trigger and probe signaling pathways in cells or in electrophysiological fluids. Massive fabrication of nanotube-nanoparticle half-dumbbells bears promise for self-assembly at the nanoscale utilizing magnetic and/or hydrophobic-hydrophilic interactions. Such assemblies may lead to new functionalities and materials properties.<br/><br/> The broader impact of the proposed research emerges from the ability to image and manipulate matter at the nanoscale. Nanoelectrodes can help improve understanding of signaling in biosystems ultimately connected with life and health. More sensitive nanoelectrodes can help detect more efficiently minute amounts of toxic or polluting chemicals of environmental importance. Nanotube-nanoparticle dumbbells will provide new building blocks for assembling new materials with improved structural, magnetic, electronic, and photonic properties. Nanotubes coupled to silicon quantum dots may increase the efficiency of solar energy conversion. Finally, nanotube-nanoparticle probes offer a new tool for exploring nanoscale systems.

These systems include the fluid equations (for example, Stokes or Navier-Stokes equations) and the equations describing the position of a swimming device (or a living organism) in the fluid. The swimming motion of the latter is the result of the action of internal forces generated by the device, which also serve as the external forces for the surrounding fluid. In a typical swimming model the aforementioned internal forces are either the forces, preserving the structure of the device at hand or the propulsion forces (for example, of rotation or rowing nature), which make it swim. The magnitudes of the latter forces are modeled as coefficients and serve as nontraditional (in the framework of the mathematical controllability theory) multiplicative or bilinear controls.<br/><br/>In this project we will investigate the mathematical nature of the swimming motion of a mechanical device (such as a robotic fish or a robotic eel) or a living organism in a fluid. What makes the latter to swim the way it does? Or more precisely, what kind forces are necessary to employ to achieve the desirable swimming motion? How can we design a mechanical device that can do the same? Answers to these questions are of great interest in biological and medical applications and in engineering applications dealing with propulsion systems in fluids.

The primary<br/>goal is to image possible along-strike variations in the inter-seismic<br/>deformation field.  While the inter-seismic deformation field is<br/>interesting in its own right, and can be used to determine which parts<br/>of the subduction interface are locked (and might rupture in future<br/>earthquakes), the objective is to model this deformation so that it<br/>can be removed. This study seeks to isolate subtle low-amplitude<br/>deformation, including: 1) Bulk post-seismic relaxation following<br/>recent subduction zone earthquakes. 2) Aseismic motion on shallow<br/>crustal faults related to long-term mountain-building. 3) Magma<br/>movements in deep sub-crustal reservoirs and at low rates in shallow<br/>chambers.  This study will use methods similar to those of previous<br/>studies (e.g., Peltzer et al., 2001, Wright et al., 2001), but will<br/>increase the amount of data and spatial coverage by 1-2 orders of<br/>magnitude, from the 10's of scenes of InSAR data used in previous<br/>studies to nearly 1000 scenes.<br/><br/>This study will help to better characterize hazards from earthquakes<br/>in two different environments -- subduction zones and within the<br/>continents.  This project will also extend our previous surveys of<br/>hundreds of volcanoes for active deformation that could indicate<br/>magmatic movements and the need for further assessment of eruptive<br/>hazard.  The software that will be developed in this study will become<br/>publicly available. This study will involve the training of graduate<br/>and undergraduate students, and will support an early career<br/>scientist.<br/>

The approach to bubble-based sensing is based on that gas bubbles are electrical insulators and the resistance of a microfluidic channel containing the bubble is a sensitive measure of the bubble size, and hence factors that affect it - pressure, flow rate, etc. The approach would add a new group of flow sensing elements into the functional scheme of the microfluidic lab-chip. Both bubble volume and bubble deflation rate are utilized as the sensing modalities. A family of generic sensors including pressure sensors, flow meters, and a novel flow regulator will be developed. These sensors will be designed, characterized, and calibrated in detail towards optimizing and enhancing their sensitivity and dynamic response. <br/>Intellectual merit of the these activities include fundamental understanding of microfluidics, as well as broad applications in fields ranging from engineering, biotechnology, to combinatorial and analytical chemistry. Broader educational and outreach impact involve training of undergraduate, graduate, minority, and women students.

These instruments will be housed in the core DNA sequencing center (DNASC) at Brigham Young University (BYU). The DNASC was established in 1998 solely by BYU, and serves faculty from six departments and two colleges on campus, as well as patrons from institutions off campus. Enhancing the DNASC core facility with appropriate technical equipment provides a cost-effective central location that will aid collaborative research and the new lines of investigation. The new instruments will provide the following: 1) enhance the scope of research by increasing data accuracy and throughput for a large group of researchers on and off campus; 2) enhance and provide new teaching and state-of-the-art equipment training to a large group of undergraduate and graduate students involved in faculty-mentored research; and 3) increase and enhance the involvement of student researchers in data analyses and manuscript preparation aspects of research by decreasing the time currently spent in several repetitive processes supplanted by the robotic equipment.<br/><br/> Many avenues of research, and student training through direct participation in this research, will be impacted by the new equipment. Active research programs include, among others, the molecular biology of cartilage differentiation, protein signaling, virus reservoirs and epidemiology, plant and animal systematics, nematode biology and pathogenesis, indigenous crop improvement, conservation biology, molecular ecology, and DNA sequence analysis. The instrumentation requested will impact the large student-research mentoring program at BYU by effecting the following outcomes: 1) provide opportunities for students to gain real-world experience with modern equipment and gain training through four current and one to-be-established courses; 2) enable student researchers to increase involvement in analytical, data synthesis, and manuscript writing phases of research that demand and develop greater cognitive and critical thinking skills by decreasing time spent in repetitive tasks; and 3) involve students in collaborative projects at the forefront of biology made feasible by access to this equipment. Continued heavy participation in graduate and undergraduate mentored-research experiences by women and underrepresented groups is anticipated. Visitation and use of the enhanced DNASC by off campus users and visiting scholars, already common activities, are also expected to increase.

An important protein involved in this regulation is a master regulatory protein known as the class II transactivator (CIITA). Upon infection, CIITA acts to induce the expression of a particular subset of genes, thereby activating the immune system and leading to a vigorous effort by the body to combat the pathogen. Individuals with mutations in CIITA do not exhibit a normal immune response and ultimately leads to death in early childhood due to common infections. Despite its prominent role in triggering an immune response, the cellular mechanisms that control CIITA activity are not well understood. One mechanism being explored is the role of addition or subtraction of phosphate on CIITA function. CIITA present in the nucleus of cells is phosphorylated, which correlates with its inability to induce the expression of immune system genes. CIITA is also exported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm of cells, although the rationale for this export remains to be determined. One hypothesis is that phosphorylation of nuclear CIITA specifically causes it to interact with proteins that drive CIITA out of the nucleus, thereby shutting down CIITA-regulated expression of immune system genes. This may allow the organism to rapidly and precisely control the extent of CIITA activity and therefore mediate the magnitude of an immune response. Preliminary results identified several proteins that potentially interact with CIITA, which may be specifically involved in phosphorylating CIITA and controlling its cytoplasmic/nuclear localization, thereby playing a critical role in regulating CIITA function. However, the means by which these proteins interact with CIITA as well as their specific mechanisms of controlling CIITA activity within a cell have yet to be identified. This project examines the ability of these proteins to interact with CIITA, modify its structure, alter its location in the cell, and regulate its function in initiating the expression of immune system genes. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control CIITA activity will be crucial to devising strategies to manipulate the immune system and alter immune responses. Broader Impacts: This project seeks to further develop the first active, on-going laboratory research program at the college, providing an opportunity for undergraduate students to participate in the project and gain valuable experience and exposure to molecular biology research design, methodology, data collection and results interpretation. During the three-year timeframe of this project, undergraduate students will be intimately involved in the program as summer or academic year interns. Furthermore, this project will form the basis for the addition of experimental research courses to the biology curriculum, expanding opportunities for students to gain laboratory experience within the framework of their studies. By bringing together students and faculty and providing opportunities to participate in molecular biology research, this project will establish the foundation for further curricular development and strengthen undergraduate scientific training at Sarah Lawrence College.

Kalman, Principal Investigator) and the University of Vermont (UVM; Dr. Kenneth I. Golden, Principal Investigator).<br/><br/>Strong Coulomb interactions are featured by a variety of physical systems. Of primary interest are laboratory dusty plasmas, charged particles confined in cryogenic traps and storage rings, layered charged particle systems in semiconductor quantum wells, and astrophysical plasmas (giant planetary and white dwarf interiors, e.g.). The joint BC/UVM research project will focus on these systems.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses some of the major theoretical issues related to<br/>Experiments in strongly coupled systems: correlation and static structure functions, thermodynamics (equation of state and phase boundaries), dielectric response and collective mode behavior. Similar issues arise in multi-layer semiconductor plasmas whose consideration also forms a part of the proposed work.<br/><br/>The main approach to be used in the proposed investigations relies on a series of works by the Principal Investigators in which a method especially appropriate for the description of the dynamical behavior of strongly coupled (correlated) plasmas was worked out. This method, referred to as the Quasi-Localized Charge Approximation, was used in the previous funding periods and has provided theoretical, transparent models for the interpretation of laboratory experiments and computer simulations. This analytical work will be paralleled by molecular dynamics simulations done in collaboration with a research group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Budapest)].

This gap contains phytoplankton (including many diatoms and dinoflagellates) that can bloom in coastal waters, and microzooplanton such as protozoa that are critical to the diets of copepods and larval fish, so it is important that we monitor the organisms in this size range. The goal of this proposal, is to complete development and testing of a submersible imaging flow cytometer designed to characterize these large phytoplankton and microzooplanktonic organisms. The new instrument is a modified version of FlowCytobot that uses a combination of flow cytometric and video technology to capture high resolution (1 m) images of organisms for identification and to measure chlorophyll fluorescence associated with each image. Images will be classified by software based on a support vector machine approach, while the measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence will allow us to discriminate heterotrophic from phototrophic cells in taxa (such as dinoflagellates) that contain both kinds of members. Quantification of chlorophyll fluorescence in large phytoplankton cells will also enable patterns in bulk chlorophyll data to be better interpreted.<br/>Construction of a working version of Imaging FlowCytobot is nearly completed. The new instrument retains the anti-fouling and performance-monitoring capabilities of the original FlowCytobot; it operates autonomously but is remotely programmable and samples continuously; data will be transferred via Ethernet and fiber optic cables to a remote computer for analysis. The next steps in development involve field testing at WHOI and MVCO, optimizing the instrument on the basis of results from this testing, and refining the analysis and control software.

While the knowledge base on the ecological effects of fire in sub-Saharan Africa is considerable, the specific dynamics surrounding anthropogenic burning and savanna systems remain largely understudied and poorly understood, especially in regard to the linkages among human burning practices, fire regimes, and savanna vegetation. Graduate student Ramona Butz, under the direction of Dr. Daniel Potter, will address land use conflict and the impact of pastoral fire management through an investigation of how plant community structure, species composition, and relative abundance differs between areas managed and unmanaged by Maasai pastoralists in two northern Tanzanian villages. The research will establish existing and historic burning conditions through observation, interviews, written history, and interpretation of available aerial photography. Ms. Butz will also determine whether burning practices alter species richness and structure of vegetation communities, particularly with respect to green desertification, a form of savanna degradation involving the nearly complete replacement of perennial grasses by annual grasses and the widespread encroachment of acacia thornbush into grassland communities. The results of the previous stages will then be used to create conservation strategies and alternatives designed specifically for Maasai villagers, local conservation organizations, and governing officials. In addition to clarifying the historical and contemporary processes that govern plant community composition and its relationship with traditional fire management, this work has important implications for policy and conservation efforts. It is an opportunity to use science to influence critical policy decisions, not only for Tanzania, but as a model for other joint land use management systems.

It also has a close connection to<br/>Briancon-Skoda type theorems and to a conjecture by Kawamata about<br/>sections of line bundles. The proposer intends to further explore this<br/>interplay by studying the relation between cores and adjoints or<br/>multiplier ideals. Having worked on a formula for the core in<br/>equicharacteristic zero, he wishes to obtain a similar explicit expression<br/>in positive characteristic, where the shape of the core is markedly<br/>different. Likewise he would like to find a combinatorial description for<br/>the core of monomial ideals. The investigator plans to continue his work<br/>on blowup algebras of ideals, most notably of zero-dimensional ideals in<br/>regular local rings. He asks whether the quasi-Gorenstein property of the<br/>extended Rees algebra implies the Gorensteinness of the associated graded<br/>ring. He also suggests that the normality or Cohen-Macaulayness of the<br/>special fiber ring of a Gorenstein ideal may force the ideal to be a<br/>complete intersection. On a more computational note, he addresses the<br/>problem of constructing the integral closure of algebras, in particular of<br/>Rees algebras. Passing to the integral closure of the Rees algebra of an<br/>ideal is the first step towards resolution of singularities and the only<br/>known general method for computing the integral closure of the ideal. The<br/>proposer wishes to estimate the complexity of this process by finding bounds<br/>on the number of generators of the integral closure, the degrees of the<br/>generators and the number of steps required in the computation. As another<br/>measure of complexity he plans to study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity<br/>of powers and symmetric powers of homogeneous ideals having dimension at<br/>most one. He expects that estimates on the regularity do not only persist<br/>when the ideal is raised to powers, but that they actually improve. Similar<br/>improved bounds for the regularity of symmetric powers would help finding<br/>the equations of Rees algebras and thereby lead to efficient algorithms in<br/>elimination theory. The proposer also intends to continue his work on<br/>generalized principal ideal theorems. The goal is to bound the codimension<br/>and prove connectedness properties for degeneracy loci of maps of modules<br/>that are not necessarily free; here one has to assume that the maps are not<br/>`too generic'. The investigator proposes a weak version of this condition<br/>by introducing a notion of ampleness for modules over local rings. He<br/>hopes to prove principal ideal theorems that only require the weaker<br/>assumption, thus generalizing the known results in both local algebra and<br/>projective geometry.<br/><br/><br/>The investigator works in Commutative Algebra, an area concerned with the<br/>qualitative study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables.<br/>Such systems arise in numerous applications outside of mathematics. Over<br/>the past two decades commutative algebraists have become increasingly<br/>interested in computational aspects, thereby emphasizing connections to<br/>applied areas such as computer algebra, robotics, cryptography and coding<br/>theory. This investigator's research too has a strong computational<br/>component.<br/>Part of the project involving the collaboration with mathematicians in Brazil is funded by the NSF<br/>Office of International Science and Engineering

Natural History collections have traditionally served as a resource for research on the taxonomy and systematics of organisms. Increasingly, specimens and their data are being used in studies of ecology, conservation and environmental biology. A major hurdle in implementing such studies with museum data is that collection localities in most museum databases are not georeferenced (i.e., they lack latitude and longitude coordinates). In the vast majority of instances, the collection locality is recorded or digitized as a string of text describing the location as a position along a road some distance and compass direction from a town or other geographic point of reference. Traditional methods of georeferencing these data (capturing map coordinates) are tedious and time consuming, typically involving finding the locality on either hardcopy or digital maps, plotting the locality, and determining the coordinates by hand or with the aid of the computer. In prior support the PIs have developed a software tool called GEOLocate that uses a patternmatching algorithm to break down the locality text string into basic directional, distance and geographic place components. The algorithm uses place-name databases and other information sources to quickly return fairly accurate latitude and longitude coordinates. GEOLocate includes visualization, correction and error-estimation features that allow users to more precisely fix a position and return geo-coordinates to a database. The current version GEOLocate was developed for georeferencing North American collections (United State, Canada and Mexico) and is highly effective in this area. The tool has been distributed to over 140 users and is gaining wide acceptance in the natural history collection community. <br/>This award is about expanding coverage of the tool to the entire world and making it multilingual to serve international users and to allow North American users to georeference international collections. A world version of GEOLocate will be a valuable tool for georeferencing the estimated 3 billion specimen records in the world's natural history collections and would help facilitate uses of specimen data in the emerging field of biodiversity informatics. As such, GEOLocate World would be an important component of computing toolkits in the Global Biodiversity Infrastructure Facility (GBIF) and the proposed Legacy Infrastructure Network for Natural Environments. The taxonomic footprint verification service will allow experts to visualize taxonomic data in a geographic context. This project will provide cross-discipline training for two graduate students from computer sciences and biological sciences.

Wayland, Chemistry Department, University of Pennsylvania, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for the study of metal-centered radicals and organometallic complexes in the controlled radical polymerizations of olefins. Low spin cobalt(II) metal-centered radicals are highly effective in the catalytic chain transfer that controls molecular weight and introduces end group alkene functionality during radical polymerization. Consequently, kinetic-mechanistic studies of catalytic chain transfer by low spin cobalt(II) metalloradicals and the measurement of organo-cobalt and other organo-metal bond dissociation thermodynamics will be undertaken. Organo-cobalt porphyrin complexes mediate a highly precise living radical polymerization of acrylate monomers to form low polydispersity homo-polymers and block copolymers. Hence, the mechanism of this polymerization process will be studied, the scope of organo-metallic species that catalyze the polymerization will be evaluated, and the factors that promote and inhibit radical interchange during the polymerization will be determined. The living radical polymerization method will be exploited to prepare new classes of functionalized polymeric materials.<br/><br/>Polyolefins are important commercial products. This research will develop a rational approach to the synthesis of various polyolefins and potentially result in new structurally defined block copolymers with unexplored material properties. Students involved in the study will learn not only sophisticated methods involving inorganic and organic chemistry, but will be introduced to major issues and challenges in energy-related research, polymer chemistry, catalysis and materials science.

It is based on the classical technique of lifting dynamical systems to the space of linear operators on an algebra of smooth functions. This project will use the CC to investigate the geometric and algebraic foundations of fully nonlinear control systems as they commonly appear, in particular, in models in the bio-medical sciences. Typical items are the curvature of optimal control, and ideal structures in Zinbiel algebras. One challenge is to merge the formal work in combinatorics and nonassociative algebra with rigorous justifications how these formal objects map onto analytic and geometric structures. A key objective is to understand how the underlying geometry affects and limits the structural behavior of dynamical systems that model diverse applications. Moreover, the algebraic and combinatorial tools developed in this project also yield compact algorithmic tools that lend themselves to high performance computation.<br/><br/>This project will have diverse broader impacts, both horizontally and vertically: The tools and methodologies to be developed are immediately applicable in a diverse set of disciplines, basically everywhere where it matters in which order actions are taken. The classes of systems considered in this project have uses that include quantum systems, high performance numerical computation, operations research, and many areas in the biomedical sciences, from population dynamics to pharmacokinetics and molecular biology. Motivated by applied problems, this project develops new mathematical tools, and makes them available to the applied sciences, thereby strengthening interdisciplinary ties. Complementing the horizontal impacts, this project will also enhance the vertical integration and the local infrastructure by developing an attractive control curriculum that acts as a pipeline to funnel new talents from all backgrounds into becoming active participants in the discovery process. Principal means for this are exciting problems that connect control theory and the biosciences, and the highly experimental nature of using interactive visualization tools in this project. Both of these allow undergraduates to start meaningful participation with only minimal formal prerequisites while seamlessly leading to advanced theoretical work.

In particular, we explore new networking architecture and network elements that will lead to a future network with (a) improved robustness and adaptability, (b) improved usability and comprehensibility, (c) improved security and stability, and (d) reduced human intervention for operation and configuration.

This objective is far from accomplished. By different estimates, over 30-50% of the genes in any given organism are of unknown function, incorrectly annotated or merely given a broad nonspecific annotation. With more than 230 genomes sequenced and 1220 in the pipeline, unknown or incorrectly identified genes are propagating at an exponential rate making it all the more difficult to extract correct functional information. Since the discovery of Archaea as a primary domain, the uniqueness of the molecular characteristics of Archaea, their metabolic and environmental adaptations as well as their key role in understanding the evolution of life have come to light. In all organisms, including Archaea, tRNA modifications are at the core of the translation apparatus. They influence the decoding properties and stabilities of tRNAs in cell and have been proposed to have been present in the Last Universal Common Ancestor. Analysis of the distribution and characteristics of tRNA modification enzymes in Archaea will increase our understanding of the role of RNA modification both in modern and extant organisms. However most of the tRNA modification genes of Archaea have not yet been identified. By combining comparative genomic analysis with experimental validation this project will focus on identifying and characterizing putative and missing archaeal tRNA modification genes. The result of this research will improve genome annotations, lead to a better understanding of the function of tRNA modification in Archaea (which at this time are totally unknown), discover novel enzyme activities and pathways and gain insights into the origin of the RNA modification machinery. This project will provide informatics and functional annotation experience to undergraduate students.

In their individual laboratories, scientists in each of these disciplines have begun to use molecular tools to explore the genome of F. heteroclitus, also known as the mudminnow, mummichog or killifish. This proposal seeks to bring together the community of researchers working on Fundulus to share existing resources and to develop common molecular and computational resources that would be made available to all. The immediate goal is to create a library of genes that are important to survival and reproduction in Fundulus by pooling information that is already available among this wide-spread group of researchers. From this library of genes, thousands of different Fundulus DNA segments could be produced and bound to special microscope slides, called microarrays. If these microarrays are copied and made widely available, they can be used to evaluate changes in gene activity in Fundulus as a function of the internal or external environment. Additional goals of this proposal are to develop common bioinformatic tools and platforms for effective exchange of data among the user community, as well as to promote synergistic activities, including printing and quality-control of common microarray formats, and further exploration of the Fundulus genome. By bringing together those who would share their resources and intimate knowledge of the Fundulus genome with those who would apply these genome-enabled techniques for basic and applied research, the proposed activity will catalyze high-quality science and create new resources for the greater community of scientists.

The research will extend the PI's work in the area of reactive intermediates trapped inside molecular cages referred to as hemicarcerands. The encapsulated intermediates will be generated photochemically from precursor molecules inside a suitable hemicarcerand cage that protects the reactive intermediate from dimerization and from reaction with molecules that are too large to enter the molecular cage. The spectroscopic properties of these reactive intermediates, their intramolecular rearrangements, and their reaction with the surrounding host or small bulk phase reactants will be investigated by NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. This approach, which will be used to study a variety of highly strained or electron deficient reactive intermediates, will allow studies of energetic species that are normally stable only at extremely low temperatures or for fractions of a second at room temperature. The NMR spectroscopic characterization, which is only practical using this approach, will provide new insight into the electronic, magnetic, and structural properties of these intermediates.<br/><br/>These investigations of encapsulated reactive intermediates and strained organic molecules, which will provide fundamental new information on chemical reactivity, will have significant impact on areas ranging from pharmaceutical chemistry to materials science. The research provides an excellent way of preparing students for future careers in industry or academia. The program is committed to achieving diversity among student researchers and will strongly encourage undergraduate students to participate.

Shukla<br/>Virginia Polytechnic Institute @ State University<br/><br/>Today's computing is no longer limited to servers, work stations and desktop computing, but they are embedded everywhere, most importantly in the medical space, as well as in the safety critical systems such as avionics control, automotive control etc. However, historically hardware and software have been built separately, and both being extremely complex, the methodologies that ensure correct construction of hardware or software are themselves research topics. Yet, we are faced with the need for formal and mathematical techniques to model and analyze systems which integrate both hardware and software,<br/>because of the increasing reliance of human society on ubiquitous and pervasive computing.<br/>In 2003 the First International ACM/IEEE Formal Methods and Models for Co-Design (MEMOCODE) conference, for the first time, brought together researchers who apply formal methods in software engineering fields, and those who apply formal methods to design and validate hardware systems. It was felt by attendees that formal method practitioners from both sides have a lot to share in terms of knowledge, experience and techniques. In 2004 the Second International ACM/MEMOCODE was held in San<br/>Diego, California. It was emphasized that the hardware-software co-design problem imposes an ever than before need for this symbiosis, which was the original aims of creating this series of conferences. More importantly, the US researchers present at the conference last two years felt that there is a lack of research activity in this important area of formal methods in the US, compared to the initiatives and research activities in Europe.

The goal is to integrate technologies of Artificial Intelligence into the data processing pipelines of major current and future ground- and space-based observational programs. The motivation for the proposed program lies in the expected growth in number of discovered variables with the growth of observational capabilities. A direct benefit of the research will be the use of eclipsing binaries in the Local Group for the study of galaxy evolution and cosmology. The broader impact of the work will be a large number of variable star datasets that will be made available to the astronomical community, as well as algorithms that will be useful for a broad range of instruments now in existence, and many that are planned. Undergraduates will also participate in the work, providing for a research-based educational experience for the students.

As a result, it is also becoming<br/>increasingly difficult to understand and then manage application behavior,<br/>particularly for applications that are critical to the ability of<br/>organizations to provide services for which they have contractual obligations.<br/><br/>Georgia Tech's `Service Paths' project is developing technologies for<br/>(1) dynamically discovering the critical `paths' applications follow<br/>through distributed sets of services, and (2) managing such paths in<br/>order to improve an application's ability to meet dynamic service level<br/>agreements. Service path technologies will substantially improve systems'<br/>abilities to provide end-to-end guarantees and enhance the underlying<br/>systems' capabilities to provide such guarantees. Concrete outcomes include<br/>new system-level methods and abstractions to better understand current<br/>application behavior, new middleware abstractions suitable both for<br/>constructing and managing large-scale software overlays across many<br/>machines, and experimental results attained with virtualized platforms<br/>like PlanetLab and with novel hardware support for runtime platform<br/>virtualization.<br/><br/>Broader significance: the costs of developing and changing modern IT<br/>infrastructures are now dominated by personnel rather than hardware.<br/>Technology providers have reacted to this fact by making it increasingly<br/>easy to develop complex distributed applications.

However, there are animals, including several amphibians and reptiles, that survive northern winters in part by an ability to tolerate being frozen.  This research will examine the physiological mechanisms responsible for freeze tolerance in one of those species, Cope's gray treefrog.  This frog is unusual among freeze-tolerant vertebrates in that it accumulates glycerol in its body fluids as a cryoprotective agent; glycerol is also commonly used in biomedical preservative solutions.  Specific questions to be addressed are how glycerol moves in and out of tissues of the treefrogs as they acclimate to cold and actually freeze, and how the glycerol movement is related to the distribution of water among tissues, which is critical to preventing ice formation inside cells where it would lead to lethal damage.  In particular, experiments will investigate the role of aquaporins in accomplishing that glycerol and water movement.  Aquaporins are proteins known to form passageways that allow water and, sometimes, other small molecules like glycerol to cross cell membranes, and it is hypothesize that they are critical to freeze tolerance.  The objectives are to enhance the understanding of this fascinating natural phenomenon, and to use a natural model of freeze tolerance to elucidate principles that can be applied to biomedical cryopreservation.  In the process, this work will provide training to undergraduate students at multiple levels of analysis, from principles of comparative biology to whole animals and molecular biology.  This training will encourage integrative thinking and application of diverse methods to the study of animal physiology.<br/><br/>

The pathway that triggers flower formation is the focus of this research. The master regulator LEAFY is instrumental for switching between the vegetative and the reproductive developmental program, yet the steps downstream (after) LEAFY are poorly understood. This research project will investigate events following LEAFY activation that culminate in formation of the first flower. Several new regulators of this process were identified previously and are currently being characterized. Because the regulatory mechanism studied is conserved in many crop plants, this research has the potential to benefit agricultural crop production. In addition the project provides training for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in state-of-the art Molecular Biology and Genetic research.

Fogarty to work with Dr. Jean-Pierre Dutasta at Ecole Normale Superieure Lyon in France.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project aims to synthesize new cryptophanes with covalently bound luminophores and to study their photophysical properties to obtain an understanding of their applicability for use as sensors. The first research aspect concerns the design and synthesis of cryptophanes whose electronic emission and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) shift are suitable for detection in biosensor applications. The second aspect concerns the influence of a guest, contained in the cavity of a cryptophane, on the photophysical properties of the cage and of the fluorophore located outside the cavity. Preparation of these derivatives will utilize recently developed experimental procedures. The characterization of the new compounds is based on NMR spectroscopy (multi-nuclei and multidimensional techniques). Photophysical properties of the new derivatives will be investigated, in the presence or absence of a guest, by UV-Vis spectroscopy, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence, and circular dichroism (for enantiopure compounds). The presence of a guest such as xenon in the solution containing the molecular probe should modify the photophysical properties (lifetime of the excited state, shift of the emission energy, etc.) of the cryptophane, and possibly the luminophore. <br/><br/>Since 1988, Dr. Dutasta and his group have been the principal researchers on cryptophanes, actively developing the chemistry of their remarkable binding properties towards guests that has resulted in a better understanding of molecular recognition phenomena and 10 publications in international journals since 2001.
0503350	Doctoral Dissertation Research: Strategies for Avoiding Risk: Behavior Autonomy among Adolescent Girls in Rural Malawi	SES	SOCIOLOGY	07/01/2005	07/15/2005	Patricia Rieker	MA	Trustees of Boston University	Standard Grant	Patricia White	06/30/2006	$7,340.00		rieker@bu.edu	881 COMMONWEALTH AVE	BOSTON	MA	022151300	6173534365	SBE	1331	9178, SMET	$0.00	SES-0503350<br/>Patricia P. Rieker <br/>Michelle J. Poulin <br/>Boston University <br/><br/>The overall aim of the research is to identify the behavioral factors and conditions that enable adolescent girls to develop successful strategies of HIV prevention in the context of the AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa, where gender inequality is widely considered to be a major contributor to the spread of the disease. Thus much of the social science research tends to focus on the construction of men as dominant and women and girls as vulnerable to infection because they are poorer and less powerful, and therefore dependent on the exchange of risky behavior for basic survival needs. While important, this focus diverts attention away from the ways in which young women and girls do exercise autonomy and control over their lives. For example, the majority of adolescent girls are not infected, even in poverty-stricken rural Malawi, the country with the 8th highest HIV prevalence in the world. To address the knowledge gap, this research asks the following questions: What are the characteristics of girls who avoid risky behavior? What are the aspects of their social and cultural context that encourage them to make safer behavioral decisions, despite their poverty? And, what are the identifiable entry points that can be incorporated into effective interventions that strengthen their capacity to prevent infection?<br/><br/>The research will be conducted in two locales in Malawi, selected because they are quite different in many respects: the northern Tumbukas are patrilineal, more educated and Protestant, and the southern Yaos, on the other hand, are less educated, Muslim, and follow a matrilineal system of inheritance and matrilocal residence pattern following marriage. A mixed-methods approach will be employed to address the questions discussed above. (1) Survey data for approximately 1200 young men and women (age 15-24) will be analyzed in order to understand: a) what characteristics distinguish those who have successfully avoided infection from those who have not, and b) what social conditions and situations enable young women to protect themselves from HIV and STI infection. The larger sample is part of the on-going longitudinal study, the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP), which investigates the role of networks on various health-related outcomes. (2) In-depth interviews will be conducted with approximately 80 unmarried young women and men selected from the larger survey sample stratified by region of the country, age and infection status. Collectively, these data will enable me to describe the development of strategies of prevention, the behavior autonomy exercised to implement these strategies in premarital relationships, and the contextual differences in both their development and implementation. <br/><br/>The information gathered from this study will be the first of its kind in Malawi, and in all likelihood, sub-Saharan Africa, especially with its unique emphasis on how young women protect themselves from infection These findings are expected to contribute to the fields of women's studies, public health, and medical sociology in important ways, both methodologically and theoretically. Just as the academic literature is limited in scope, so too, is the research on which prevention programs are based. Typically and understandably, research on women rests on their construction as poor and powerless, or on those who are known to be at high risk (e.g. commercial sex workers). The focus of this project, in contrast, is on young women who provide examples of success at avoiding infection, and thus may influence public health programs intended to provide support to those who are struggling to survive an epidemic.

This makes it increasingly difficult to supply energy to devices and to cool these devices. Poweraware computation is especially important in the domain of sensor networks which are composed of small battery-powered nodes. Power management in sensor networks is viewed as so critical that it must be dealt with at all layers of the protocol stack.<br/><br/>Many power management techniques have been proposed and implemented. Most of these techniques are similar in that they reduce or eliminate power to some or all components of the device. However, there is an inherent conflict between power management and performance; in general, the more power that is available, the better the performance that can be achieved. As a result, it is generally proposed that power reduction techniques be preferentially applied during times when performance is less<br/>critical. However, this requires a policy to determine how essential performance is at any given time and how to apply a particular power reduction technique. For example, to use the frequency scaling technique, where the speed of the clock is changed dynamically, one needs a policy to set the speed at each point in time. There is a growing consensus that these policies must incorporate information provided by applications and high levels of the operating system, and that current tools and mechanisms for power management are inadequate and require more research. The authors propose to formalize power<br/>management problems as optimization problems, and then develop algorithms that are optimal by these criteria. The goal of this research is to develop effective algorithms for specific problems within the domain of power management, as well as to build a toolkit of widely applicable algorithmic methods for problems that arise in energy-bounded and temperature-bounded computation. The authors propose to initially focus on problems that deal with speed scaling and power-down techniques, since these are currently the dominant techniques in practice.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The authors propose to both develop fundamental theoretical techniques, and to apply these techniques to attack timely and important applications in computer systems. Both PIs have an established track record of working closely with researchers in applied areas to ensure that the theoretical models developed match the associated real-world problems. This is essential for theoretical results to have an impact. This work will continue to foster this very productive cross-fertilization between<br/>these experimental systems researchers and theoretical computer science. The students supported under this grant will be influenced by this philosophy of research. They will be trained to be proactive in working with researchers in applied domains to bring important and interesting problems into the theory community. They will also be encouraged to publish the resulting work in systems as well as theory conferences to ensure that new algorithmic discoveries have an impact. As part of this project, the authors also plan to continue outreach work to high schools students, encouraging underrepresented groups to choose careers in technology related fields. They have developed a talk outlining diverse opportunities within computer science and plan to involve graduate and undergraduate students in presenting this talk at local high schools. The work in this proposal is featured in the talk. In addition, they plan to involve students from underrepresented groups in research projects related to power management.

Protocols used for preparing the modern wood Oracle database, InsideWood (http://insidewood.lib.ncsu.edu/search), will be adapted for incorporating the fossil wood database (1500+ records) into the InsideWood web site. Images have been created and indexed in accordance with Library of Congress best practices for digital collections. Each of the 36,0000 + images in the database is linked via metadata tags to specimen information, taxonomic information, and contributor information. These databases have been developed with non-exclusive, open architecture to allow for long-term sustainability. The fossil wood database is the most complete compilation of information on fossil dicot wood anatomy. Making this database Internet accessible, accompanied by images and multiple search strategies, is significant for research into the past distribution and diversity of trees, shrubs, and vines, tracking evolutionary trends, and reconstructing ancient environments. The modern dicot wood database of InsideWood, which uses International Association of Wood Anatomists (IAWA) terminology, is the most extensive internet-accessible compendium of wood anatomical information. This database also makes available for the first time wood descriptions and images of some threatened species of North American trees and shrubs not published elsewhere. A large image database of modern woods allows evaluation of wood anatomical characters for inclusion into phylogenetic analyses. These images are an invaluable addition to InsideWood's multiple-entry key for wood identification. This key is useful for determining the affinities of both fossil and modern dicot woods. Wood identification also helps archaeologists address questions about ancient vegetation and the context for human evolution, past uses of natural resources, and trade routes. Wood anatomical information is also used in a variety of research projects in forest biology and ecology. The InsideWood site provides instructors in botany, forest biology, and ecology courses with an extensive global encyclopedia of reliably identified photomicrographs. These images show wood anatomical diversity and illustrate structure-function relationships, and complement existing textbooks. With images and other information from InsideWood, instructors can create tutorials on wood anatomy and identification to incorporate into their curricula; students can use these data in research projects. InsideWood provides access to images of fossil wood for public programs at National and State Parks and museums. The image database and the multiple-entry wood identification key are also of practical significance for forensic scientists, customs agents, antique dealers, and museum curators who need to identify wood. Wood identification has legal or conservation implications, as timber identification is necessary for enforcing CITES regulations.

We will address two sets of important and closely related technical issues for this high-end scientific computing project. First, the targeted problems for the proposed project are large-scale direct and inverse scattering problems that can be only solved in high-end systems. These problems involve<br/>particularly electromagnetic wave propagation with high wave numbers. A major difficulty for solving the inverse problems by an optimization method is the ill-posedness and the presence of many local minima. We propose a novel approach for solving the inverse medium scattering problem of Maxwell's equations in three dimensions. Crucial to the approach will be the development of an efficient regularized iterative linearization algorithm (recursive linearization with respect to the wave number). A challenge in<br/>developing our numerical methods is to deal with large and structured data sets. The second set of technical issues for solving the targeted problems is concerned with the lack of system support in high-end architectures to maintain high sustained performance of<br/>computing due to increasingly high speed gap between the CPU and the memory and the I/O storage. This challenge can also be found in many other large scientific computation problems on high-end systems. An equivalently important objective to the scientific computing in this proposal is to design and build effective system support by effectively allocating both CPU and memory resources, by establishing a global network RAM system in high-end architecture, and by providing exceptional system handlers to deal with dynamic and unexpectedlylarge memory demands from applications.<br/><br/>Intellectual merits of this proposal come from several aspects. (1) Our proposed numerical methods will address several scientific challenges in applied mathematics including electromagnetic wave propagation with high wave numbers, ill-posedness for inverse problems, and management of large data sets in multiple dimensions. (2) Processors and high-end systems have become increasingly complex, which makes the understanding of execution behavior more and more difficult. Our proposed system support based on both hardware counters and a system kernel instrumentation tool will address the system complexity issue, and provide insightful runtime system information for resource management systems with low overhead. (3) In order to effectively support high sustained performance and high productivity computing in clusters, our system support aims for several important resource management objectives, such as high memory utilization, low communication latency, and fast response time. (4) Although our system will be mainly tested by solving the large direct and inverse problems, it is also our aim to build it as a general purpose system so that it will become a fundamental software system infrastructure for many other large scientific applications in high-end systems.<br/><br/>Broader impact of this proposal will be: (1) Due to the fast development of high performance systems, computational electromagnetics has become a fundamental, vigorously growing technology in diverse science and engineering disciplines, such as<br/>microwaves, millimeter waves, optics, and acoustics. Our computational models and cluster system support will provide an inexpensive and easily controllable ``virtual prototype of the structures/media as opposed to costly, time-consuming physical prototyping. (2) The proposed system resource management tools and system prototype will be disseminated in the high-end computing and systems community for a wide usage. (3) The research results will be timely introduced to both undergraduate and graduate curriculum development of scientific computing, parallel computing, and operating systems.

Storrs	CT	062691133	8604863622	CSE	1708	7203, 9184, BIOT	$0.00	Quantum computing offers powerful new ways to solve cryptographic problems far more efficiently than classical computers can. This project focuses on the development of new quantum algorithms for problems such as Graph Isomorphism, for which there is no known efficient algorithm on classical computers. We focus on the Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) and its relatives. The HSP framework made its first appearance in the seminal work of Simon and Shor, where it led to efficient quantum algorithms for several basic problems in computational number theory, including integer factoring and computing discrete logarithms. In particular, Shor's algorithm for the HSP on the cyclic group makes it possible to break the RSA public-key cryptosystem.<br/><br/>The hidden subgroup problems appearing in Simon's and Shor's algorithms take place over commutative groups, a case of the HSP that is now well-understood. The noncommutative hidden subgroup problem is intimately linked to several problems of major interest, including Graph Isomorphism, hidden shift problems, and cryptographically important cases of the Shortest Lattice Vector problem. Despite these incentives, however, the noncommutative HSP has largely resisted the quantum computing community's advances thus far. Efficient algorithms are only known for a few families of groups, and even the information--theoretic aspects of the problem are poorly understood. <br/><br/>This project will seek both efficient quantum algorithms and query-complexity lower bounds for the symmetric group---the case of the HSP relevant to Graph Isomorphism---and other groups of algorithmic interest. Our approach applies the rich mathematical tools of representation theory, adapted bases, and entangled measurements over multiple coset states.

The marching cubes algorithm is a very effective and widely used technique for extracting isosurfaces from scientific data sets. The purpose of this research project is to exploit some special properties of the isosurfaces produced by the marching cubes algorithm in order to develop particularly efficient geometry processing tools for the analysis, manipulation and processing of these surfaces. The intellectual merit of the research project consists of the development of new methods for extracting meaning and understanding from data by new and efficient digital geometry processing tools for the special case of isosurfaces produced by the marching cubes algorithm. Since isosurfaces are widely used in many areas of science, the results of this research will have broad impact on data analysis in general.<br/><br/>It has recently been discovered that the isosurfaces produced by the marching cubes (MC) algorithm have some special properties that allow for the development of particularly efficient geometry processing tools. These properties include (1) some special aspects of a network of orthogonal polygons which allow curve techniques to be lifted to surfaces and (2) a local function property provided by a modification of the original MC method which allows conventional approximation techniques to be applied to these special isosurfaces. This research will concentrate on three aspects of geometry processing for surfaces, namely (1) parameterizations which are necessary for texture mapping, remeshing, compression and many other useful surface operations; (2) methods of estimating curvature and other related surface properties which will serve as the basic tools for many useful higher level surface processing techniques and (3) algorithms for smoothing and fairing surfaces.
0516673	Diploid and Polyploid Hybridity Throughout the Evolutionary History of Glycine (Leguminosae)	DEB	PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS	07/15/2005	04/17/2007	Jeffrey Doyle	NY	Cornell Univ - State: AWDS MADE PRIOR MAY 2010	Continuing grant	Maureen M.

These include the origin of the entire genus associated with an ancient genome duplication event, relationships among the reproductively isolated genome groups to which the approximately 25 diploid perennial species of the genus belong, and the complex history of genetic differentiation among closely related species within these genome groups. All of these issues have in common the possibility that hybridization has played a role in producing the patterns observed in DNA variation from nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genes. Polyploidy (multiple sets of chromosomes) and hybridization separately, or together in allopolyploidy, are two of the most important processes that shape the genomes of plants, including cultivated plants such as wheat, maize, cotton, and soybean. In the case of Glycine it is unknown whether hybridization was involved in polyploid formation, as hypothesized to have occurred 15 million years ago, and if so, what species were the donors of the two genomes. This and other questions at progressively more recent stages in the history of Glycine that involve the role of polyploidy and hybridization can be addressed by studying a large number of genes on the different chromosomes or in different genomic compartments (mitochondrion, chloroplast). The largest source of such genes is the nuclear genome, and this project taps genomic projects in soybean and other legumes (e.g., Medicago truncatula) to provide many candidate genes for study. Around 100 nuclear genes will be assessed for their utility in addressing phylogenetic questions, taking into account such additional criteria as position on the soybean genetic map. Analytical methods will include phylogeny reconstruction using various approaches, assessment of incongruence, testing for polytomies and hybridity, network construction, and admixture assessment. The work will address general issues of dealing with incongruence, identifying and using low copy nuclear genes, and studying polyploidy. <br/>Achieving a better understanding of polyploidy and hybridization in general, and particularly in Glycine, is of broad relevance and significance for plant biology and genetics because of the prevalence of these phenomena. The project will have an impact on the infrastructure of science by training undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow, including minority undergraduate students who will participate in summer research internships. Collaboration with the Cornell Institute for Biology Teachers will lead to the development of phylogeny laboratories for high school and middle school students. The project is international in its scope, with researchers from the United States and Australia, and involves the use and enhancement of germplasm resources in the form of Glycine seed collections in both countries.

This award supports computational and theoretical research and education seeking to elucidate the atomistic mechanisms of fracture and plasticity in nanocrystalline ceramics. Nanostructured silicon carbide (n-SiC) has high fracture toughness and diamond-SiC nanocomposites (n-C-SiC) have high hardness. Grain boundaries (GBs) play a crucial role in the deformation of nanocrystalline metals. The interfaces between the diamond nanoparticles and the SiC matrix in the n-C-SiC likely play a critical role in determining mechanical properties. The PI will perform multimillion-atom MD simulations of nanoindentation and fracture in n-SiC and n-C-SiC on parallel computers to understand atomistic mechanisms underlying high hardness and toughness. The PI plans to:<br/> Characterize the nucleation and kinetics of defects in response to mechanical loading.<br/> Determine the role of GB and bulk deformation.<br/> Identify the effect of GB structures (e.g., twin boundaries), GB diffusion and sliding, as well as of interfacial debonding on hardness and fracture toughness.<br/> The PI will also plans to develop and implement:<br/> Innovative data mining techniques, such as graph-based algorithms, to identify and track topological defects in the resulting massive multivariate datasets.<br/> A hybrid simulation scheme based on temperature accelerated MD, reconstruction of the potential energy landscape, and reaction path sampling to study rare events such as GB diffusion.<br/>The research program will be integrated with training and education activities. These include: 1) multidisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students involving both atomistic simulations and nano-experiments, 2) developing a course on advanced simulations of materials at nanoscale, as part of the interdisciplinary degree of Materials Science Program and the new degree options in Computational<br/>Science and Nanoengineering in the Engineering Physics Department at the University of Wisconsin, (3) facilitating a cross-departmental curriculum in scientific modeling, and (4) developing campus-wide atomic-modeling seminar.<br/>NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION:<br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences contribute funding to this award which falls under the NSF-wide Mathematical Sciences Priority Area. This award supports computational and theoretical research that seeks to understand how ceramic materials fracture and deform starting from the constituent atoms. The PI will focus on ceramic materials that are composed of many nanometer-sized grains. The PI will use large-scale computer simulation techniques involving millions of atoms with the aim of understanding how the hardness of specific materials depends on the size of the grains, how these materials deform when a mechanical stress is applied, and ultimately how to create a material that is both hard and highly resistant to fracture. The proposed research may have impact on the design and nanoengineering of superhard materials that have a broad range of applications. The proposed research also involves developing advanced computational tools including methods to enable simulation for long times and to identify specific arrangements of atoms involved in materials deformation. The research program will be integrated with training and education activities. These include the direct involvement of a graduate student in the research and developing interdisciplinary graduate and undergraduate level courses on advanced computer modeling of materials.

Stanford's main objective is the development of technologies for Advanced LIGO that will increase its sensitivity and thus improve the probability of detection. Research on high power lasers, photo-detectors, and optical configurations that reliably handle high power will be continued toward enhancing LIGO sensitivity at high frequencies. Studies on understanding and minimizing thermal noise in the detector's core optics will be pursued to enhance sensitivity at intermediate frequencies. Improved core optic suspensions and isolation platforms will be developed to enable higher sensitivity at low frequencies where ground vibrations currently limit performance. The Stanford program will also include data analysis and modeling of periodic gravitational wave sources.<br/><br/>Gravitational waves were predicted almost 90 years ago in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, but they have not yet been detected due to the extreme sensitivity required. Interacting black holes, coalescing compact binary stellar systems, stellar collapses, pulsars and low mass X-ray binaries are all possible sources of gravitational waves, as is the random background of radiation from the early universe. Laser interferometer detectors, which operate by measuring strains in the fabric of space-time that are expected to be produced by gravitational waves, are now becoming operational and may soon give us a first detection. Detectors of higher performance, such as Advanced LIGO, should allow us to develop gravitational wave astronomy as a new window on the Universe. Stanford has a strong, multidisciplinary program in developing the technology for such detectors. Participants include mechanical, electrical and control engineers, physicists and materials researchers. The program provides training for future scientists and engineers at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, it integrates basic scientific research with scientific education, and it develops and funds outreach programs that inform and educate the broader community.

The Chinese Continental Drilling Project (CCSD), in the Donghai area of the Sulu terrane, provides a unique opportunity to study this important belt in three dimensions. The drilling is just now winding up with the completion of several shallow holes and one 5-km deep borehole. Field studies of the Dabie-Sulu belt and the initial studies of borehole samples have provided many new insights into the processes involved in the subduction and exhumation of continental material and into the processes of high P - low T metamorphism; presently a hot topic in earth sciences. Specifically, the Dabie-Sulu suture zone appears to be one of the best places in the world to address the conditions under which crustal rocks are taken to depths of more than 100 km and then returned to the surface, as well as the question of how mantle rocks from depths of >200 km are transported to shallow depths and incorporated into subducted continental slabs or mountain belts. The project is the continuation of the PI's long term collaborations with Chinese colleagues who have played a major role in the drilling. The major US role involves detailed mineralogical studies of drill core samples.

For example, various types of endoscopes are used for colonoscopy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, enteroscopy, bronchoscopy, and cystoscopy. In addition, a rapidly expanding number of formerly open surgical procedures now are being converted to endoscopic procedures including resection of gallbladders, retrieval of donor kidneys, resection of tumors of colon and pancreas, correction of hiatal hernias, coronary artery bypass grafting and minimal invasive neurosurgeries. Despite a large body of knowledge in medical image analysis,  endoscopy videos are not systematically captured for real-time or post-procedure reviews and analyses. They are recorded occasionally to magnetic video-tapes (i.e., VHS). No hardware and software tools have been developed to capture, analyze, and provide user-friendly and efficient access to the medical, scientific, or educational content on such videos. This project aims to develop an Endoscopic Multimedia Information System (EMIS) to capture high quality endoscopy videos, analyze the captured videos, and provide efficient access to the  content of these videos.<br/><br/>Images of endoscopy videos significantly differ from medical still images as studied<br/>in the literature of medical image processing. The project will develop a new capturing system for endoscopy videos designed for patient's privacy and is non-disruptive to endoscopic procedures<br/>and non-restrictive to a particular endoscope vendor. New algorithms for automatic classification of informative and non-informative frames. The technique does not need any predefined parameters or thresholds. New algorithms for automatic content analysis for protruding lesions such aspolyps. Many protruding lesions are clustered together. A new region segmentation technique that can identify isolated lesions will be developed first. To handle clustered<br/>lesions, algorithms using a region pattern graph that captures important characteristics of relevant regions will be developed..<br/><br/>The proposed system will directly benefit endoscopic research, education, and training. Contributions to research-based training of graduate students who will contribute to research-based advanced training of students in graduate and undergraduate programs in computer science and medical informatics at PI and CoPI's institutions. The project will contribute to training of a new generation of computer scientists with a unique skill set supplement to traditional<br/>medical imaging. This research will enhance research opportunities for junior high and high school students participating in various university programs (UTA Summer Science Camp, Program for Women in Science and Engineering) and national programs.

0510857	Collaborative Research: Syncollisional Delamination: A Test of Crustal-scale Tectonic Wedging Exposed in the Avalon Terrane of New England	EAR	TECTONICS	07/01/2005	07/26/2005	Michael Dorais	UT	Brigham Young University	Standard Grant	David Fountain	06/30/2008	$43,605.00		dorais@byu.edu	A-285 ASB	Provo	UT	846021231	8014226177	GEO	1572	0000, OTHR	$0.00	One outstanding problem in tectonics is the mechanism of crustal thickening. Where tectonic plates converge, relatively low density crust may become delaminated from its denser mantle keel, or slices of felsic crust may indent or interfinger as crustal wedges. In this case indenting or even mutually indenting structures may lead to thickened crust. The structure of tectonic wedging has received increasing support from the interpretations of geophysical data, but interpenetrating crustal slivers have rarely been observed in the field. Consequently the mechanisms and even the confirmation of interpenetrating wedges remain speculative.<br/><br/>In this collaboration between Indiana University and Brigham Young University geologists are making one of the first attempts to directly characterize and identify the causes of syn-collisional wedging of upper crust from lower crust using surface outcrop. They have discovered an example of tectonic wedging in a tilted lower crustal profile. The outcrops in coastal Connecticut exposure rocks formerly mapped as fold nappes within the Avalon terrane. In addition to Avalonian rocks derived from juvenile sources, our pilot study of neodymium and lead isotopes is showing that the structurally lowest orthogneisses is derived from ancient crustal rocks that correlate with the Gander terrane. Their work in this region shows that Avalonian rocks both overlie Gander basement rocks and underlie rocks known to the north to rest conformably over Gander basement. Thus this map pattern defines the geometry of a tectonic wedge. <br/><br/>The goals of the project are (1) to confirm the identity and correlation of Avalon and Gander zone rocks in southern coastal New England with correlative rocks in maritime Canada where they are well characterized, (2) to test the extent and distribution of Avalon and Gander zone rocks in other inliers of New England, (3) to test single vs. double indenting models, (4) to monitor the timing and rate of approach of Avalon in the cover terranes by establishing the time of quenching of the cover Gander terranes, and (5) to assess the rheology of the rocks in the terrane boundary. Methods to be used include characterization of outcrop in the field, analysis of major and trace element compositions to identify intrusive igneous rocks, and neodymium and lead isotopic analysis of theses igneous rocks to ascertain the origins of the initial magmas.

The goal of this research is to create a theoretical foundation for maximizing availability of repairable equipment, such as, circuit breakers and transformers. Recent technology improvements in monitoring, diagnostics, communications, and controls allow for the reduced probability of service interruption and more effective maintenance practices. Still, there is a definite need to quantify the availability of equipment, optimize allocation of maintenance resources, eliminate unnecessary maintenance tasks, and improve system performance. Intellectual merit: This project will develop analytical models to evaluate the impact of maintenance on substation reliability indices by considering the criticality of equipment in a given substation. Models and algorithms based on Semi-Markov Decision Processes will be developed. These models incorporate penalties/rewards associated with different levels of maintenance activities suggested by programs such as Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) so that optimum maintenance policies and their associated costs can be determined. Broader Impact: The proposed research will contribute to the quantification of the health of electric power system infrastructure, specifically substations, since safety, reliability, quality, and costs are directly affected by the condition of systems and equipment. This project will also contribute to general knowledge in data analysis, modeling of aging processes, and development of other models representing monitoring, inspection, and maintenance activities. Such models are suitable for repairable equipment used in industries, such as, aviation, transportation, and power. Students will benefit from being exposed to practical problems of maintenance not typically encountered in the classroom.

To a human observer, the biochemical and physiological complexity of living organisms is amazing, leading some to disbelieve that such biological designs could have been accomplished by evolution alone. Considering the levels of biocomplexity found throughout nature - the development of an embryo from a single-cell; the delicate balance of an ecosystem in a rainforest; all the way to the reasoning power of the human brain, complex and elegant adaptive designs abound. As we slowly understand more details about how evolution produces such complex traits, it becomes clear that this is a powerful constructive force that we need to fully understand in order to harness its potential in solving difficult computational design problems.<br/>The twin goals of this project are to learn more about the mechanisms by which evolution produces innovative complex features, and then to apply this newfound understanding to develop a new generation of evolution-based algorithms for solving computational problems. In the process, we will use a mathematical framework for the study of complexity in biological systems to better understand the natural design process. We will start this work by answering fundamental questions in evolutionary biology and ecology including: Why do complex designs arise faster in multi-species ecosystems? If organisms have the capacity to modify their environment and communicate with one another, will this spur open-ended complexity growth? and How can we harness these forces to solve design problems?<br/>The evolving system that we use in this study is an artificial one, based on self-replicating computer programs, that nonetheless exhibit the key characteristics of natural evolving systems - most notably the ability to produce novel complex traits and innovative solutions to problems. These digital organisms exist in a user-defined computational environment, and their genomes are composed can theoretically perform any computable mathematical function. Indeed, we have witnessed a wide variety of unexpected and innovative adaptations arise through evolution in Avida. This system allows us to explore fundamental questions in evolutionary biology with speed, detail and precision that would not be possible in any natural system. Ideally it is a tool that will allow us to fully understand the origins of biocomplexity, and constructively make use of these same forces that were able to produce human intelligence in the natural world.

Besides the obvious ties of approximation algorithms to real applications, another opportunity is using methodology developed in this area to make conceptual breakthroughs in other areas. A prominent example of this is the natural linkup with the relatively new area of algorithmic game theory, which attempts to answer issues raised by the new generation of distributed systems which include the Internet, P2P systems, the web, and wireless systems.<br/>Recent exciting work on network coding also establishes strong links with approximation algorithms. Additionally, this area still retains its excitement - very basic insights are still being obtained, though at a slower rate than in the 1990's, and several fundamental problems still remain unsolved. The PI's research involves both aspects: work on the interface of areas as well as work on some fundamental problems remaining open in approximation algorithms.

This project will carry out high-resolution two-fluid simulations of AGN-heated cluster cores, including correct treatment of cosmic-ray pressure and buoyancy, turbulent mixing, and thermal conduction, as well as test-particle simulations of electron diffusion in turbulent magnetic fields, to improve previous approximate theories of thermal conduction. The investigation will rigorously test whether AGN heating solves the cooling flow problem, and will also show how to modify cluster-formation simulations to account for these two important heating mechanisms. This will lead to a better understanding of the relation between cluster masses and observables, and assist cluster surveys to constrain cosmological parameters.<br/><br/>The project includes junior researcher training, but also a major outreach effort through the University's Upward Bound Project, which targets low-income and first-generation students.

The project proposes to duplicate the function of the early visual system in a multichip neuromorphic system with two hundred and thirty thousand silicon neurons (three quarters the number of pixels in a VGA image) and three billion synaptic interactions several orders of magnitude larger than anything built to date. The outcome of this project will be SEER, a subwatt, paperback-size seeing machine.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed research stems from the tight synergy between the<br/>computational theory, based on the principle of compositionality ,and the neuromorphic implementation, based on reentrant networks. Compositionality dictates that the various parts of the vision problem should be attacked simultaneously and reentrancy gives us the capability to do exactly that.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed effort could be enormous. A multichip neuromorphic system performing multimodal segmentations would reinvigorate robotics and computer vision. By providing the infrastructure for early vision, it will facilitate the study of cognition, which will most likely generate a flood of new theories and experiments, in the Neurosciences and in the sciences of the artificial.

This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) the synthesis and characterization of stable, electron-deficient divalent silicon species; b) kinetic and mechanistic studies of proton transfer between oxygen and carbon; c) antibacterial drug discovery; d) development of Ruthenium-based olefin polymerization/small molecule activation catalysts; and e) the synthesis of dendrimers used in tissue engineering studies. <br/><br/>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in medicinal chemistry, biotechnology and polymer synthesis.

Dunn and an Intellectual Community of Public Activists<br/><br/>Intellectual Merits <br/>As a subject, geneticist L.C. Dunn (1893-1974) provides a unique portal for viewing<br/>twentieth-century history of biology and its intersection with political, social,<br/>racial, and gender issues. Dunn represents the antithesis of a common conception of the<br/>scientist as a researcher isolated from others and disengaged from controversial matters.<br/>He was, instead, a member of an active community of intellectuals united by their<br/>humanitarianism. Dunn participated in the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars, the Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom, and the American-Soviet Science Society. He worked in the Zoology Department at Columbia University from 1928 to 1962, and was affiliated with the university until his death in 1974. Among his colleagues and collaborators at this institution were geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky and anthropologist Franz Boas. Other scientists who worked with Dunn inside and outside the laboratory were geneticists Milislav Demerec and H. J. Muller, as well as physicist E.U. Condon and zoologist Julian Huxley. Dunn not only contributed to genetics through studies on mutations, evolution, and race, but also to political and social issues by using his scientific knowledge to undermine discrimination that he found abhorrent, notably eugenics, racism, and sexism. Dunn supplemented his genetic knowledge by working closely with scholars trained in other disciplines in an effort to gain a broader understanding of human evolution, heredity, and race. Dunn was also very much involved with the Soviet Union. His respect for the scientific investigations performed by Soviet geneticists encouraged him to supply the country with scientific literature and equipment after the First and Second World Wars. In the 1940s, Dunn helped Soviet geneticists to combat Trofim Lysenko's rise by enlisting American geneticists to refute Lysenko's claims. Thus, a study of Dunn is also a disciplinary history of genetics in the United States and the Soviet Union. This aspect of Dunn's life also allows us to better understand the disillusionment felt by scientists when the Soviet Union closed itself off from international cooperation in 1947-1948. In particular, it provides a new dimension to the early years of the Cold War by assessing the reaction of those previously in regular correspondence with Soviet geneticists.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>Topics that often are treated separately come together in the study of Dunn's activities. While Dunn's work focused on genetics, his interest in the topic was never far removed from research in anthropology, sociology, and the study of race. As a result a study of Dunn will incorporate and have important consequences for a wide range of the social and behavioral sciences. Nor was Dunn merely a scholar. On the contrary, he was a leading figure in a network of intellectuals who supported social and political causes. This project will be a narrative and analysis of a scientific life and community, but it will also go beyond the intellectual and social history of biology to illustrate that Dunn and many of his colleagues in the mid-twentieth century were politically engaged. The project will thus offer insights into science and social activism.

Three areas of research will be conducted; (1) Nano-twinned Cu lines with ultra-high strength and normal conductivity so that they can serve as free standing interconnects with air as the lowest k dielectric, (2) Nano-hollow SiO2 and Si3N4 particles as ultra low dielectric constant materials for Cu/ultra low k integration, and (3) Improvements in reliability of nanostructured interconnects by reducing surface electromigration. Both experimental and theoretical investigations are fully integrated in this project. In addition, Intel is our industrial partner. Education and research will be integrated by developing two graduate courses on Nano and Micromechanics and Kinetic processes in nanoscale structures. International collaborations with researchers from Germany, Taiwan, and the Ukraine have been established.

Pacuit to work with Dr. Johan van Benthem at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>Social software is an emerging interdisciplinary field devoted to the design and analysis of social procedures. First discussed by Rohit Parikh, social software has recently gained the attention of a wide range of research communities, including computer scientists, game theorists and philosophers. The main idea behind social software is that constructing and verifying social procedures should be pursued as systematically as computer software is pursued by computer scientists. Realizing this objective requires mastering techniques from the analysis of algorithms, logic of programs, logic of knowledge and game theory. Once mastered, these techniques need to be combined and reexamined from the social software point of view. Although the analogy between computer software and social software is strong, there are some important differences. For example, two issues which are important for social software but less crucial for computer software are the exchange of (and occasional hiding of) information, and the provision of incentives. Concurrency theory, cryptography and distributed computing have all addressed the first issue. However, many of the underlying assumptions in these fields makes applying these results to social procedures unrealistic. The second issue has been more or less the province of game theory. But game theory tends to study the area in rather simple terms lacking the sophisticated tools of computer science like recursion and data types. The objective of this project is to develop a formal framework for verifying social procedures, with special attention paid to naturally modeling the flow of information in a social situation.<br/><br/>Collaboration with van Benthem, Robert von Rooij and other members of the ILLC community, including Ph.D. students, will be an integral part of the success of this project. The ILLC hosts an active European research community through its regular workshops on Logic, Games and Computation.

Conlon<br/> University of Michigan <br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>This research project is concerned with partial differential equations of elliptic and parabolic type, especially equations with random coefficients. There are deep connections between equations with random coefficients and statistical mechanics, in particular particle systems. In recent work the principal investigator and co-authors have investigated connections between the one dimensional nonlinear stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrowski-Piscunov (FKPP) equation and certain particle systems. Their work introduced new techniques which, if more fully developed, should yield the proof of some conjectures of physicists concerning the wave speed of the stochastic FKPP equation. A major goal of the project is to obtain the proof of some of these conjectures. In another direction the PI plans to continue his research on linear stochastic elliptic and parabolic equations, in particular with the equations governing random walk in random environment. He has already established some unexpected connections between this problem and certain results in combinatorics related to graph connectivity. These arose in the study of the formal perturbation theory for the problem. The main goal in the current project is to prove an inequality for the effective diffusivity constant. He expects to uncover some new connections with other areas in the study of this problem also. The final part of the project is concerned with problems in partial differential equations which occur in finance. The principal investigator plans to continue working with his graduate student on a model for efficient management of an insurance company. Mathematically the problem is a problem of stochastic control theory. A satisfactory analysis of the problem will include existence and uniqueness proofs and a detailed study of the free boundary which occurs.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research project is the rigorous mathematical analysis of certain partial differential equations. These equations govern the behavior of many processes which occur in physics and engineering. During the last thirty years they have also been used in finance in the systematic study and pricing of financial instruments which depend on market volatility, such as options. The principal investigator plans to do an in depth study of some problems related to physics-engineering applications and also some problems with applications in finance. The financial application is concerned with a simple model of an insurance company which holds a risky portfolio and wants to maximize payout to investors. The physics-engineering application is concerned with understanding the dynamics of phase boundaries which occur for example in chemical reactions. Both the financial and the physics-engineering models are the simplest possible prototypes. Nevertheless, sophisticated mathematical techniques are needed to understand their basic properties.

The investigations build on an intriguing pyridinium salt photocyclization reaction, discovered nearly 30 years ago, which will be transformed into a potent methodology for the stereocontrolled synthesis of highly functionalized aminocyclopentenes. The generality of this photocyclization reaction will be probed through an exploration of the photochemistry of fused-pyridinium and polycondensed N-heteroaromatic salts. Absolute stereochemical control of the pyridinium salt photocyclization reactions by N-linked carbohydrate auxiliaries and chiral tethers will be also investigated. Stereocontrolled pyridinium salt photocyclization reactions will be used as key steps in short sequences for the synthesis of the potent trehalase inhibitor (+)-trehazoline, the proteasome inhibitor (+)-lactacystin, and the glycosidase inhibitors (+)-castanospermine, uniflorine-A and related polyhydroxylated indolizidines and quinolizidines.<br/><br/>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Patrick S. Mariano, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of New Mexico. Professor Mariano and his students are exploring light-driven (photochemical) reactions as potential tools to effect the controlled synthesis of various classes of organic molecules. The investigation concentrates on synthetic methodology development, but it is more broadly designed to address issues that relate to the synthesis of biomedically important targets and the chemistry of the high energy intermediate molecules formed in photochemical processes. General contributions will be made to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, while equally significant is the impact that the studies will have on chemical education, with this project providing a broad, comprehensive foundation for students.

To analyze and validate various hypotheses, they need to create insightful visual representations of both observed data and simulated processes. Often, insight comes from comparing multiple visualizations. But data exploration through visualization requires scientists to assemble complex pipelines consisting of sequences of operations that transform the data into appropriate visual representations, and today, this process is far from interactive. It contains many error-prone and time-consuming tasks, greatly hindering the scientific discovery process.<br/><br/>The Visualization Management System (VMS) streamlines the creation, execution, and sharing of complex visualization pipelines. It extends traditional dataflow-based visualization systems in several significant directions: it enables interactive multiple-view visualizations by simplifying the creation and maintenance of visualization pipelines, and by optimizing their execution; it provides scalable mechanisms for generating and managing a large number of visualizations; it allows systematic maintenance of data product provenance (akin to a lab notebook) and enables the automatic re-execution of visualization pipelines. VMS gives scientists more control over the visualization process, simplifying many of their day-to-day activities such as allowing them: to resume their explorations where they left off; to apply identical operations to a new data set without having to redo a long sequence of operations; or to share their findings with colleagues.<br/><br/>VMS has the potential to substantially improve scientists' ability to carry out visualization and data exploration. By making VMS freely-available and by integrating it with the leading visualization systems, it can be widely used by the scientific community to support and facilitate scientific discoveries.

The advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS) provided reliable and accurate information world wide for outdoor environments. However, many applications are emerging where position information is required and the environment or complexity considerations prohibit the use of GPS (e.g., indoor applications). As a result, areas as diverse as robotics, sensor networks, and ubiquitous computing have seen an increase in research into indoor position location. However, the majority of current work relies on laser, ultrasound, or narrowband RF for positioning. Such techniques are severely limited in harsh environments with significant multipath and/or interference. Unfortunately, many applications (e.g., emergency response, urban troop deployment, disaster relief) must deal with such harsh environments. In this research the investigators investigate an Ultra wideband-based (UWB) position location network approach which is ad hoc in nature and aims to overcome these limitations.<br/><br/>There are significant challenges associated with the development of position location networks for harsh environments. This work addresses four primary unsolved problems: (1) ranging with UWB signals in non-line-of-site environments, (2) signal acquisition of the primary path in dense multipath scenarios, (3) MAC design for UWB-based position location networks and (4) network position determination with a limited number of anchors. The research addressing these challenges uses a mixture of local signal processing methods and collaborative, network-level techniques.

Their needs are often in conflict with forest management (fire suppression, timber harvest), and the concern now is that populations in the West are declining.  Little is known about the species' population trends and genetics because studying goshawks is difficult and expensive. Goshawks, however, molt their feathers every year, which are easily collected at nest sites.  These feathers provide DNA that is useful for uniquely identifying individuals and tracking them over time.  Genetic fingerprints from molted feathers will be used to study: (1) a fifteen-year population trend for goshawks on the Kaibab Plateau, in northern Arizona; and (2) connectivity and relatedness among goshawk populations in western North America. <br/> <br/>Concern over population declines has prompted the filing of petitions to list goshawks in the West as endangered.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service cites the need for more studies to assess populations and to identify unique population segments (i.e., sub-species) that may warrant protection.  This research will provide information to guide management and conservation of goshawks.  Additionally, this research demonstrates the utility of cost-effective and non-invasive genetic methods based on molted feathers that do not require capturing and handling of animals in the wild. <br/>

In an incomplete market, as a rule, contingent claims are not replicable. In this case, arbitrage arguments alone are not sufficient to determine unique prices and, hence, more general equilibrium based (or utility based) approach has to be used. This project will study the following related topics of Mathematical Finance: The existence of second derivatives of the value function in the problem of optimal investment and the differentiability of the optimal investment strategy with respect to initial wealth; sensitivity analysis of utility based prices with respect to the number of non-traded contingent claims; the asymptotic analysis of the problems of optimal investment under small transaction costs; the equilibrium derivation of the interaction between a large economic agent and a financial market and the impact of this interaction on the prices of derivative securities. A particular attention is on the derivation of tight (ideally, necessary and sufficient) mathematical conditions for the results to hold true.<br/><br/>An important development in world financial markets over the last 25 years is the rapid broadening and expansion of derivatives markets. This became possible primarily because of the creation of the arbitrage-free pricing theory initiated by Black, Scholes and Merton. Several recent events (for example, the near-collapse of Long Term Capital Management) show, however, that the results of the arbitrage-free pricing theory should be used in practice rather cautiously as this theory does not take into account many important features of financial markets such as incompleteness, liquidity constraints, transaction costs and so on. In this project we plan to develop techniques that allow for the computation of the corrections to the arbitrage-free prices of derivatives due to different types of market imperfections.

Some human influences on animal and plant are negative and some positive. Our goal is to understand how plants, animals and humans have responded to one another's influences in tropical areas, where many people depend on the natural environment for their survival. However, use of plants and animals sometimes harms the environment and this means that it is less able to provide food, water and shelter for people. It also sometimes means that animals that help to keep plants in the area go extinct. By bringing people together from around the world, including from many tropical countries, we will learn what we know about human influences on tropical plants and animals and in turn how plants and animals influence humans. Bringing together scientists who work with plants, animals and the behavior of people, and indigenous leaders from communities who depend on the natural forests, grasslands and wet lands, may help us resolve some of the problems occurring in these areas. Our meeting should help create new ways of understanding tropical nature so that we can reduce negative influences and promote positive ones.

In arid regions, this integration is weak because erratic moisture input, high temperature and intense solar radiation reduce biological activity and compartmentalize production and decomposition processes. Our hypothesis is that fungi that are symbiotically linked to both plant and microbial producers, bridge these compartments, thereby connecting the C and N cycles. The experimental work will be conducted at grassland sites within the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR), located in New Mexico, utilizing an existing long-term ecological research (LTER) site. <br/>Arid ecosystems cover 33% of the terrestrial environment and are sensitive to N deposition and climate variation. The work will provide educational and training opportunities for three graduate and three undergraduate researchers, all of whom are individuals from groups under-represented in science. In addition, research projects at the University of New Mexico's Sevilleta LTER serve as foci for SNWR education and outreach programs with nearby local, rural school districts.

INDIANAPOLIS	IN	462568101	7574696839	ENG	1591	9149, MANU	$0.00	This Small Business Technology Transfer ( STTR) Phase II project proposes the creation of an Advanced Virtual Manufacturing Lab (AVML) for training and education on high-tech CNC machines. The key elements of the AVML are: (a) textured 3D photo-realistic virtual models of the machines and lab that include the machines' controls and moving parts; (b) semi-empirical model of the machining operation; (c) hierarchical knowledge-base for process training; (d) unstructured knowledge-base for lecture delivery; (e) natural-language human-like intelligent virtual tutors. In this phase of the research, the AVML will be completed by adding more capabilities, including 5-axis milling and collision detection between the tool and the machine, and enhancing the accuracy and completeness of the machining operation model. Furthermore, the AVML will be enhanced by incorporating Conversational Programming, different types of machine controllers, and two additional types of machines: CNC lathe and production-grade 5-axes milling machine. Pilot implementations will be conducted at a university and two community colleges. Applications of AVML include: training students to operate manufacturing machines in a safe environment, allowing students and researchers to view and interact with a near-physically accurate simulation of manufacturing machines, and optimization of the manufacturing process plan by testing various plans on the virtual machine before machining on the physical machine.<br/><br/>Manufacturing drives innovation and is a powerful engine of economic growth. However, US manufacturers face a shortage of workers to run tomorrow's factories. The AVML will enhance the quality, accessibility, and productivity of manufacturing education and training and will advance scientific discovery and engineering analysis of manufacturing processes. Also, The AVML will enhance experimentation and learning, increase student creativity and problem-solving capability, enhance collaboration among students, teachers, and industry experts, and promote participation and equal access of underrepresented groups to manufacturing technology training. Most potential manufacturing workers do not have access to state-of-the-art manufacturing labs that can provide the required training. The AVML will enable such access. This success, in turn, will strengthen US manufacturers' competitiveness and further important US national interests.

To better understand regional biogeography and vocal evolution in the Buff-throated Woodcreeper complex, the present work seeks to 1) document the geographical distribution of the two species (X. guttatus and the Cocoa Woodcreeper, X. susurrans) and four subspecies groups in this complex that occur in Venezuela, 2) determine how many evolutionary lineages are represented, 3) examine song evolution in this complex using a comparative method, and 4) assess the importance of vocalizations in the reproductive isolation of these birds. The Pis will record songs and collect specimens of woodcreepers from sites across Venezuela. These sites were chosen both to elucidate potential geographical gaps and to locate areas of contact between taxa in this group. It appears that this species complex is represented in Venezuela by evolutionary lineages that have affinities to Central America, the Caribbean, the Guianas, and Amazonia. The Venezuelan Llanos likely represents a contact zone for X. guttatus and X. susurrans, so it is key to the study of reproductive isolation in these taxa. It is likely that examination of vocal data in a phylogenetic context will reveal both rapid evolution of some vocalizations and that reproductive isolation involves more than just songs. This project represents one of few studies to examine song evolution using a comparative method and it will be the first to incorporate vocal variation within individuals.<br/><br/>Collaboration with Venezuelan institutions strengthens the research capabilities of the host country, while at the same time it provides vocal and genetic samples from a region that, despite its importance to regional biogeography, is underrepresented in studies of avian phylogeography. All specimens collected in Venezuela will be deposited at the Phelps Ornithological Collection in Caracas, and all sound recordings will be archived at the Library of Natural Sounds, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, New York, with copies remaining in Venezuela.

Remanufacturing extends the scope of traditional manufacturing and logistics activities to include forward and reverse flows as well as the corresponding forward and reverse channel activities. As a result, the traditional unidirectional supply chains need to be transformed into closed-loop supply chains. To ensure a successful transformation, this research will develop analytical models and efficient computational procedures for the optimization of network design and inventory/production planning decisions arising in the context of closed-loop supply chain systems. The results will provide analytical and computational tools for a comparison of cost and other logistical performance implications of i) alternative network design strategies, and ii) inventory/production planning policies under different seeding and product collection practices.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will broaden the theory of logistics as applied to closed-loop supply chain problems. The results are also expected to elicit insights into the efficient design and operation of closed-loop supply chains, and, hence, facilitate successful and widespread implementation of remanufacturing practices in industry. Moreover, as the research agenda has been developed in collaboration with industry, the project will foster the development of stronger interactions between the industry and academic partners.

The primary use of the cluster will be for undergraduate research training and education in the Applied Physics major, although the machine will be available for general use by the entire university. The cluster will play an integral part in the integration of research and education at CCU, and will strengthen CCU's institutional commitment toward enhancing undergraduate education through inquiry-based learning. The particular focus in the Department of Applied Physics will be on two topics: global circulation model simulations of mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere coupling and how that impacts ozone variability, and mesoscale model simulations to explore the dynamics and impacts of gravity waves.

Hess	07/31/2009	$225,872.00		m-olvera@northwestern.edu	1801 Maple Ave.	Evanston	IL	602013149	8474913003	MPS	1765	1589, 7237, 7488, 9161, AMPP	$0.00	This collaborative grant involving researchers at Wisconsin, Northwestern and Purdue has been made in response to a proposal submitted to the NSF-EC solicitation sponsored by the Division of Materials Research in coordination with the European Commission.<br/><br/>Recent experiments have shown that liquid crystalline materials are capable of probing the structure of interfaces having chemical or topographical features of nanometer length-scales. The ability of liquid crystals to detect the adsorption of proteins or viruses at surfaces or interfaces has been exploited for development of highly effective and inexpensive biological sensors. The principle of operation for these sensors is an anchoring transition of the liquid crystal material at a surface, triggered by the binding of a biological molecule or organism to a substrate. This transition leads to formation of defects, which propagate over macroscopic length scales. This cascade of defects provides the basis for a remarkable amplification mechanism, making possible the detection of a few binding events by simple optical means.<br/><br/>While the use of liquid crystals for sensing applications has been focused on solid surfaces, recent studies suggest that liquid-liquid interfaces could also be used for sensing, thereby paving the way for development of more versatile sensing devices, and development of novel technologies capable of interrogating the structure of interfaces with nanometer level resolution. For such devices and technologies to be quantitative (as opposed to purely qualitative), it will be necessary to develop a theoretical formalism capable of providing a direct correspondence between macroscopic experimental measurements (e.g. optical micrographs) and anchoring transitions and specific binding events occurring at the scale of nanometers. That formalism is inherently multi-scale, in that it must be capable of capturing anchoring transitions occurring at the level of a few liquid crystal molecules while being able to describe the formation of defects over micrometer length scales. <br/><br/>A hierarchical, multi-scale modeling approach is proposed for description of liquid-crystal based chemical and biological sensors. A diverse and unique team of scientists and engineers from the US and the EC has been assembled, all of them with complementary backgrounds and expertise. A carefully orchestrated set of modeling activities is proposed which capitalizes on the strengths of individuals and exploits synergisms between the groups of M.Olvera, J.de Pablo, I.Szleifer, M.Laso, H.Ottinger, and D.Theodorou. <br/><br/>The proposed hierarchical multi-scale approach starts from atomistic models of water, surfactant and peptide amphiphile laden interfaces, and liquid crystals. Residue-level models are used for biological molecules. These models will be coarse grained, using recently proposed methods from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The resulting coarse grain models will be fed into single-molecule and field theories to <br/>map out the structure and phase behavior of the systems of interest over wide ranges of parameter space. The theories will be used to predict the formation of nanostructured patterns at interfaces, which can subsequently be exploited to bind specific proteins and even growth factors for cell capture. The theories will also be used to provide potentials of mean force and other relevant structural information, which will <br/>be fed into field-theoretic and lattice Boltzmann descriptions of defect dynamics in liquid crystals, over macroscopic length scales both at and beyond equilibrium. Solution of these dynamic models will be implemented within the context of novel, grid-less numerical techniques. A final, global effort will consider solution of the entire multi-scale system within a micro-macro formalism that will simultaneously resolve the dynamics of molecules in effective fields and the macroscopic conservation equations.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The sensor systems envisaged in this proposal are particularly complex. They include multiple species, small and large molecules, charges, interfaces, and are often encountered in far from equilibrium situations. They exhibit a rich structural, phase and dynamical behavior that spans many length and time scales. Given this complexity, past theoretical and numerical studies have been largely <br/>limited to select, isolated elements or components of the systems considered in this proposal. There are few, if any precedents for describing the adsorption of biological molecules to peptide amphiphile and surfactant laden interfaces at a molecular level, and for describing the concomitant response of a coexisting liquid crystalline material to that adsorption process over nanoscopic and mesoscopic length <br/>scales, with full consideration of hydrodynamic effects. This proposal describes a multi-pronged, concerted plan of research that brings some of the best, state-of-the-art theory and simulation to the study of such processes. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Sensor design has become an area of central importance to science and technology. The biological sciences will benefit considerably from devices capable of detecting the occurrence of proteins in real time, medicine will benefit from faster, reliable sensors for minute amounts of proteins, and society in general will benefit from inexpensive and reliable sensors for chemical toxins and viral <br/>agents. Recent published reports indicate that the sensors to be explored in this proposal offer unusual promise on all of those fronts. Such reports also underline the fact that the usefulness and promise of liquid-crystal based sensing devices can only be fully realized by developing detailed multi-scale models and a fundamental understanding of the processes that occur in such systems over various length and time <br/>scales. The multi-scale formalism to be developed in this project will not only facilitate considerably the design and development of sensors, but will also permit development of quantitative, liquid-crystal based techniques to probe the structure and properties of interfaces.

Combining the high computational performance of specialized circuits with the re-programmability of software, these devices are quickly becoming ubiquitous. Unfortunately, if unprotected, this reconfigurability could be exploited to disrupt critical operations, snoop on supposedly secure channels, or even to physically melt a device. However, a new approach to controlling changes to the hardware logic promises to overcome these problems. In addition, the innate malleability of this hardware presents the opportunity for hardware enforcement of adaptive security policies. For example, in an emergency, trusted individuals may need to override the nominal security policy. Thus, the reconfigurable component may provide a highly trusted mechanism for secure functionality in changing environments.<br/><br/>This research aims to close a gaping security hole in our nation's information infrastructure by enhancing the logical structure and internal management of reconfigurable hardware to enforce a dynamic information protection policy. Specifically, this research will: (1) discover hardware synthesis and static validation methods that will ensure that only secure and non-destructive configurations can be loaded, (2) develop new reconfigurable structures capable of securely mediating run-time access to shared resources through the use of hardware-compiled formal access policy languages, and (3) establish a firm foundation for trustworthy dynamic policy enforcement through ontological analysis, formal modeling and the development of management mechanisms integrating the results of the first two activities.

It will explore the potential for applying new tools such as x-ray spectroscopic techniques utilizing synchrotron radiation for studying self assembled monolayers (SAM) on gold as functionalized surfaces with different chemical end groups that interact with water differently. Probing the hydrogen-bonding network in water using x-ray absorption spectroscopy will reveal how water restructures itself around different chemical terminations of the SAM overlayer. The underlying question to be addressed is how biological water differs in comparison with bulk water, and how it affects the functioning of different biomaterials. <br/><br/>Several fundamental questions of an interdisciplinary nature involving material science, chemistry and biology will be addressed. Understanding the solid-water interface is essential for many processes related to biomaterials and biological function.

This problem is fundamental to animal development, but has received relatively little attention at the molecular level. The simplicity of C. elegans and its ease of growth and manipulation makes it an ideal system for these studies. In particular, food availability during postembryonic development is simply controlled, and the worm's transparency allows developmental responses to food to be easily monitored. The proposal focuses on dissecting two genetic pathways: 1) a daf-18-mediated signaling pathway that actively controls the initiation of postembryonic development in response to food, and 2) the heterochronic gene pathway that times certain postembryonic events and is influenced by environmental conditions, including food availability. The presence of food initiates and coordinates timing of postembryonic developmental programs in diverse tissues of the worm. If nematodes are hatched in the absence of a food source, they arrest development. Work in the Rougvie laboratory indicates that DAF-18, the worm homolog of the tumor suppressor PTEN, is required for arrest of postembryonic developmental programs under starvation conditions. Components of the daf-18-mediated nutritional response pathway will be defined by testing candidate genes for involvement and by conducting genetic screens to identify novel components. Nutritional inputs also impinge upon the heterochronic gene pathway, but the mechanism by which these external signals influence timing genes is unknown. Temporal progression of postembryonic cell fates is triggered by the accumulation of the lin-4 microRNA which subsequently acts to down-regulate target genes. In the absence of food, lin-4 expression is not activated and development does not progress. In addition, another heterochronic gene, lin-42, is extremely sensitive to environmental conditions during development; its mutant phenotype is suppressed by adverse conditions. Genes will be identified that link environmental cues to the heterochronic gene pathway via lin-4 or lin-42. Broader impacts: This project will contribute to the training of a postdoctoral fellow, graduate and undergraduate students. Emphasis will be placed on developing testable hypotheses and critical interpretation of data. Past undergraduates in the laboratory have co-authored papers, and it is anticipated that undergraduate trainees supported with award will make similar contributions while conducting their research projects.

A severe gender imbalance exists within the engineering field as women currently earn about 20.1% of the bachelor's degrees in engineering. The graduation rates of female engineering majors vary across programs. <br/><br/>UI researchers will compile a national database of the approximately 344 schools with accredited undergraduate engineering programs within the United States and classify them into one of four categories based on the productivity criteria of enrollment of women and graduation of women. UI researchers will analyze institutional or departmental characteristics to identify any patterns that exist among the nation's undergraduate engineering programs, and with regard to each of the productivity categories. The institutional and departmental characteristics examined in this analysis will include such variables as institutional and program selectivity, institutional type (Carnegie classification, public/private, MSI), size of engineering program (in absolute terms and relative to home institution), graduate program offering, overall graduation rate (men and women combined), percent of female engineering faculty, and percent of female engineering students.<br/><br/>UI researchers will also carry out six to eight case studies of exemplary programs that are highly productive in terms of graduating female engineering majors. UI researchers will purposefully sample four engineering programs under the category of high enrollment and high graduation, and four under the category of low enrollment and high graduation as a comparative analysis will yield a better understanding of the relationship between enrollment and productivity. In carrying out the case studies, UI researchers will travel to selected campuses to interview departmental chairpersons, top administrators, and engineering faculty, and to conduct sex-segregated focus groups of engineering students. UI researchers will also collect information on departmental program histories and the presence of effective interventions and strategies within the program to achieve a more equitable and inviting educational environment.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is supported by the breath and depth of the project. The multi-institutional analyses will allow researchers to assess the productivity status of the country's undergraduate engineering programs on the dimensions of female enrollment and graduation. Concomitantly, the case studies enable the researchers to examine components and characteristics of effective organizational models.<br/><br/>The proposal activity will result in the broader impact of advancing the existing knowledge base about the current status of U.S. undergraduate engineering programs; approaches that result in high recruitment and retention of female engineering majors; and, organizational models of effective engineering programs for women.

To get error estimates, bootstrap is often used. This project will extend recently developed methods that dramatically reduce standard errors by considering the dependence of absorbers across different radial lines of observation, and will apply these techniques to a new larger dataset. The research work will also compare different measures of second-order structure in spatial point processes, and study methods of resampling spatial data. Extending the method to variable size absorbers, chemical element differences, and third-order characteristics, should provide clustering estimates of unprecedented precision. Analysis of surveys and simulations using various estimators should improve understanding of the procedures, and provide recommendations of appropriate measures for different situations. Resampling spatial processes is complicated and computationally intensive, and a new faster method will be tested on real data and simulations using both simple regions and more realistic, more complex regions. This work will advance statistical understanding of both theoretical and applied issues involved in estimating clustering and resampling spatial data.<br/><br/>All of these results will be important for applied statistical work in many fields, and will be disseminated as widely as possible to the statistics and astronomy communities. The research also involves significant interdisciplinary collaboration and training, including members of under-represented groups.

Williams<br/>Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine<br/><br/>The mammalian masticatory or chewing apparatus provides a window into the evolution, behavior, diet and ecology of extinct and living mammals. Previous research has tapped into each of these realms to offer adaptive, functional and biomechanical explanations of mammalian masticatory form. In this study, an integrative approach will be used to understand the relationship between form and function of the feeding apparatus in ruminating, or cud-chewing, artiodactyls using alpacas (Lama pacos) and goats (Capra hircus) as models. The dynamics of mastication and other feeding behaviors will be explored using electromyography to record the behavior of jaw muscles, strain gauge techniques to understand how the mandible and facial skeleton are loaded by external forces, and video recordings to document jaw movements produced by contraction of the jaw muscles. These data will be integrated with data on oral behaviors and with comparative anatomical and morphological data derived from dissections, histological analyses and imaging studies.<br/>A major component of this study will focus on how feeding dynamics and the anatomy of the masticatory apparatus change in concert with normal ontogenetic changes in feeding behavior and digestive physiology. As similar data are available for non-ruminating mammals, including rabbits and pigs, comparisons will be made across species to highlight possible adaptations and constraints in the development of the masticatory apparatus associated with digestive strategies. Data collected in this study will also be used to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between jaw form and growth in the context of its routine functional environment. In alpacas and goats, this functional environment consists of highly repetitive chewing behaviors associated with rumination beginning around three to four months of age, well before adult masticatory morphology is attained. Interestingly, alpacas and their close relatives differ from goats and all other ruminating artiodactyls in adult jaw morphology. In the former, the joint between the two halves of the mandible ossifies early during ontogeny whereas in the latter this joint remains patent and mobile throughout life. These differences are thought to be related to differences in loading environment of the mandible associated with adult masticatory behaviors. Thus, this study will test hypotheses regarding the role of repetitive mechanical factors in relation to differences in structure and growth of the mandible.<br/>The broader impacts of this study include additional training for the PI, a minority female scientist at the start of her post-graduate career, and interdisciplinary educational and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at two universities, Ohio (OU) and Ohio State University (OSU). These students will receive training in methodological and conceptual approaches in experimental and comparative functional morphology and biomechanics. Students will also participate in disseminating the results of this study by presenting at professional meetings and collaborating on publications for professional journals in the fields of biomechanics, evolutionary and functional morphology, and paleontology. Finally, this research program will broaden the scope of functional morphology and biomechanics training at Ohio University by contributing infrastructure and expertise for in vivo and in vitro strain analysis and by enhancing academic and research relationships between OU and OSU through this grant.

DNA self-assembly is a key tool for nano-technology, nano-robotics, and molecular computation. More generally, biological organisms are self-organized chemical systems that carry out algorithms encoded in the genetic material, DNA. Biology thus provides clear proof that autonomous chemical systems can be programmed, and that they can function reliably on a grand scale -- biological organisms can be composed of as many as 1024 molecular components!<br/><br/>Recent experimental advances in the synthesis of artificial molecular systems have demonstrated that it is possible to program molecular self-assembly to carry out rudimentary logic. These experiments also suggested that the occurrence of errors is a major obstacle to scaling up DNA self-assembly and biologically inspired computation. This project will devise algorithmic tools and analysis techniques for error-correction and error-suppression in biologically inspired self-assembling and computational systems. It is our hope that our research will facilitate sophisticated tasks such as counting, growing molecular assemblies of pre-specified sizes (no larger, no smaller), and pattern recognition of complex chemical signals using inherently error-prone biomolecular operations at the nano-scale.<br/><br/>In order to design and analyze our error-correction mechanisms, we will use high level models which are both sufficiently realistic to be useful and sufficiently abstract to be amenable to analysis. The basic elements of our models will be DNA tiles, transcriptional circuits, and DNA hybridization catalysts. Thus, our research will target assembly of and computation with large molecules such as long chains of DNA rather than smaller molecules such as proteins and amino acids.<br/><br/>We will also develop course material on the basis of our research which will be taught at Caltech and at Stanford.

The simulations will be used to<br/>help link observational data with underlying physics. The goal is to help understand the nature of<br/>the variability of different types of magnetized stars (Classical T Tauri stars, cataclysmic variables,<br/>and accreting neutron stars). With this in mind, four different activities will be undertaken: (1)<br/>simulations will be run with parameters as close to observational constraints as possible; (2)<br/>different mechanisms of variability and quasi-variability which follow from 2-dimensional and 3-<br/>dimensional numerical modeling will be investigated; (3) the light-curves from the modeled<br/>magnetized stars will be calculated and analyzed to determine the origin of different peaks in the<br/>power spectra; and (4) a program will be developed which will search for the best match between<br/>observed and modeled light curves.<br/>Included is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in complex magnetohydrodynamic<br/>physics as well as advanced programming and modeling techniques. The results obtained here will<br/>be disseminated to the public through an education/public outreach program at the local Science<br/>Museum and through a Virtual Reality  outreach program to school children and educators.

An even greater need exists for these materials for micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) assemblies earmarked for myriad applications in nanotechnology, including actuators for microwave switches and robotics and intelligent sensing and drug delivery equipment. In these applications, the miniature scale of the devices increases their surface-to-volume ratio, enhancing the likelihood that premature mechanical failure results from accidental contact of moving surfaces. To design an effective self-lubricated material, it is necessary that lubricant molecules possess high surface mobility, so that the dynamic friction coefficient of the surface is low. This requirement must be balanced against the known tendency of adsorbing substrates to slow down motion of molecules and thereby reduce their effectiveness as lubricants. The research proposed uses a combination of experiment and theory to improve current understanding of molecular mobility and lubrication properties of surface coatings possessing controlled levels of molecular disorder. The investigators propose to exploit this understanding to develop novel lubricant coatings suitable for micro and nano-sized mechanical systems. <br/>

This system responds to attacks by dynamically and selectively quarantining hosts, services, and other networked devices. Traditional containment systems based on firewalls and individual host isolation are not adequate for containing the new generation of local-scanning, topological, metaserver and contagion worms that can spread very quickly through an enterprise. Further, these systems do not provide enterprise-wide protection of essential services during such quarantine. To address these shortcomings, a comprehensive enterprise defense framework, called SeQuEN (Service Quarantine in Enterprise Networks) is being developed, implemented and evaluated. SeQuEN automatically identifies hosts, routers and switches forquarantine based on their service interactions (behaviors) instead of the physical topology of the network. Since most viruses and worms target specific services and the underlying vulnerabilities, the service-centric quarantine in SeQuEN is expected to achieve fast containment of malicious attacks. Further, SeQuEN enhances the survivability of an operational network by maintaining essential services when a network-wide quarantine is activated upon attack detection. This is achieved by partitioning the service topology into a number of quarantine zones while providing service distribution and replication. SeQuEN is also being integrated within an Attack Simulation Engine (ASE) to simulate different types of malicious code attacks, such as topological, local-scanning worms and spybots. The effectiveness of the quarantine algorithms in SeQuEN is being evaluated using network traces collected from a class-2 IP network.

The three primary goals of the project are: (1) to<br/>elucidate the mechanism of current rectification at pn junctions based on conjugated<br/>ionomers; (2) to elucidate the mechanism of steady-state rectification in a new class of<br/>heteroionic junctions formed between an undoped anionic and cationic ionomer; (3) to<br/>explore a non-traditional method of doping conjugated polymers that relies on non-<br/>Faradaic processes. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive suite of electrical and<br/>electrochemical characterization methods are applied to study a series of rationally<br/>designed polymer bilayer structures. These studies are complemented by studies on<br/>single layer structures and rely heavily on the availability of a family of conjugated<br/>ionomers or varying ionic functional group density. The results of the characterization<br/>methods are to be compared to both theories developed for inorganic semiconductor<br/>analogues as well as those developed for molecular systems.<br/>The broader impacts of the proposal stem from better understanding the relation<br/>of polymeric to inorganic semiconductors as well as the unique properties of interfaces<br/>between mixed ionic/electronic conductors. In doing so, these studies will help guide the<br/>future development of electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as transistors and lightemitting<br/>diodes, based on conjugated polymers. The project will also impact the training<br/>of both undergraduates and graduate students in the basic science of materials. Graduate<br/>students working on the project will be part of a comprehensive training program that<br/>integrates chemists and physicists and includes targeted technical training in the area of<br/>semiconductor devices as well as off-campus internships. A broad range of<br/>undergraduates will be reached by the project both through their contributions to research<br/>and through curriculum development. A new non-majors undergraduate course will be<br/>developed that teaches basic chemical and physical principles using everyday materials<br/>and the devices upon which they are based as a context.

Nevertheless the numerical solution of three-dimensional<br/>PDEs is a critical bottle-neck that prevents this potential from being realized. This proposal<br/>advances techniques that can be used to overcome this bottle-neck. Discretized elliptic PDEs are normally solved by iterative schemes since the fill-in during sparse Gaussian elimination is excessive. This proposal observes that the fill-in, in a certain ordering, has low numerical rank in the off-diagonal blocks, and that this structure can be computed and exploited to construct direct solvers that are linear in the number <br/>of unknowns. The outcome of the proposed research has the potential to create a novel class of pre-conditioners that in conjunction with iterative solvers can become powerful weapons for solving difficult elliptic PDEs.<br/>The intellectual merit of the proposal stems from the complicated structure in the fill-in that<br/>must be first inferred from regularity results for Green's functions in elliptic PDE theory and then<br/>converted into effective linear-time algorithms to both capture the structure on the fly during sparse<br/>Gaussian elimination, and then exploited to speed up the very same Gaussian elimination. The impact of the proposal will be to provide new solvers for difficult PDEs. In particular thesoftware that is developed will be made available to the community, and should enable scientists and engineers to have a new tool for their difficult problems. It will also infuse fresh ideas into the field of sparse direct solvers and unify it with the field of iterative methods.

Process technicians monitor and control industry equipment and processes. The process technician position has become much more complex in recent years, requiring more knowledge and skills in computing, teamwork, problem solving, regulatory compliance, and troubleshooting. Compounding the problem is the abnormally high number of retirements projected over the next 7 to 10 years in these industry sectors. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Labor projects growth in the oil and gas exploration and production and pharmaceutical industry sectors. Companies must have qualified workers who possess the skills and knowledge needed to perform successfully in this advanced job. Global competitiveness of process industries depends on the availability of quality education programs and student access to these educational opportunities. <br/><br/>The Center for the Advancement of Process Technology (CAPT) was formed in 2002 as a national collaboration between education and industry in six process technology alliances - Alaska Process Industry Careers Consortium, Greater New Jersey Process Technology Alliance, Gulf Coast Process Technology Alliance, Louisiana Process Technology Alliance, Oklahoma Partnership of Industry and Education, and Southern California Chemical Technology Alliance. These alliances include industry partners in the chemical, refining, exploration and production, and pharmaceutical sectors such as BASF, BP, Chevron Texaco, ConocoPhillips, Dow Chemical, DuPont, Eastman Chemical, ExxonMobil, Lyondell-Citgo Refining, Merck, Oklahoma Gas and Electric and Shell. The Center has 39 national education partners in 18 states and the Virgin Islands and 3 international education partners. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The mission of CAPT is to support the ongoing development of a highly skilled, educated and diverse process technician workforce. CAPT fosters the development and enhancement of quality two-year degree programs based on industry-established standards. In 2002, partners identified the top 10 critical issues facing process technology education. To address these critical issues, CAPT focuses on 5 primary goals:<br/>1. Develop curricula and instructional materials to support process technology education.<br/>2. Provide professional development opportunities for community college and high school faculty who prepare students for careers in the process industries.<br/>3. Support program development and improvement to serve student and industry needs.<br/>4. Establish and foster partnerships linking industry, education, and government to advance process technology education.<br/>5. Provide organizational and fiscal development to assure CAPT's health and<br/>sustainability.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: CAPT has worked with partners during the past three years to address key critical issues. A recent needs analysis confirmed that partners are satisfied with activities conducted as solutions for a subset of identified critical issues. In response to partners, CAPT is expanding and strengthening previously established activities. CAPT is also implementing new activities that build upon previous experiences.

The hypothesis is that resistivity of such polymer wires are affected by sorption of electrolytes from the water and that ions with different mobilities would alter the electrical conductivity of the polymer in different ways. The work involves three objectives: fabrication of aqueous nanowire sensors, electrical characterization of the nanowires, and development of nanowire electrical contacts and dual sensors based on nanowire concepts. The study will evaluate whether polymer-based nanowires are more versatile than modified metal or ceramic nanowires and more affordable to manufacture. Understanding the behavior of polymer nanowires could lead to the development of many kinds of novel sensors and control options.

There now exists a set of libraries from well known non-chordate deuterostome species and functionally characterized candidate genes which comprise one of the most comprehensive experimental platforms ever assembled to address these questions. Compared to the reference species Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, the six comparable species' divergence times span from 20 to 540 million years. Candidate genes have been previously analyzed by gene transfer in the reference species and experimental and computational tools have been developed to undertake these comparative studies. From 8 candidates will be gathered the sequences of putative cis-regulatory modules at varying evolutionary distances. These will be compared to gauge the quality and quantity of changes that have occurred and their function will be verified using gene transfer of large-insert recombinant reporter constructs in the reference species. Besides supporting a theory of cis-regulatory module sequence evolution, the rules that emerge from these mechanisms will provide better predictive methods for discovering cis-regulatory modules in genomes where little previous experimental data is available. <br/>Broader Impacts<br/> Understanding how cis-regulatory modules evolve lies at the nexus of several major questions in modern biology. The mechanisms operating here will help explain us how the genome works, how development works and how evolution works. The application of the principles learned here will be disseminated through the usual academic channels including journal publications, meeting presentations, graduate and undergradate teaching, and books.<br/> The PI and Co-PI have a history of involving undergraduates in laboratory research through the Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF), often funded by REU supplements to NSF grants. Additionally, the PI routinely serves on SURF ad hoc review boards. The training of graduate and post-doctoral personnel is an important component of the operation of the Davidson Laboratory, the Center for Computational Regulatory Genomics and the Genome Facility.

In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, two O-GlcNAc transferases, SECRET AGENT (SEC) and SPINDLY (SPY), are responsible for this modification. Genetic studies indicate that O-GlcNAc modification of a gibberellin (GA) signaling pathway component negatively regulates the plant's response to this hormone. DELLA proteins also negatively regulate GA responses and genetic studies suggest that O-GlcNAc modification of DELLA proteins is required for this regulation. SEC produced in bacteria modifies RGA, a DELLA protein, within a proposed regulatory region. Additionally preliminary evidence suggests that another arabidopsis DELLA protein, GAI, is O-GlcNAc modified. Thus it is hypothesized that O-GlcNAc modification activates RGA and GAI. This research will test the hypothesis by determining if RGA and GAI are O-GlcNAc modified in plants and characterizing the activity of mutant proteins that cannot be modified. While O-GlcNAc modification is essential for gamete and embryo viability and plays a role in a number of signaling pathways, knowledge of the identities of the modified proteins is extremely limited. The second goal of this project will address this deficiency by identifying additional O-GlcNAc modified proteins and mapping the modifications. The amount of O-GlcNAc modification to animal proteins is responsive to environmental conditions and hormonal signals and these changes are believed to regulate the activity of the modified proteins. To understand the role of O-GlcNAc modification in plants, it is important to be able to determine the effects of different treatments on the abundance of an O-GlcNAc modified protein. Therefore, this research will develop methods to quantitate the abundance of specific O-GlcNAc modified proteins. <br/> High school, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained by performing portions of this research. Some of these students will be recruited from U of MN summer programs that provide laboratory research experiences for high school students, teachers and undergraduates. Interest in science in high school students will be stimulated by giving tours of the laboratory and presentations to students and teachers. In addition to contributing to learning, the project will contribute to the dissemination of knowledge by creating and maintaining a website containing information on O-GlcNAc modification in plants. The research will contribute to scientific infrastructure by providing a new method for quantitating O-GlcNAc modified proteins.

Main St, Suite 710	Durham	NC	277054010	9196843030	CSE	7353	9184, BIOT	$0.00	There has been considerable recent progress demonstrating a class of DNA molecular-effectors called DNA walkers that execute various forms of biped locomotion along self-assembled linear DNA nanostructures. In particular, the walker constructed by Reif's group at Duke is the ?rst DNA walker that executes autonomously, without external intervention. This project will extend the emerging nanotechnology of DNA walkers to provide a programmable network system for molecular transport and communication within self-assembled DNA lattices. Our system will perform a set of communication and transport operations. These include, among other things, the ability to (i) perform a class of ?nite state operations on the information provided by speci?ed sites of the 2D lattice, (ii) route ?nite state information and/or nanoparticles to and from pairs of tiles of the DNA lattice or to other specified sites. Although the degree of programmability of the proposed constructs is restricted to ?nite state transitions, still the programmability far exceeds current experimental demonstrations of current molecular effectors and molecular-motor devices. We intend to make significant improvements to Duke's existing autonomous DNA walkers to allow them to have far more impact to nanoscience and nanotechnology, including extending the DNA walkers to be programmable in at least two senses: (a) They will be made to route to target sites following paths embedded in the 2D DNA lattices (in contrast, prior DNA walkers traversed only linear DNA nanostructures). (b) The DNA walkers will be able process information embedded along its path and perform finite state operations on the sequence of information it encounters. We will also self-assemble for the first time fully addressable two dimensional DNA lattices, on which the programmable paths of the walkers will be defined. We will also extend the DNA walkers to nano-transport devices: that is, (a) to transport a variety of types (e.g., metallic particles and proteins) of nano-particles, (b) to pick up and unload nano-particles at specific sites on the DNA lattice, and (c) to cooperatively carry a DNA lattice as a load. These much improved DNA walkers will be of two types: (a) One type is an extension of previous autonomous walkers developed at Duke and is based on protein enzymes; (b) the other type is made purely of nucleic acids and does not use protein enzymes. In addition to the design and computer simulation of these improved DNA walkers, the proposed work includes a series of experimental demonstrations of isolated capabilities of DNA walkers as listed above, as well as experimental demonstrations of general operations such as lattice-wide transporting/processing of information and transporting of material. <br/>The proposed work is inherently cross-disciplinary and will impact multiple ?elds including chemistry, biochemistry, physics, computer science, and robotics, with potential long-term applications in nano-engineering and possibly in areas of biomedical interests. It will provide exciting and challenging interdisciplinary training opportunities for Duke graduate and undergraduate students. This project will provide a transition from the existing simple nano-effectors to programmable nano-robotics network system, yielding capabilities that have broad impact to nano-engineering. There are numerous feasible practical applications of our proposed autonomous programmable molecular transport network. For example, such a programmable nano-particle transport system might be used in the future for constructing complex assemblies of various nano-electronic devices attached to specified sites on the DNA lattice and for detecting/processing/broadcasting molecular signals.

The subject becomes increasingly important as the world, as well as national security threats, become more mobile. This project is investigating the issues related to the design and development of innovative methods for querying, analyzing, and mining of spatiotemporal information to find typical characteristics of the moving objects' trajectories, and uncover suspicious motion in large datasets of moving objects. The moving objects datasets are in the form of either stored data or transient data streams. The project is designing and implementing the MotionEye system prototype which consists of four subsystems: MotionQuest(DB) and MotionQuest(Stream) for querying and hypothesis validation in moving objects databases and data streams respectively, and MotionMine(DB) and MotionMine(Stream) for data mining in moving objects databases and data streams respectively. The project is investigating efficient and effective approaches to the implementation of these subsystems. The project is also striving to ensure that the developed technology will not sacrifice individual privacy. The project will enable the development of more advanced information systems in homeland security, law enforcement, traffic control, and other domains that deal with moving objects.

The central hypothesis is that insecurity and lack of access to a democratic rule of law create conditions that threaten the preservation of democracy in societies recently transformed from authoritarian governance. The research hypothesizes that personal security correlates with tolerance for basic democratic principles and human rights, and that urban residents of Cochabamba, Bolivia who lack personal security are more likely to adopt violent remedies to address their situations than are those who have access to other ways to ensure security. Using ethnographic methods of investigation (including participant-observation, focus groups, and personal interviews), the research compares the responses of residents of three different communities in Cochabamba, all of whom lack access to official justice, but who have compensated for this lack in three different ways: by employing private security firms; by maintaining a system of community justice brought through migration from the countryside; and by resorting to vigilante violence. It hypothesizes that in the two communities that have developed non-violent alternatives to compensate for the lack of official policing and judicial services, tolerance for democracy and human rights will be greater than in the community that employs vigilante violence as a crime-control measure. <br/> Broader Impacts: The new knowledge produced by this research will be useful to governments and planners concerned with improving the democratic transition, to support not only formal democratic measures like elections but the implementation of a rule of law in newly democratic societies, and so reduce the violence and insecurity with which so many of the world's people now live.
0504905	Collaborative Research: Multimedia Database of Ixil Mayan Narratives	BCS	LINGUISTICS	07/15/2005	07/08/2008	Melissa Axelrod	NM	University of New Mexico	Standard Grant	Joan Maling	06/30/2009	$29,152.00		axelrod@unm.edu	1700 Lomas Blvd. NE, Suite 2200	Albuquerque	NM	871310001	5052774186	SBE	1311	0000, 9150, OTHR, 7719	$0.00	It is a sad truth that the endangerment of a language often also implies the endangerment of a population. This is true in the case of Ixil, a Mayan language spoken by entire communities only in the highlands of northern Guatemala. The remaining approximately 65,000 speakers of Ixil are the survivors of a genocidal attack upon the Ixil people that took place in the 1980s during the Guatemalan civil war. This project will serve to document not only the Ixil language but also the important social context of the survival of the Ixil people. The product of this documentation project will be a web-based, multimedia database of Ixil conversations, narratives, and oral histories containing text versions of the narratives along with voice and video files. Different programming features will render the database accessible in several formats including: 1) a technical version containing morphological and syntactic analysis of the texts intended for linguists, anthropologists, historians and others interested in the scholarly examination of the Ixil language; 2) a version intended for native speakers, teachers, and learners of Ixil, useful as the basis for curriculum for the Ixil communities' literacy and history classes for children and adults; and 3) a dictionary of the words used in the narratives. A research team consisting of Dr. Jule Gomez de Garcia, Dr. Melissa Axelrod, and graduate student Maria Luz Garcia will gather the narratives in Nebaj, El Quiche, Guatemala, and surrounding communities. Members of an Ixil women's cooperative will assist in the transcription and analysis of the narrative and conversational materials. <br/><br/>In addition to providing documentation for the Ixil community, this product will increase understanding of the conversation and discourse structures of Ixil and provide a rich database for students of Mayan languages and cultures in general. This information will also contribute to aspects of linguistic theory dealing with an understanding of the range and parameters of linguistic structures and behaviors as they reflect human cognitive functions. The practical benefits from this research are the inclusion of university students and members of indigenous communities in the development and practice of methodologies for documenting endangered languages.

This proposal will investigate situations in which answering questions in complexity require us to understand specific algorithmic problems, and designing efficient algorithms require us to answer questions in complexity. Recently, there have been several results that expose the connection between complexity and algorithms. Examples include the connections between algebraic circuit lower bounds and polynomial-identity testing, better exponential algorithms for _ -SAT and circuit lower bounds, limitations of widely used backtracking algorithms and proof complexity, and constructions of error-correcting codes and constructions of pseudorandom generators. The proposed work will elaborate on these connections between combinatorial constructions, efficient algorithms, and complexity. It will use these connections to further our understanding of both algorithms and complexity. It will also seek new connections in the study of randomness in computing, proof complexity, the exact complexity of N P-complete problems, and formal models of algorithm paradigms.<br/><br/>This proposal will investigate issues where algorithm design is key to new results in complexity. Such issues include:<br/>_<br/>Which instances of optimization problems are the most intractable ones? Exactly how difficult are these problems?<br/><br/>What are good heuristic methods for solving optimization problems? When and how well do they work?<br/><br/>Can we distinguish between the powers of various general algorithmic methods (e.g., dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, back-tracking, local search, linear-programming relaxation) for solving these problems?<br/><br/>How much does randomness help in solving problems?<br/><br/><br/>What is the relationship between the theory of sub exponential time algorithms and fixed parameter tractability? What other consequences would the existence of sub exponential algorithms have for complexity and cryptography?<br/><br/>While complete answers to most of these questions will probably not be possible in the foreseeable future, researchers in complexity, including the PIs, have made substantial progress on all of them. In particular, it is becoming apparent that these questions are so interrelated that it is impossible to address any one issue in isolation. Instead, success will require a multi-pronged effort that reveals the interconnections, and uses progress in one direction to obtain similar progress on others.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Search and optimization are central to any computational issue in science and engineering. For example, finding the most probable folding of a protein, finding the smallest area of a VLSI chip, and finding the optimal way to classify data are all combinatorial optimization problems. The same algorithmic techniques are used to solve such problems in a wide variety of application domains. However, many of these techniques are heuristic in that factors that determine the performance are not well understood. This is more than academic issue since the lack of understanding prevents users from matching application areas to the most suitable algorithmic techniques. The work in this proposal is intended to further this   understanding and hence may indirectly lead to improvements in many diverse application domains.<br/>This proposal will also train graduate students to be top researchers and educators like many of our alumni.<br/>1<br/><br/>

Software engineering educators, however, hesitate in adopting service-learning projects because projects from community partners with different backgrounds and needs are often dramatically different and are not as well structured as traditional academic projects. It is difficult to 1) manage in one class different projects that require entirely different toolsets, languages, platforms, and even have different timelines; 2) evaluate different projects from different community partners and give consistent grades; 3) ensure that service learning projects proposed by community partners are interesting and beneficial to them and in the meantime appropriate for the class with respect to scope, size, and difficulty; and 4) facilitate the adoption of cross-term, cross-team projects to accommodate community partners in need of larger projects. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: To overcome these challenges, Ohio University is developing an educational software process named GROw (Gradually Ripen Open-source Software) that facilitates cross-term, cross-team project development. In addition, OU is developing consistent grading rubrics for different projects and guidelines to assist community partners to provide appropriate project requirements. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. While the open-source approach has been proven effective and scalable in practice, the impacts of this approach on software engineering courses have not been fully studied. This project is pioneering a systemic way to apply the open-source approach on large, multi-term service-learning projects. Through service learning, this project is providing benefit to participating community partners and helping to produce educated software engineers who have a stronger sense of civic responsibility.

In light of the fast growing data deluge in science, engineering, industry and society, recognition systems must be able to operate without human supervision. This poses new challenges: How can one learn automatically models of a large number of object classes from unlabelled images? How can one represent these object classes such that they can be searched efficiently? How can one leverage the learnt models to learn new object classes from very few examples?<br/><br/>It is proposed that these challenges may be met by inferring hierarchical representations of object classes from unlabelled image data. Object classes are represented as constellations of parts, where each part extracts shape and appearance information.<br/>Non-parametric Bayesian techniques may be employed to organize these object classes into tree-structured representations. The richness of this representation grows incrementally as more data is presented to the system. New similarity measures between object classes naturally derive from this representation facilitating recognition.<br/><br/>Outreach to the local community is established through a collaboration with the California State University Northridge where students, often minorities who are the first in the family to obtain a university degree, will have the opportunity to engage in visual recognition problems proposed by and relevant to local companies.

This will be accomplished by performing static compression sink/float experiments in piston-cylinder and multi-anvil devices at pressures from 0.5 to 20 GPa. The sink/float technique has been used by this group in previous studies to determine high-pressure density and compressibility of anhydrous liquids that include peridotite, komatiite, terrestrial and lunar basalt, and Fe2SiO4. This study will build on this database and extend it to hydrous compositions by investigating these same liquids with added H2O. The proposed measurements will give new insight into the structure and physical properties of hydrous silicate liquids, and the mobility of water-bearing magmas in the Earth's mantle. Hydrous silicate liquid isothermal bulk moduli (KT) and the pressure derivative (K'), once established by these experiments, can then be applied to determine if equilibrium crystal-liquid density inversions exist during wet melting of the mantle.<br/><br/>There is a growing realization that mantle magmatism, both primordial and recent, may frequently happen in the presence of water. This phenomenon could affect a wide range of the Earth's interior processes, from shallow crustal levels to the deep region at the boundary between the mantle and core. The main focus of this study is determine if there are regions in the Earth where certain magmas with dissolved water, also called hydrous silicate liquids, will become trapped or even sink, rather than rising buoyantly to the surface. We know from earlier experimental studies that some magmas, without water, become negatively buoyant at high pressure and can sink deep in the interiors of the Earth and the Moon, but this has never been determined for water-bearing or hydrous magmas. Therefore, this is to be one of the first systematic studies to determine the density and compressibility of hydrous silicate liquids at high pressures and temperatures in the laboratory that recreate conditions of magmatism in the Earth's mantle.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the following programs: Petrology and Geochemistry, and Geophysics programs in the Division of Earth Sciences (GEO) together with the EPSCoR program (EHR).

Even though divergence-measure fields can be interesting solely from the analytical point of view, the main motivation to study them is to advance our understanding of entropy solutions for nonlinear conservation laws. It was proven by Glimm that the one-dimensional system of strictly hyperbolic conservation laws has a global entropy solution in the space of functions of bounded variation, assuming that the initial data has sufficiently small total variation. However, when the initial data is large or the system is not strictly hyperbolic (especially for the multidimensional case), then the solution u is generally a signed Radon measure or a L^p-function. Understanding more properties of divergence-measure fields will advance our understanding of entropy solutions for nonlinear conservation laws.<br/><br/>Divergence-measure fields have been studied by authors including Ambrosio, Anzellotti, Chen-Frid, Chen-Torres and Ziemer. However, there are still many open questions concerning their analysis, especially for the case of unbounded vector fields. Thus, the principal investigator will study analytical properties of divergence-measure fields including normal traces and Gauss-Green formulas for unbounded divergence-measure fields, over sets of finite perimeter. The principal investigator will also apply the theory of divergence-measure fields to the development of a general framework for the Cauchy flux over oriented surfaces that are boundaries of sets of finite perimeter. This very general framework will allow to capture measure-valued production density in the formulation of the balance law and entropy dissipation for entropy solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws. The study of multidimensional conservation laws, both scalar equations and systems, is currently the subject of significant research effort. The investigation of hyperbolic systems in many dimensions (and even in the one-dimensional case) is motivating the search for new analytical tools that could bring some insight to these difficult equations. The principal investigator intends to use geometric measure theory techniques to study certain hyperbolic conservation laws.

The empirical investigation for HCI examines how a display wall changes user's perceptive and cognitive work patterns with visual data, and how these effects can be leveraged to increase user effectiveness in a variety of domains. This knowledge is then used to improve user efficiency through tailored interaction methods and user interfaces for display walls. For the latter, the high-resolution capabilities of the display wall in visualization and biomedical imaging are exploited. This application dove-tails the recent acquisition of a 3T MRI for the purpose of analyzing cognitive processes during problem solving.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Housed in the Institute for Neurocognitive Science and Technology (INST), the equipment will contribute to provide graduates hands-on training in its use, capabilities, and limitations. The research training and outreach efforts utilizing the wall would educate students and the community in the technology and the ongoing research efforts at the university.

Nodulated, nitrogen-fixing legumes produce bioavailable nitrogen, which is one characteristic that make legumes second only to the cereals in their importance to human nutrition. Symbiotic nitrogen fixing root nodule development is a complex process requiring coordination of both the plant host and rhizobial symbionts' differentiation pathways. In previous collaborative work between the Dickstein and Sherrier laboratories, two Medicago truncatula plant mutants, nip (numerous infections with polyphenolics) and sli (sluggish infections) defective in the rhizobial infection/invasion process were identified and partially characterized. The current work seeks to define the molecular and cellular defect underpinning these mutations. The intellectual merits of this project include: (1) cell biological analyses of mutants to facilitate the map-based cloning of the nip, and (2) characterization of sli with cell biological approaches. The broader impacts of the project include examination of important aspects of the basic biology of nodule development, IT growth and symbiosome formation, which have previously been difficult to study. The results of this research might lead to new strategies to improve the efficiency of nodulation and nitrogen fixation. Other broader impacts include the training of a postdoctoral fellow, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Additionally, both Drs. Dickstein and Sherrier's groups are involved in several outreach programs at their respective universities that recruit non-mainstream undergraduate students, underrepresented minority undergraduate students, high school teachers in the summer, and high school students to their respective laboratories.

Nevertheless the numerical solution of three-dimensional PDEs is a critical bottle-neck that prevents this potential from being realized. This proposal advances techniques that can be used to overcome this bottle-neck. Discretized elliptic PDEs are normally solved by iterative schemes since the fill-in during sparse Gaussian elimination is excessive. This proposal observes that the fill-in, in a certain ordering, has low numerical rank in the off-diagonal blocks, and that this structure can be computed and exploited to construct direct solvers that are linear in the number of unknowns. The outcome of the proposed research has the potential to create a novel class of pre-conditioners that in conjunction with iterative solvers can become powerful weapons for solving difficult elliptic PDEs.<br/>The intellectual merit of the proposal stems from the complicated structure in the fill-in that must be first inferred from regularity results for Green's functions in elliptic PDE theory and then converted into effective linear-time algorithms to both capture the structure on the fly during sparse Gaussian elimination, and then exploited to speed up the very same Gaussian elimination. The impact of the proposal will be to provide new solvers for difficult PDEs. In particular thesoftware that is developed will be made available to the community, and should enable scientists and engineers to have a new tool for their difficult problems. It will also infuse fresh ideas into the field of sparse direct solvers and unify it with the field of iterative methods.

The objective of the proposed research is to establish an atomistic understanding of the interactions of nanostructured polymers with the plasmas and energetic beams used during pattern transfer, and to identify the molecular design parameters and plasma processing parameters required to control patterning at nanoscale dimensions. A strong motivation for this proposal is the recognition that molecular design of organic materials for emerging nanolithographic approaches based on soft lithography and self-assembly is not constrained by the requirement for transparency at short optical wavelengths. This profound change provides the opportunity to design organic masking materials for greatly enhanced stability in plasma environments. The approach is to bring together an interdisciplinary team of academic and industrial researchers, who, through their combined expertise and research capabilities are positioned to significantly advance the cutting edge of controlled nanoscale patterning of materials. This includes design and synthesis of organic imaging materials; nanostructuring the materials using soft lithography and self-assembly, exposing the organic molecules to highly controlled and well-characterized plasma environments and energetic beams, and characterizing and simulating the changes of the chemistry, structure and topography induced by these interactions. <br/><br/>Successful completion of the project tasks will enable design of new nanoscale imaging materials with enhanced chemical and structural stability in plasma/energetic beam environments and will lead to the development of advanced plasma equipment\processes. These are prerequisites to controlled precision patterning of materials at the nanoscale, which is one of the critical foundations of future nanotechnological manufacturing. The interdisciplinary character and inter-dependence of the various research tasks along with the university-industry collaboration of this NIRT project provide unique educational opportunities for the students, post-doctoral fellows, faculty and industrial researchers involved, and will be used to enhance class-room based teaching.

Glinert	08/31/2006	$17,000.00		rba@drexel.edu	1505 Race St, 8th Floor	Philadelphia	PA	191021119	2158955849	CSE	6845	9218, HPCC	$0.00	Threaded event networks are hypertext-like structures which the PI has previously explored in three domains (science education, narratives, and digital preservation) employing distinct but related formalisms: qualitative causal maps, plot units, and role-activity diagrams. While these formalisms appear to be generally effective, they are considerably more complex than simple node-and-link hypertext. Moreover, event networks are often associated with text passages and are often intended for educational uses where repeated navigation through the network following different paths is to be expected. In these contexts, ease of user access is crucial in order for the formalisms to be effective for users. In this project, the PI will extend his work on threaded event scenarios to address interface issues and develop supporting navigational landmarks, by applying composite hypertexts to complex domains to further develop timeline toolkits that his earlier work have created or suggested. He will develop more interactive and adaptive presentations, which allow users to branch from established guided tours within the event networks, and which, as the users gain greater familiarity with the network, enable adjustment of the landmarks that are presented to provide context for the users. Authors and other users will also be able to add annotations, and even structured meta-comments, to the event networks, for which dialog management and rhetorical structures will be supported. The PI will conduct three levels of evaluations: for the low-level tools, for the use of the tools in high-level tasks, and as the basis for developing communities discussing science and history. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Because discussion of causation is so common in areas as diverse as science and history, tools to highlight and explore event networks potentially have a wide range of applications. These tools should help students to develop richer conceptual understanding of events in science and history. The tools may also be used by the public to create discussion sites about history, and they should be useful for practicing scientists, historians, archivists, and genealogists.
0517878	Nutrition security in context of migration in Southern Province, Zambia	BCS	CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY	07/01/2005	02/25/2008	Deborah Crooks	KY	University of Kentucky Research Foundation	Standard Grant	Deborah Winslow	06/30/2009	$105,375.00	Lisa Cliggett	dlcrooks@uky.edu	109 Kinkead Hall	Lexington	KY	405260001	8592579420	SBE	1390	0000, 9150, 9179, OTHR, SMET	$0.00	Despite decades-long programs aimed at alleviating malnutrition around the world, rates remain high, and are even escalating among some populations. The people of sub-Saharan Africa are at particular risk as a consequence of livelihood insecurity, and in Zambia malnutrition rates among children under the age of five are high, with 47% stunted, and 27% underweight, placing them at life-long risk for physical and cognitive impairment. Guided by theories of human adaptability and political economy, and grounded in nutritional anthropology framework, this research aims to elucidate relationships between the human environment (in ecological, social, political and economic contexts) and nutritional outcome in context of rural-to-rural migration, a form of migration that is increasing but is little studied with respect to nutrition and health outcomes. The hypothesis is that migrants will opportunistically construct diverse livelihood strategies based on their ability to take advantage of local opportunities, with variable success measured via nutritional outcome. Specific aims of the research are to: (1) use existing data and data to be collected to ascertain livelihood strategies and assess continuity and change in livelihood strategies and nutritional status between Gwembe Tonga in the sending and receiving communities; (2) identify and assess linkages among available resources, livelihood strategies, food security, health security and nutritional status; and (3) assess the role of age, gender and household position in the relationship between livelihood strategies and nutritional status, both between and within households. The research includes fieldwork over two years by two senior colleagues and students, and leverages from on-going research on tenure security and sustainability, and 50 years of research on continuity and change among the Gwembe Tonga. It utilizes an exploratory quantitative/qualitative design that is primarily ethnographic, but employs methods from cultural and biological anthropology, and nutrition research, including participant observation of daily life, semi-structured interviews focusing on domains of food, health, and economic activities, and anthropometric measurements of children and adults. Data analysis will link individual livelihood strategies to nutritional outcome, and provide rich description of the context in which strategies are formed, including the availability and constraints on resources, and how and why adaptive decisions are made and activities carried out. The research will add to a body of work on the nutritional consequences of changing livelihood strategies, combining social/cultural/ecological elements with biological/nutritional elements; focusing intently on within-group variation; and utilizing several levels of analysis, from individual to international. Its focus on adaptive success in achieving nutrition security will have direct policy implications. Its broader impacts include advancing education by incorporating graduate students in all phases of the research, including connection to an NSF sponsored field school in data collection methods; building on existing Zambian/U.S. collaborative networks, and establishing new ones for future research on health and nutrition in rural Zambia; and providing opportunities for local Zambians to develop and build skills useful to their own personal and professional development.

Specifically, the oscillatory patterns are generated by a spatially distributed array of weakly coupled dynamical systems, where the coupling is predominantly local, with perhaps a few long range interactions. Additionally, some of the dynamical systems in the network are driven by external inputs which modulate the spatiotemporal signal generated by the entire network.<br/><br/>The pattern generating circuit would be implemented in an array of MEMS (micro electro mechanical systems), in an array of coupled LASERS and in an array of coupled NEURONS. Each of the three arrays is well known for their ability to generate oscillatory patterns. For example, in the visual cortex of turtles, coupled neurons produce a propagating wave of activity that seems to respond to the visual input to the turtle retina. Like wise, an array of coupled LASERS seems to phase-lock into a sustained level of oscillation with a certain phase relation between two adjacent LASERS. Finally, an array of MEMS devices can be used to implement electro-statically controlled micro-actuators. These can be used to control locomotion of a land crawler or a swimmer.<br/><br/>For each of the three pattern generating circuits, the relationship between the controlled input and the generated oscillatory pattern would be studied with the following two specific tasks in mind. If the input is a sensory input, viz. visual input to the retina, the generated oscillatory patterns encode the sensory signals. For example, the location and velocity of a target is encoded in the spatiotemporal response of the generated cortical waves. An important task is to localize targets and to predict its future location by measuring the oscillatory patterns in the circuit. If the input to the circuit is a control input, viz. electrostatic input to a MEMS array, each element of the array is viewed as a signal generator that provides control input to a local actuator. An important task in locomotion is gait control which involves maintaining and switching between gaits. To achieve this task one needs to switch from one oscillatory pattern to another, perhaps as quickly as possible. <br/><br/> In summary, pattern generating circuits will be used for the purpose of sensory encoding and decoding with a specific aim towards target tracking. They will also be used to provide coordinated control signals to a large number of actuators with a specific aim towards locomotion control. An important extension of the proposed problem is gait control which involves smoothly switching between patterns in minimum time.

The workshop comes at a time when governments and organizations are struggling to expand access to statistical and other databases while simultaneously protecting medical and other administrative records, and combating breaches of cyberinfrastructure security, especially those involving unauthorized record linkage and individual identification and harm. There has been a long tradition of confidentiality associated with statistical databases, but the ever-expanding cyberinfrastructure raises new and far more challenging questions about the protection of privacy associated with electronic databases involving individuals, families and other groups, and organizations. The goal of this workshop is to bring together leading privacy researchers from the statistics and computer science communities to share expertise and map out feasible research goals. It will (1) help shape an interdisciplinary methodologically-oriented intellectual agenda for the area of privacy and confidentiality by establishing commonly understood terminology, goals, and methodological description, (2) stimulate new interdisciplinary collaborations on the topic, and (3) influence the directions that confidentiality research takes in the separate disciplines. Specific areas of investigation include finding mathematically/statistically rigorous definitions of confidentiality, disclosure, and privacy that transcend specific problem and model details, finding minimal definitions of statistical utility, understanding the tension between privacy and utility, and understanding the role of auxiliary information (extra information known to the adversary) in defeating privacy objectives.
0516705	The Role of Developmental Genes in Controlling Butterfly Eyespot Patterns II	IOS	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY CLUSTER	11/01/2005	03/31/2006	Antonia Monteiro	NY	SUNY at Buffalo	Standard Grant	Judith Plesset	11/30/2006	$396,000.00		antonia.monteiro@yale.edu	520 Lee Entrance	Amherst	NY	142282567	7166452634	BIO	7471	1228, 9178, 9183, 9251, BIOT, SMET	$0.00	The emerging field of evo-devo studies, in part, how genotype connects to phenotype. This project seeks to test the function of a few candidate transcription factors in the development of butterfly eyespots. Several transcription factors and gene circuits that are known to be involved in wing and leg development in Drosophila are hypothesized to be involved in the development of eyespots in butterflies. In particular, when Distal-less (Dll) is ectopically activated in Drosophila it causes complete leg duplications, thus suggesting a master regulatory function. In Bicyclus, Dll is expressed in signaling cells in the eyespot's center at the earliest stages of eyespot development, and moreover, variation in Dll is linked with variation in eyespot size. Have butterflies co-opted the same leg developmental circuit in the formation of eyespots? An activated ligand receptor, phosphorylated Mothers Against Decapentaplegic, pMad, is expressed in the eyespot field during early pupal development. Is the morphogen Decapentaplegic (Dpp) being produced at the eyespot's center, diffusing to surrounding cells and differentiating a complete eyespot pattern? Another transcription factor, Engrailed (En), is expressed in a ring of epidermal cells that correlates with the pattern of gold colored scales on the eyespot of the adult Bicyclus wing. Does En cause the differentiation of gold colored scales in eyespots? The experiments outlined in this project test these hypotheses by ectopically expressing Dll, Dpp, and En on the developing wing and observing whether, in the first two cases, a complete eyespot pattern differentiates around the site of expression, or whether, in the second case, gold scales develop at the site of expression. Additional experiments will test whether over-expressing Dll and Dpp at the eyespot's center will lead to differences in eyespot size. To induce ectopic expression the lab has developed a laser-assisted heat-shocking technique that will allow the activation of these genes in a controlled spatial and temporal fashion on the developing wing of transgenic butterflies. The heat-shocking technique has been successfully tested with a fluorescent marker gene but now this marker will be substituted for the coding sequences of Dll, Dpp, and En. Establishing a causal relationship between these genes and differentiation of eyespots or colored scales will allow the later examination of the relationship between the evolution of these genes and the evolution of the phenotype. Intellectual merit: Much work in evo-devo has been dominated by inferring novel functions for genes based solely on their novel expression domains. This project intends to go beyond the correlational evidence and to really test whether old developmental genes belonging to known gene circuits have been functionally co-opted to specify a morphological novelty in evolution, butterfly eyespots. Once this functional co-option is established future work will attempt to track the evolution of eyespots, from their creation throughout their various levels of quantitative and qualitative modifications. This long-term study will dissect the evolution of regulatory genes with a demonstrated key role in differentiating these adaptive traits. This project aims to test whether a few candidate genes display that key role. In addition, this project will make available a series of transformation constructs of wide applicability across organisms, as well as develop important tools for functional genetics in non-model organisms. Broader Impacts: Dr. Monteiro has currently involved one postdoc and 3 graduate students in this project. One is a woman and a member of the Native American tribe Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Another is a minority graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engeneering at Buffalo. These two students are both recipients of NSF IGERT training grants in Biophotonics, and are truly working at the interface of Biology and Photonics via an established collaboration with the Department of Electrical Engineering at Buffalo. She will continue to train graduate and undergraduates students alike in Population Genetics, Phylogenetics, and Developmental Biology, irrespective of gender and ethnicity, in order to provide them with a broad multifaceted approach to Evolution and Development.

Pushing the limits of hardware and software technologies to extract the maximum performance, in turn, exacerbates other problems. Notable amongst these problems is the susceptibility to failures, which arises as a consequence of growing hardware transient errors, hardware device failures, software complexity, and the complex hardware/software inter-dependencies between the nodes of a parallel system. These failures can have substantial consequences on system performance, in addition to impacting the costs of maintenance/operation, thereby putting at risk the very motivation behind deploying these large scale systems.<br/><br/>This research is expected to make three broad contributions towards developing a runtime infrastructure, called PROGNOSIS, for failure data collection and online analysis. The first set of contributions will be on collecting and analyzing system events and failure data from an actual BlueGene/L system over an extended period of time. In addition to presenting the raw system events, the research will be developing filtering techniques to remove unimportant information and identifying stationary intervals, together with defining the attributes for logging and their frequency. The second set of contributions will be models for online analysis and prediction of evolving failure data by exploiting correlations between system events over time, across the nodes, and with respect to external factors such as imposed workload and operating temperature. The third set of contributions will be on demonstrating the uses of PROGNOSIS. Tools such as PROGNOSIS can help substantially in the development of self-healing systems, which has been noted to be an important goal in the emerging area of Autonomic Computing by several computer vendors.

The approach is the sequential: (1) synthesis of Y-junction morphologies through chemical vapor deposition processes, (2) assembly of the junctions into electrical circuits through nano-contacts fabricated by focused ion beam milling and in situ metal evaporation, (3) electrical characterization of nanoscale transport characteristics, (4) structural analysis by transmission electron microscopy, and (5) identification of desirable device characteristics for novel nanoelectronic devices. The carrier delocalization, and the catalyst particles introduced during growth, induces scattering centers at the junction region which can be exploited in Y-junction based electronic devices. In preliminary electrical measurements, both diode like and inverting/switching behavior was observed in three-terminal Y-junctions, up to 50 kHz, which will be investigated.  <br/>        The broader impact would be: (a) the fabrication of novel and economical devices with advantages of low power consumption, radiation hardness, and reduced heat dissipation over conventional silicon based technologies, relevant to both civilian and military applications, (b) to convey the excitement of nano-science and technology to the wider community through developing new courses, freshman seminars, and outreach activities. By working with Preuss High School on the UCSD campus, a student and teacher exchange program will be developed. The graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will be exposed to cutting edge nanotechnology research, preparing them for careers in academe and industry. <br/>

Lambert	12/31/2007	$11,990.00		olovejoy@aol.com	OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER	KENT	OH	442420001	3306722070	SBE	1392	9179, SMET	$0.00	Published data demonstrate that mammals from the same litter reared at different temperatures have different adult limb and body proportions in parallel with those of natural populations living at climatic extremes. Animals raised in cold conditions have stout bodies with shortened limbs and extremities, while those housed at warmer temperatures exhibit peripheral appendage elongation. These changes resemble those predicted by Allen's rule, the ecogeographical principle long recognized to be an adaptive mechanism for thermoregulation. Although typically thought to be genetic in nature, some of these phenotypic changes appear to be ontogenetic responses to temperature stress; however, only descriptive studies have been reported to date and the mechanisms underlying such changes are unknown and have not yet been investigated. Temperature may directly influence cellular kinetics such that growth rate is increased at warm temperatures but retarded in the cold. If correct, then these changes should be manifested in cartilaginous growth plates, sites of rapid longitudinal bone growth during postnatal development. Impaired vasculature could also limit growth rate by reducing the amount of essential oxygen, nutrients, and hormones available to developing bones via cold-induced vasoconstriction. There are currently no empirical data to support these ideas, and growth plate morphology in animals chronically exposed to extreme temperatures throughout ontogeny remains unexplored. <br/><br/>The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that cold temperature limits bone growth by reducing growth plate kinetics and/or vascular supply, and that warm temperature enhances these processes. A model for investigating climate-induced skeletal changes will be established by housing mice at different temperatures (7, 20, and 27 degrees C) during their active growth period as previously described in the literature. Basic growth data will be recorded throughout a nine week experimental period and an ontogenetic series will be created in order to examine the effects of temperature on bone histology and blood flow at different stages of development. Cell proliferation and apoptosis (programmed death) in long bone growth plates will be quantified using immunohistochemistry, and detailed morphology will be studied under light microscopy. Vascular supply will be analyzed using a combination of immunohistochemical methods to detect new vessel formation and fluorescent microsphere techniques to measure regional bone blood flow. <br/><br/>SCIENTIFIC MERIT: This study will provide information essential to understanding how species modify skeletal proportions in response to environmental pressures and could thereby profoundly impact the manner in which intra- and inter-specific variation in geographical clines is perceived. By discriminating the relative influence of temperature on bone growth and blood supply, this work can further elucidate the morphological variation observed in the fossil record and might also help resolve major phylogenetic controversies across disciplines.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: These results will enhance understanding of the complex factors involved in regulating normal longitudinal bone growth. The parameters to be examined here are relevant to a variety of biomedical research models of skeletal injury and disease, especially those involving impaired bone growth and vasculature. By integrating ideas from anthropology, ecology, molecular biology, and physiology, this project encourages collaboration between students and senior researchers from diverse backgrounds and specialties.

Valsaraj and Raghunathan Ravikrishna<br/>Institution: Louisiana State University<br/>Proposal Number: 0520524<br/><br/>Research<br/><br/>The overall objective of this project is the development of a monolith photocatalytic reactor using photonic band gap (PBG) titania for the treatment of dilute waste gases. The hypothesis is that, PBG titania produced in-situ and grafted on stripped fiber optic tubes using sol-gel chemistry and used in a monolithic configuration, can vastly improve UV absorption, quantum efficiency, the photocatalytic activity, and reduce the mass transfer limitations in a large scale reactor for photocatalytic degradation of organics in gaseous waste streams. The use of long range ordered porous structures of photonic band-gap exhibiting titania grown on optical fibers is expected to enhance the overall photocatalytic efficiency as compared to using powdered titania coating on stripped optical fibers due to improved light transmission properties and better mass transfer. The PBG titania will be manufactured on the optical fibers using two templates for solgel processing- a) polystyrene microspheres and b) polyaphrons (emulsions). The individual optical fiber monoliths with the PBG titania will be bundled together to form a composite monolith reactor. PBG material characteristics will be tailored at the synthesis stage in order to enhance the reactive efficiency of the composite monolith photocatalytic reactor in UV light. The composite monolith reactor will be used to degrade a test compound, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, in aqueous solutions. The specific objectives are:<br/>1. Preparation of PBG titania crystals on optical fibers using a sol/gel (solution) method<br/>2. Characterization of the PBG titania thin films and determination of their photonic properties.<br/>3. Construction of the internal configurations for the monolithic reactor.<br/>4. Testing the reactor on a candidate compound under various reaction conditions.<br/>5. Obtaining a mathematical model to extract kinetic rate constants and mass transfer characteristics useful for possible scale-up of the process.<br/><br/><br/>Broad Impact<br/><br/>The proposal is high risk since the use of PBG materials in a continuous monolith photocatalytic reactor configuration is a concept that is yet to be tested. The development of this technology could have a significant impact on the application of photocatalytic processes to the treatment waste gas streams. It is high return because if successful, the reactor design offers a potential for scale up that can alleviate the current barriers to the use of photocatalytic reactors for industrial waste gas treatment. The broad impact is thus in the area of environmental sustainability.

By truncating sharply the duration of decision periods, this near-continuous framework allows for a very considerable expansion of participant decision-profiles. Increasing decision-profiles in this way is not without some parallels to natural posted-offer markets, particularly when making comparisons across trading institutions. Many economists, for<br/>example, evaluate posted-offer market performance in light of markets organized under double auction trading rules. But high value items, such as stocks and other financial instruments typically trade in double auction markets, while relatively low value consumer goods more frequently trade in posted-offer markets. In order to match the dollar volume associated with a single representative double auction transaction, many<br/>consumer goods sellers may have multiple opportunities to revisit their pricing decisions. More importantly, the expansion of participant decision profiles allowed by this near-continuous framework addresses the common criticism of posted-offer market and oligopoly laboratory results, that insufficient experience with the market or game drives observed disequilibrium behavior. <br/><br/>The PI will conduct a series of four experiments that exploit the longer decision profiles allowed by extensive repetition. They include (a) an examination of a pair of stylized facts regarding the response of posted-offer markets to changes in underlying supply and/or demand conditions; (b) an experiment designed to examine interactions between pure numbers and market power effects in a Bertrand-Edgeworth pricing game; (c) a further examination of the drawing power of Antitrust Logit Model; and (d) an experiment designed to evaluate the long run stability of outcomes in Cournot games.<br/><br/>Vernon Smith argues that developing new tools that allow for the better empirical examination of theories represents perhaps the most important task in science. This award will fund one such tool. Results of the four investigations described in the proposal will be interesting, regardless of the outcomes. Broadly speaking, if the near-continuous framework eliminates the stylized facts that have come to characterize some frequently observed laboratory deviations from competitive and game-theoretic equilibrium predictions, then I will have developed a new platform for evaluating repeated oligopoly games. On the other hand, the persistence of these stylized facts in a near-continuous framework would suggest that at least one idiosyncrasy of standard laboratory methods does not drive these facts, and would thus provide yet further support for the argument that the pertinent theories fail to explain important aspects of behavior.<br/><br/>Experimental research is an ideal way to expose and involve interested undergraduates in the research enterprise. Undergraduate students will participate in this research project as assistants. Exposure of talented undergraduates to the research enterprise in economics is particularly scarce in universities like Virginia Commonwealth University, a racially and ethnically diverse, open access public university without a Ph.D. program in economics.

However, this activity has received scant recent attention from the volcanological community, in part because these eruptions do not fit neatly into existing classification schemes. To provide a more comprehensive physical understanding of VS eruptions, Profs. Cashman and Wallace (University of Oregon) will collaborate with Prof. Rosi (University of Pisa) and Prof. Delgado (UNAM, Mexico) to conduct a comparative and multi-disciplinary investigation of deposits produced by well-described violent strombolian eruptions of Paricutin (1943, Mexico) and Vesuvius (1906, Italy). Important issues to be addressed include the role of magmatic volatiles in generating violent strombolian eruptions, mechanisms of ash generation, rapid transitions in eruption styles, and the characteristic relationship between explosive and effusive (lava flow) activity. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this study relate to hazard assessment, as the high ash content and large dispersal range generated by violent strombolian explosions may cause severe economic disruption through problems of ash disposal and extensive disruption of air traffic, as illustrated by recent violent strombolian activity at Mt. Etna, Italy. Because of the potential for this type of activity in many parts of the world, the PIs have designed the educational component of the proposed work to include American, Mexican and Italian students, who will be involved with hazard assessment in addition to basic research.

The methodology used to characterize stress-induced permeability anisotropy is to conduct both conventional extension and hybrid compression tests at the same pressure and temperature conditions. Since their loading paths coincide, the comparison of permeability values from the two types of tests provides quantitative estimates of the development of permeability anisotropy as function of effective mean and differential stresses. Specific tasks include: 1) to conduct conventional triaxial extension tests on both Indiana and Solnhofen limestones; 2) to conduct hybrid triaxial compression tests on both Indiana and Solnhofen limestones; 3) to conduct microstructural observation on the deformed samples. The focus of this study is to investigate the inelastic behavior and the evolution of permeability anisotropy upon failure in porous limestones at elevated temperature. The goal is to establish dynamic links between the evolution of permeability and the micromechanisms of failure, which is essential in understanding many seismogenic, sedimentary and metamorphic processes. <br/>Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity<br/>The proposed study will generate experimental data on how stress affects transport properties (porosity and permeability) in crustal rocks. The data will be of interest to scientists in many disciplines. Among other things, the proposed study will provide data that are useful for understanding fault mechanics, improving resource recovery, and predicting reservoir stability. Through websites, presentations, discussions and hands-on experiments, the PI will involve graduate students, undergraduate students (through WHOI summer student fellowship program), minority students and local high school students in the proposed study. Through these education and outreach activities, the proposed research will serve as a platform for cultivating and training researchers of the future.

Loiselle. Her collaborator in Ecuador will be Dr. Kelly Swing at Universidad San Francisco de Quito. The project will address the question of what makes certain males so attractive to females and productively successful. The model system to be used will be the white-crowned manakin (Pipra pipra), of the lekking species. Reproductive success will be measured indirectly using behavioral observations at leks as well as directly using microsatellite paternity analysis. The influence of ecological, behavioral and genetic factors on the outcome of male reproductive success will be analyzed in light of possible tradeoffs or interaction among variables.<br/><br/>Understanding what determines female mate choice and male reproductive success is central to sexual selection theory. Mate choice is a complex issue as it is often the result of interplay of direct (e.g. paternal care, territory quality) and indirect benefits (e.g. good genes) to females. Lek-mating systems provide a unique opportunity to study these processes. In addition, this project will strengthen the collaborative relationship between the U.S. institution and the host institution.

The transbilayer movement of lipid, also known as lipid flip-flop or translocation, is a fundamentally important issue in molecular biology and has attracted interest among biologists and chemists for decades. Typically, lipid flip-flop has been investigated by nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (NMR), electron spin resonance spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques with model membrane systems such as vesicles and planar-supported lipid bilayers. To perform NMR or fluorescence measurements, lipids must be either spin-labeled or fluorescence-labeled. The labeling process will modify lipid physical properties and therefore has been considered as the drawback of these techniques. In this work, the PI is using a novel methodology to investigate lipid transbilayer movement that does not require the labeling. In addition, real-time monitoring of transbilayer movement can be attained. The PI is studying various properties of the flip-flop of perdeuterated lipids in planar membranes such as its activation energy, its dependence on lateral pressure, the effect of lipid structure and of membrane composition. In particular, the influence of cholesterol and selected membrane-active peptides on phospholipid flip-flop is being addressed. <br/><br/>New findings drawn from the research could have a significant impact in molecular and cellular biology. Further, taking into account the increasing relevance of supported bilayers in nanotechnology and other fields, the proposal provides a very powerful and original approach to study and to optimize those films for various applications.
0526462	Collaborative Research: Ecotypic Diversity and Adaptation of Prochlorococcus in the Stratified, High Temperature Waters of the Western Pacific Warm Pool	OCE	BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY, EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES	01/01/2006	07/27/2005	Zackary Johnson	HI	University of Hawaii	Standard Grant	David L.

Although the worldwide distributions of Prochlorococcus are generally understood, the precise reasons for its overwhelming ecological success have remained elusive. This picture has recently become complicated by the discovery that Prochlorococcus is not monophyletic and that different genetic clades of Prochlorococcus have remarkably different distributions with depth and over oceanic basins. Thus, our understanding of factors that structure Prochlorococcus populations in the natural environment, and our ability to predict how this structure might respond to environmental changes, are limited. The PIs will address this by focusing on naturally occurring populations in the Western Pacific Warm Pool, an area where Prochlorococcus is known to dominate, but where there are no data on clade abundances. In addition to being a large region of the Pacific Ocean with significance to the global carbon cycle, the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) is of particular interest because it is typically highly stratified, with surface waters having extreme temperatures and light levels compared to those at depth. Populations of Prochlorococcus at the surface and at depth experience different environmental pressures, and may belong to different clades and have different adaptive physiologies. The PIs will test this hypothesis on a cruise from Christchurch, New Zealand to Hawaii through the stratified WPWP. Samples from this transect will be used to quantify (using quantitative PCR) the six known clades of Prochlorococcus and to search for new clades (using clone libraries and isolates) and their abundances. The ultimate goal is to relate clade abundances to temperature, light, nutrient concentrations and other measured biological, chemical and physical variables. <br/><br/>This project will encompass multiple layers of outreach to scientists and the scientific community at large. Data and strains will be deposited at national repositories and results will be disseminated through publications, professional meeting presentations, and a project web site. Undergraduates and graduate students will be trained, and students will be an integral part of the data collection, analysis, and dissemination phases and will be encouraged to present at national meetings. Cross-institutional training will enhance graduate student education. The PIs will integrate results from this project into undergraduate and graduate curricula at their home institutions and will be attending the NSF sponsored 'Scientific Inquiry in the K-16 Classroom' seminar to develop methods to link results to primary education. The PIs will use presentations and activities with local outreach groups, such as the Hawaii Academy of Sciences, to encourage scientific understanding through mentoring, science symposia and science competitions for primary and secondary school students.
0510131	Numerical Linear Algebra and Approximation Theory Methods for Efficient Data Exploration	DMS	COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS	07/01/2005	07/13/2005	Yousef Saad	MN	University of Minnesota-Twin Cities	Standard Grant	Junping Wang	06/30/2009	$271,647.00		saad@umn.edu	200 OAK ST SE	Minneapolis	MN	554552070	6126245599	MPS	1271	0000, 9263, OTHR	$0.00	This proposal aims at developing new and effective algorithms for<br/>performing dimensionality reduction tasks by methods which blend<br/>techniques from numerical linear algebra and approximation theory.<br/>Current implementations of LSI, and other dimensionality reduction<br/>methods, rely on matrix decompositions such as the Singular Value<br/>Decomposition (SVD). SVD-based methods compute explicitly the basis<br/>of the dominant singular vectors and proceed with a projection of the<br/>data on this basis. This has the desirable effect of filtering out<br/>noise and redundancy inherent to the data, while retaining its main<br/>structural features (e.g., `semantic contents' in LSI). However,<br/>SVD-based methods tend to be expensive, both in terms of computational<br/>cost and storage, and become impractical for very large data sets.<br/>The premise of this proposal is that there is no need to compute the<br/>(partial) SVD in order to perform dimensionality reduction. The<br/>projection of a given vector onto the space associated with the<br/>largest singular values can be accurately reproduced by a polynomial<br/>filtering technique. This technique, which entails repeated<br/>multiplication of a vector by the original data matrix and its<br/>transpose, offers several advantages including low computational and<br/>storage requirements. In addition, ``relevance feedback'', which<br/>enhances significantly the quality of the results of LSI, can be<br/>easily adapted for polynomial filtering. Perhaps more important is<br/>the excellent flexibility of polynomial filtering in enabling various<br/>desired reduction features. For example, an appropriate choice of the<br/>filter will yield an arbitrarily smooth transition from the unwanted<br/>components (small singular values) to the wanted ones (large singular<br/>values) in contrast with the discontinuous cut-off which characterizes<br/>Truncated SVD (TSVD). Also, some applications may require an accurate<br/>projection (high degree polynomial) while for others this would be<br/>wasteful or even counter-productive.<br/><br/>Society is currently facing an explosive surge of exploitable<br/>information in scientific, engineering, and economical applications.<br/>The rapidly increasing sizes of the data sets becoming available is<br/>starting to render inadequate many of the algorithms used in `data<br/>exploration' in spite of their merits when computational costs are set<br/>aside. The methods investigated in this research will address the<br/>issue of cost by taking a new approach which completely avoids the<br/>bottleneck of the classical algorithms. If fully successful the<br/>methods to be developed may significantly enhance the capabilities of<br/>current state-of-the-art methods used in key areas of information<br/>technology. For example, preliminary studies have shown that when<br/>processing a query in a database, the proposed methods can sometimes<br/>offer a tenfold gain in speed relative to standard methods, without<br/>any loss of accuracy. The investigating team will also extend this<br/>approach to the problem of face recognition. The method also has<br/>excellent prospects in other potential applications including image<br/>processing, and medical tomography.

Ross <br/><br/>New technologies, interdisciplinary studies, and the urgency of global change make Earth system science (ESS) one of the fastest evolving areas of science. Unfortunately, the general public has little understanding of the breadth and significance of ESS research. Museums and science centers, which nationally receive over 100 million visits per year, are ideal venues for educating the public. Yet many museums present out-of-date Earth science information using antiquated approaches, and many museum professionals are not satisfied with the coverage of ESS in their current exhibits. The absence of readily available models of best practices, and of networks for communication among providers of informal geoscience education, has contributed to these problems. <br/><br/>This planning project is developing a detailed plan for producing the resources necessary to inform the general public about current ESS research using informal education venues. The project involves a multiyear collaboration among six major providers of informal geoscience education. The current status of informal geoscience education is being evaluated, and a white paper summary of recommendations is being prepared. A DLESE collection for informal geoscience education is being developed to disseminate the results of the project to the geoscience community at large. <br/><br/>The project is being evaluated to determine the effectiveness of traveling exhibits and plans for exhibits and programming, all of which are being designed for broad utility. The project, both through communication among the six core collaborators and networking among many dozens of other entities, is expected to improve the quality of geoscience exhibits and programming nationwide.

Two specific research projects, which will benefit significantly from the capabilities of the DP-NSOM, are presented. Acquisition of the DP-NSOM will directly enable substantive collaborations among three academic departments at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Whitehead Institute. This acquisition will also provide significantly enhanced experimental capabilities to two junior faculty whose research groups each apply engineering principles to the study of cellular and molecular mechanics. Further, this DP-NSOM will be a vital experimental component of proposed cross-departmental collaborations among these and additional investigators, focusing on analytical and computational modeling of cytoskeletal mechanics. This acquisition will also significantly contribute to MIT's initiatives in cross-disciplinary education. In addition to research training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, educational efforts within MIT will include new graduate- and undergraduate-level laboratory modules.

Al have build models of brain development and learning which account for axonal growth and genetic regulation to some degree. This PI will attempt to build a more integrated model, by combining insights from that class of model with insights from the area of quantitative systems biotechnology, in order to model the entire process of development from an initial stem cell to an intelligent brain.<br/><br/>Broader benefits: From the viewpoint of basic science, the ultimate goals of this project will require many years to fully attain. However, some of the key initial steps in modeling may lead to insights of nearer-term practical value. For example, the initial work includes an integrated modeling of the phenomenon, effects and natural mechanisms involved in the death of cells - an issue of some importance to efforts to understand and deal with conditions like, cancer, HIV and aging.

The method is of considerable significance, both scientifically and technologically, because it possesses a number of desirable attributes in terms of the low synthesis temperature, chemical flexibility and the ability to design materials with specific properties and morphology. These and other priority areas will be discussed at this conference. The International Workshop on Sol-Gel Science and Technology is widely recognized as the most prominent conference in this field as it brings together a multidisciplinary group of scientists and engineers to disseminate the most important research and technological developments. This workshop has been held biennually for over 20 years, but has never been held in the United States.<br/><br/>The broader impacts include opportunities for the participants to foster collaborative relationships with other scientists where there are mutual interests in biomaterials areas. It will give early career faculty, post doctoral scholars, and graduate students an opportunity to engage in cross-disciplinary discussions with colleagues from other universities, government laboratories and industry.

The results will be applied to three outstanding problems in planetary<br/>astronomy:<br/><br/>1) Does Jupiter have a core and did it emerge from core accretion?<br/><br/>2) What are the properties of the metallic to molecular transition in hydrogen inside giant planets and how does it affect the distribution of helium?<br/><br/>3) What mechanism prolonged Saturn's cooling (observed to be twice as long as<br/>predicted)?<br/><br/>Moreover, equations of state for degenerate hydrogen-helium mixtures developed here will be critical components in models of extrasolar giant planets. These results are expected to significantly improve our ability to constrain the physical properties of these planets from transit and radial velocity data.<br/><br/>The final equations of state and the software to interpolate among them will be placed on the web for public use.<br/><br/>One post-doctoral fellow will be supported and undergraduates will be included in the research as part of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site program.

When observational resources are scarce and expensive, an adaptive approach to selecting which observations to make, based on the data assembled thus far, should be able to improve the accuracy, precision and efficiency of the work. This research will develop a general framework for flexible, adaptive scientific exploration based on iterating an Observation-Inference-Design cycle, relying on Bayesian methods and called Bayesian Adaptive Exploration (BAE). Developing BAE through a broad range of methodological research, and then applying BAE to several time-variable phenomena, will lead to numerous theoretical and algorithmic innovations in statistics, and to significantly improved answers in the study of extra-solar planets, binary star systems, minor planets in our solar system, and variable stars in nearby galaxies. Since the required calculations are extremely demanding, several approaches will be explored, including extending existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo inference algorithms, developing bridge/path importance sampling algorithms and Gaussian process meta-models, and the use of sub-region-adaptive quadrature.<br/><br/>BAE is an adaptive generalization of the scientific method and will therefore be broadly applicable in many disciplines. This project will create and widely disseminate public-domain software implementing the methods, with tutorial and instructional material. At least one graduate student will receive extensive interdisciplinary training.

Traditionally, scientists thought that associations between plants and AMF were non-species specific, but recent work shows that both plants and AMF species have preferences for particular partners. How these preferences affect AMF community composition in mixed plant communities remains unclear. For my dissertation, I am working in the California coastal prairies of Marin County to compare the effects of plant hosts on the composition of the AMF community. I will examine how invasive plant monocultures can alter AMF assemblages, and I will test whether certain plants in the local neighborhood can exert disproportionately large influence on the AMF community of another plant host. Additionally, my research will describe how AMF assemblages can shift as new plant species and new species combinations are added to the system. Results from this research will illustrate how invasion-mediated shifts in the plant community can alter belowground communities, since a loss of diversity aboveground may be mirrored by a loss of diversity belowground. Investigations such as the one proposed here will help us understand the broad, ecosystem-level implications of these widespread plant invasions.

It is the purpose of the research described in this proposal to design and implement accurate, efficient, reliable, and robust methods for the numerical simulations of such systems. These methods should be capable of exploiting special structure often present in such systems to increase the computational efficiency. Examples of such systems with special structure include many problems in computational fluid dynamics, molecular biology, quantum mechanics, and heat transfer, and their numerical solution requires new more powerful numerical techniques than the classical methods. The novel techniques which will be investigated in this proposal are based on the recent theory of general linear methods and on exponential integrators which treat differently specific parts of the differential systems. Some of the proposed schemes are appropriate for implementation in a parallel computing environment.

The problems to be addressed by the<br/>investigator and his colleagues include the development of an<br/>appropriate mathematical model for nonlinear motion blurs, analysis of<br/>the ill-conditioning of the blurring process, development of efficient<br/>algorithms for removing motion blur, and development of software for<br/>specific applications.  Algorithm and software development is needed<br/>for the solution of large scale, severely ill-conditioned linear<br/>systems that arise in the discrete formulation of these problems. For<br/>nonlinear and nonuniform motion, these systems generally have no<br/>exploitable structure; that is, standard deconvolution techniques that<br/>use fast Fourier transforms are not applicable. <br/><br/>Images used for surveillance, medical diagnostic, and other scientific<br/>purposes are rarely perfect.  Imperfections in the imaging system and<br/>environmental effects may result in serious degradations, such as<br/>blurring, in the recorded image.  Postprocessing techniques (i.e.,<br/>computational methods) are often necessary to obtain better quality<br/>pictures.  Designing appropriate algorithms requires accurate<br/>mathematical modeling of the image formation process, and development<br/>of robust, efficient computational tools.  One of the most common<br/>causes of blurring in images is motion of either the recording device<br/>or the objects being imaged.  Although linear motion, with constant<br/>speed and direction, is well understood, very little work has been<br/>done to develop mathematical models and efficient algorithms for the<br/>restoration of images degraded by nonlinear and nonuniform motion<br/>blurs.  The investigator and his colleagues consider this difficult,<br/>important problem.  The software developed through this project can be<br/>applied to many important applications, including medical imaging<br/>(e.g., movement of the heart during cardiac imaging processes), aerial<br/>and video surveillance, forensic investigations, and astronomical<br/>imaging.<br/>

It also includes the development of the theory of<br/>multiplier ideals in the singular setting, and a study of the commutative<br/>algebraic properties of jet schemes, especially for combinatorially rich<br/>cases such as monomial schemes.<br/><br/>The work proposed here is part of the broader landscape of research in<br/>pure algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, the fields that study<br/>the geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) that can be described<br/>by polynomial equations.

With a long term goal for capturing into a computational model the knowledge related to the acoustic processing streams acquired by a speech and hearing scientist through experiments with the human auditory system, the short-term goals include:<br/>Understanding what portions of the auditory processing system ought to be included in the model, building a neural network model in consultation with researchers in speech and hearing sciences, and Validating the model by running computer simulations against experimentally observed data. Such a model is expected to predict brainstem responses to audio signals that come in via the human ear and partition into its finer spectral components in the cochlea from where the impulses travel via the auditory nerve and several specialized nuclei in the brainstem to the auditory cortex. The fact that the audio signals split into two distinct what and where streams in the auditory cortex or en-route to it motivates the research. Although many computational models of the auditory system exists, the novelty of the proposed research lies in<br/>Including the ventral and dorsal streams in the computational model and Validating the model against auditory brainstem responses observed in children with learning disorders.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: A validated model opens the door to study the impact of proposed treatments for children with learning disabilities based on auditory deficiencies. Using this approach, computer approximations could serve as a fast and relative inexpensive precursor to possible treatments. Students will also gain expertise in the area.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This research will expand the discipline of neuro-computational modeling and should contribute in understanding the causes of learning disabilities in children, thus enabling development of the corresponding treatments.

Patrick of Western Washington University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the use of thermotropic liquid crystal solvents for preparing organic thin films with controlled molecular- and macroscopic-scale order. Liquid crystal solvents will be combined with single crystal graphite substrates to systematically and rationally break configurational symmetry in molecular monolayers. The technique affords control over molecular orientation, chirality, polymorphism, and conformation. Together the family of methods that will be developed will extend the modern toolkit of techniques for organic thin film growth, allowing the preparation of films engineered to possess new dimensions of organization. <br/>The ability to exert structural control over the arrangement of molecules in organic thin films impacts a wide range of research areas in different disciplines where there is a need for ordered films on technologically relevant substrates. Research areas that are directly impacted include chiral chromatography, nonlinear optical materials, enantioselective sensors, polarizing films for liquid crystal devices, and catalysts. Undergraduate students will receive training and experience in all aspects of the research.
0519013	Collaborative Research: Inflation and Redistribution	SES	ECONOMICS	08/01/2005	08/11/2008	Klaus Martin Schneider	NY	New York University	Continuing grant	Daniel H. Newlon	12/31/2008	$135,246.00		martin.schneider@nyu.edu	70 WASHINGTON SQUARE S	NEW YORK	NY	100121019	2129982121	SBE	1320	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This proposal outlines research on the redistribution effects of inflation. Redistribution of real wealth is an immediate consequence of any unanticipated change in the price level. Inflation lowers the real value of nominal assets and liabilities, and thereby shifts wealth from lenders to borrowers. Existing studies have focused on the revaluation of government debt. The research described in this proposal considers the revaluation of all nominal assets and liabilities in the economy. The goal is to provide a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the redistribution effects of inflation, as well as their implications for macroeconomic aggregates and welfare.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is that it enhances our understanding of the real effects of inflation. The proposal achieves this objective by employing two analytical tools. The first is an empirical framework used to document exposure to inflation risk in the United States, for different sectors as well as age and wealth groups of households. The framework combines sectoral data from the Flow of Funds Accounts, household-level data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, as well as data on the payoff structure and market prices of nominal assets to construct a consistent array of nominal positions. To gauge the duration of these positions, future payment streams are estimated by date, agent, and type of nominal instrument. The second tool is a dynamic general equilibrium model that can be used to assess the economic effects of redistribution shocks. The model allows for heterogeneity along the same dimensions as the data; it is calibrated to match key macroeconomic aggregates as well as properties of the wealth and income distribution. It can also accommodate various fiscal policy scenarios that may arise in response to an inflation episode. The proposal describes an application that uses the tools to quantify the wealth redistribution that would occur if the United States were to enter another moderate inflation episode similar to that of the 1970s. This application leads to three main results. First, even moderate inflation can cause a sizable redistribution of wealth. The main winners from inflation would be the government and young households with mortgage debt, while the main losers would be old households and, in light of the recent surge in foreign debt, foreigners. Second, the model shows that the responses of losers (old lenders) and winners (young borrowers) do not cancel out, so that redistribution due to inflation has aggregate effects. The magnitude of these effects is comparable to those in representative-agent models with monetary frictions, but the effects arising from redistribution persist long after the end of the inflation episode. Third, the welfare effect on domestic households is the opposite of what standard monetary models generate: inflation-induced redistribution has a positive effect on the weighted aggregate welfare. Overall, the application demonstrates that redistribution is an important channel for the impact of inflation on household behavior, economic aggregates, and welfare. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed research derives from its implications for monetary policy, as well as the design of institutions that help control inflation. The existing application shows that households have important reasons to disagree about monetary policy. The proposal describes a number of additional policy applications. First, the setup will be used to assess the redistribution effects of stabilization policy. Here the objective is to quantify the wealth effects of U.S. monetary policy in the 1980s. A second extension will explore the political economy implications of the findings. The existing results show that there are circumstances such that a majority of households stands to gain from inflation-induced redistribution. Moreover, the fiscal policy package that accompanies an inflationary episode is a key factor in shaping public support for inflation policies. The proposal outlines an empirical investigation of the degree to which redistribution concerns can explain the emergence of historical episodes of high inflation, as well as an extended theoretical analysis of the political economy of inflation.
0516836	Doctoral Dissertation Research in Political Science: Religion and Democratization in Christian and Islamic Societies	SES	POLITICAL SCIENCE	09/01/2005	07/28/2005	Daniel Treisman	CA	University of California-Los Angeles	Standard Grant	Brian D. Humes	08/31/2006	$3,460.00		treisman@polisci.ucla.edu	10889 Wilshire Boulevard	LOS ANGELES	CA	900951406	3107940102	SBE	1371	9179, SMET	$0.00	This Doctoral Dissertation Research project studies the role of religion in the development of democracy. While scholars, policymakers and journalists assert a strong relationship between religion and democracy, most focus on the type of religion prevalent in a country rather than on the processes through which religion affects political outcomes. This project outlines and tests a theory that identifies organizational and societal factors; rather than religious doctrine and ideology; as the main mechanisms that connect religion to political<br/>action in support of democratic transition. It uses a mixed methodological approach,<br/>including quantitative analysis of national-level empirical data and qualitative analysis<br/>of interviews and observations obtained in the course of field work in the Eurasian<br/>Republics of Armenia and Georgia.<br/>Quantitative analysis of data on the structure of religious organizations and the<br/>religious composition of societies will be used to uncover trends regarding the impact of<br/>religion on democratic transition and consolidation. An original data set is constructed<br/>that contains variables from over 120 countries across Europe, Asia, Latin America, and<br/>Africa. To supplement the data analysis, interviews of religious leaders, government<br/>officials and lay observers from the field will attempt to uncover the motivations behind<br/>political action by religious groups and the aspects of religious beliefs, practices, and<br/>organization that are most relevant to politics.<br/>This study will contribute to scholarship on democratization by focusing on components of<br/>religion and the paths through which they influence the processes of democratic transition<br/>and consolidation. It will focus on theory-building in an area of scholarship that lacks<br/>established and tested theories. It will serve to unite fields of inquiry based on the<br/>examination of ideology, mass political behavior, political values, group organization and<br/>group competition as they relate to regime change and stability. The study will also<br/>contribute qualitatively to the field of religion and politics by compiling data on<br/>Eastern Christianity and Islam that other scholars can use to perform comparative studies<br/>with other religious traditions. Examination of restrictions on religious practice and<br/>competition among religious groups will aid in understanding the role of foreign-based<br/>religious groups and the rise of religious extremism in developing democracies. Finally,<br/>focusing on former communist societies will allow for study of the effect of the easing of<br/>restrictions on religious practice and other forms of expression on the political<br/>activities of religious groups.<br/>Broader Impact: This project will have a broader impact outside of the field of political science, as democratization and the rise of religious movements are currently relevant issues in politics and important to the international community. The data that this study will<br/>compile will have particular significance for policymakers, consultants and NGOs involved<br/>in promoting democratic development, human rights, and civil society in both the Eurasian<br/>region and other areas of the world. The actions of religious groups affect the peace and<br/>stability of regimes in the region specifically, and transnational religious movements<br/>gaining popularity in these areas impact Eurasia; neighbors and the international community.
0514311	A Signal Processing Approach to Modeling Visual Masking	CCF	SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM	08/01/2005	07/27/2005	Sheila Hemami	NY	Cornell University	Standard Grant	John Cozzens	07/31/2008	$255,873.00		hemami@ece.neu.edu	373 Pine Tree Road	Ithaca	NY	148502820	6072555014	CSE	4720	9218, HPCC	$0.00	Current state-of-the-art algorithms that process images for human use<br/>treat images as signals; these techniques are successful because of both advanced signal processing techniques and signal-processing based human visual system (HVS) models.  Many applications, however are better approached with a higher-level view of images, considering color, structure, or even object content.  No unified model of either images or the HVS processing exists at this higher-level view; such a model can substantially advance the current state-of-the-art in image processing.  This research involves developing such a model and incorporating it into practical algorithms such as low-rate compression, low-rate facial compression allowing recognition, and medical imaging.<br/><br/>The human visual system initially performs low-level signal analysis and ultimately ends in cognition.  Many models of the signal analysis stage which predict responses to simple stimuli, but these models fail for natural images because humans' higher-order processing of structure produces cognitive effects which cannot be modeled using only responses to simple stimuli.  Cognition is thought to gradually occur during input processing; no single portion of the HVS is singularly responsible for recognition or transformation of the internal representation to an abstract concept. The continuum of visual processing from signal analysis to cognition suggests that signal-processing-based modeling of the HVS can be extended to include some structural processing.  This research develops such models through three psychophysical experiments.  The first is a controlled masking study allowing development of a visual masking model incorporating structure.  The second rates observers' willingness to accept distortions, relating acceptance with detection results from the first study.  The third compares recognition times for images represented using structural and signal-based representations, quantifying the use of structure in cognitive tasks.<br/><br/>

Research on MIMO wireless communication has been going on for about a decade. Various MIMO signal processing methods and information theoretical results have been developed using simplified or idealized fading channel models. Relatively less work has been done for the transceiver design of MIMO communications over realistic fading channels, which usually undergo space-selective, time-selective, and frequency-selective fading. This realistic fading is referred to as triply selective fading. The triply selective fading contains doubly selective as a special case but it is not a trivial extension, especially in terms of capacity-based transceiver design. <br/><br/>The project investigates several key problems in multiuser MIMO communications over triply selective fading channels. First, it analyzes the effects of triply selective fading and its correlation matrices on the ergodic capacity, outage capacity, network throughput, and error performance of multiuser MIMO multiple access channels (MAC) to assist in the design of capacity-based transmission policies. Secondly, it designs a cooperative multiuser MIMO MAC transceiver that requires only the correlation matrices be provided to optimize transmission policies, and investigate the design methodology for aximizing capacity gains and system performances with low system complexity. Thirdly, it develops signal processing algorithms for the information capacity-based transceivers including single carrier and multi-carrier modulations, multiuser MIMO channel estimation, and multiuser MIMO channel equalization and detection. The research in these topics will provide viable solutions for the ergodic capacity and outage capacity of multiuser MIMO triply selective fading channels that have, to date, not been successfully addressed.<br/>

Although each of these factors affects biological systems, it is not known how these factors will interact to affect ecosystems in the future. Furthermore, although arid and semi-arid lands cover approximately one third of the earth's surface, few experimental warming studies have been conducted in these systems. This research involves a multiple-factor global change experiment in an arid area at the boundary between shortgrass prairie and desert grassland, which is undergoing shrub encroachment. Specifically, the investigators will experimentally simulate predicted future environmental conditions of increased nighttime temperatures, nitrogen deposition, and El Nino frequency (which increases winter precipitation by 50% at our field site). This study focuses on species that are near the edge of their ranges, and thus may be particularly responsive to the effects of climate change. In addition, this study will measure how these global changes interact; this interaction is the largest source of uncertainty in global change research.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This study addresses several issues with important policy and economic consequences. Specifically, this research will investigate the effect of climate change on two dominant and economically important forage grasses and their susceptibility to competition from shrubs. The invasion of creosote into grasslands is associated with a decrease in forage value, and increases in carbon sequestration and nitrogen leaching, with implications for ranching, climate change feedbacks, and water quality. The investigators conduct research at a minority-serving institution and the research will include members of underrepresented groups via an ongoing undergraduate mentoring program associated with the Sevilleta LTER. Resulting data will be made available via the web and will be used in K-12 curriculum activities. The field site will include an interactive demonstration of the experimental warming protocols and signage to inform school groups and other visitors of the goals of the research.

Limited studies have been conducted up to <br/>date to investigate the deformation and fluid pressure of bone under well <br/>controlled conditions. A series of experimental studies is proposed to <br/>investigate the response of bone specimens under monotonic followed by <br/>cyclic loadings. In the experiment, the bone specimen is confined in a <br/>rubber membrane using an all-around pressure enclosed in a newly developed <br/>device. The induced deformation and fluid pressure are measured under <br/>drained and undrained conditions, respectively. The development of plastic <br/>strains and accumulated fluid pressure under cyclic loading will be <br/>revealed for different stress amplitudes and frequencies. The study is <br/>undertaken as a cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional research <br/>between applied mechanics (geomechanics) and medical science. The <br/>understanding of mechanisms of load-induced fluid flow would lead to a <br/>better interpretation of mechanosensory function in bones that has <br/>significant clinical implications.

The proposed work has the potential to increase understanding of the results of research on sex similarities and differences and on how to use these results in STEM educational policy and program design and decision-making. The project team long time gender and STEM researchers, with backgrounds in research synthesis. The project will produce and disseminate a series of research based materials to increase STEM advocate and researcher knowledge and their ability to communicate that knowledge to non-research populations. Materials will draw on theory, research and practice from the sciences, social sciences, and education.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: There is currently great media interest in this topic, but inaccuracies and stereotypes abound. By providing researchers, advocates, the media and the general internet public with usable, accessible, accurate information and tools to get this information out, this project has the potential to help policymakers, educators and even parents and students make more research based decisions. The project compliments a number of other parallel efforts to synthesize information and will likely boost attention to research.

While the fungi gain transport to a new and otherwise inaccessible host tree, the benefit of the interaction to the beetle has been debated. One paradigm holds that the fungi help the beetle kill the tree; however, many of the fungi are nonpathogenic and many species of bark beetles are nonaggressive and attack only dead trees, yet may still be associated with fungi. The goal of this project is to determine if bark beetles benefit nutritionally from their fungal associates. Using laboratory and field studies, the effects of the two main filamentous fungal associates of mountain pine beetle on beetle fitness will be determined. Differences between the two fungal associates that may explain variation in benefits conferred to the beetle will also be investigated. Periodic outbreaks of mountain pine beetle cause significant economic losses in western North American forests. If fungal associates affect beetle fitness, this could affect the population dynamics of the insect. Thus, this research will not only contribute to the understanding of factors driving multispecies interactions and shaping ecological communities, but will also lead to a greater understanding of factors that may influence the population dynamics of a major forest pest. Results will be disseminated to middle and high school students as part of field trips and to the public during bark beetle workshops. This project will support the dissertation research of a doctoral student.

International participants for the workshop are being contacted and asked to share their experience with various methodologies for the development and use of pulping technologies for the use of various non-woody plants in the manufacture of paper. There will be a particular focus on agricultural waste products in Eastern Europe, Asia Minor and the Middle East. Researchers the United States, Great Britain and Egypt are also expected to participate in the workshop. The workshop to be planned is likely to be very beneficial for identifying alternative sources of pulp from agrowaste for many wood-poor countries, as well as being beneficial for a large range of countries such as the U.S., where agricultural waste can provide environmental challenges.

The specific equipment and accompanying instruments have been selected to provide the maximum benefit to research users in the areas of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer and Information Systems, and Textile Sciences. The research applications will focus on next generation materials and recycled materials in structural/mechanical and environmental applications. Typical materials in order of expected use will include: composite materials, recycled materials, concrete, steel, titanium, aluminum, and soils. A specific example is to use the instruments for a current NSF project conducted by one of the Principal Investigators in testing hybrid titanium/high modulus carbon fiber composite laminates. <br/><br/>The specific equipment consists of a Material Testing Workstation (MTW) for characterizing mechanical properties, a Surface Area Analyzer (SAA), and an Energy Dispersive X-ray Microanalysis System (EDXMS) for determining the elemental composition of a material. The Materials Characterization facility will support the scholarly activities of the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering and the new Master of Science degree in Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. The concept of a Materials Characterization facility has provided an opportunity for faculty in the structures and environmental disciplines to collaborate on the common theme of materials even though these two disciplines seldom have common research interests. The realization of the facility will generate new thrusts in research in these two and many other disciplines by enabling an exchange of different perspectives and expertise.<br/><br/>The Civil & Environmental Department in College of Engineering of University of Massachusetts Dartmouth began a Master of Science program in the Fall of 2004. The instrumentation acquired through this award will be key components to bring the current strengths of the faculty to the next level in the common theme area of Materials Characterization. Graduate and undergraduate research assistants will directly benefit from their exposure to the cutting edge equipment. Furthermore, the multiple use of this equipment by different departments in the College will enhance the multidisciplinary research projects. The impact from current/targeted projects includes the greater recycling of waste materials, the development of new advanced materials and the improvement of safety (fire resistance and railroad protection).

The International Symposium for NanoManufacturing (ISNM) serves as the world's leading forum in which scholars, engineers and members of the business community gather to discuss the future of Nanomanufacturing. Maintaining US leadership in Nanomanufacturing is important to the national interest and therefore US scholars should be intimately involved in the activities and discussions that take place at ISNM. Specifically, US scholars need to be able to share their work, learn from other experts in the field, and be present to lead in the discussions that will shape the perspective of the Nanomanufacturing community. Toward this end, the funding from this grant will be primarily used to defray the cost of travel for US participants that will attend ISNM 2005 (to be held in Cyprus). Specifically the funds will provide support for: - US scholars to participate in poster sessions, plenary talks and tutorials<br/>-US young scholars (e.g. students) to participate in a design project competition - The recruitment of US scholars from under represented groups for ISNM 2005 & 2006 - Travel support for under represented scholars to attend ISNM 2005.<br/><br/>The expected benefits of this grant include (1) the rapid sharing and dissemination of world-wide Nanomanufacturing science into the US academic/engineering community, (2) the continued recognition of US leadership in the field, and (3) the improvement of US human resources in the following ways: (1) The training of young researchers in nano-scale engineering via a design competition (2) The dissemination of knowledge via plenary speakers (3) The creation of tutorials for education of the Nanomanufacturing community (4) The recruitment of scholars from underrepresented groups.

Defects in gluzincin function are thought to contribute to type II diabetes and altered uptake of dietary cholesterol. A plant gluzincin, APM1 appears to regulate cellular mechanisms that control the movement of the phytohormone auxin, which is required for the establishment and maintenance of plant polarity. Like IRAP and APN, APM1 is a bifunctional protein with both enzymatic and trafficking functions. APM1 functions in the cellular trafficking of Multiple Drug Resistance/ P-glycoproteins and appears to modulate other important developmental mechanisms as well. Arabidopsis apm1 mutants exhibit severe developmental defects that that can be only partially ameliorated by auxin treatment. A mechanistic function for APM1 is suggested by the regulation of sterol-dependent endocytotic cycling by mammalian IRAP and APN. The goal of the proposed research is to identify the mechanisms of APM1 action and determine their impact on auxin transport. <br/>The proposed project will<br/>1. Determine where and when APM1 functions in growth and development. APM1 regulation of auxin dependent and independent developmental processes will be examined.<br/>2. Map the membrane topology of APM1 and elucidate the mechanisms underlying APM1 function. APM1 regulation of sterol-dependent cycling of membrane transport proteins including those that transport auxin will be studied. <br/>3. Assign APM1 functions to enzymatic and trafficking domains and identify the membrane domains responsible for trafficking activity. Interactions of specific APM1 protein domains with membrane transporters will be determined.<br/><br/>The proposed project is innovative as it explores a previously undescribed mechanism of protein trafficking and hormonal regulation in plants. Further, the proposed research is likely to provide new insights into gluzincin protein function in both plants and animals. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Manipulation of APM1 function can be used to alter plant form and productivity. As such, the proposed project can potentially increase the value of agricultural and ornamental crops. Further, enhanced understanding of gluzincin regulation derived from this project can lead to the development of new therapies for type II diabetes, obesity, and sterol metabolism. The results will be promulgated by publication in scientific journals and on the laboratory website. Important advances will be publicized in popular scientific literature.<br/><br/>The project will also train at least one PhD student in integrated approaches to membrane biology, physiology, molecular biology, and cell biology. Further, the project will recruit and train one summer undergraduate intern each year in the same techniques in order to encourage those students to pursue a graduate research education and research career. Interns will be recruited from institutions serving traditionally under-represented populations in basic biological research.

This study will conduct a monographic study of the genus and will provide a more accurate basis for recognizing and delineating species. It will involve extensive field collecting of specimens and will improve our knowledge of their distributions in nature. Molecular and morphological data will be collected from these organisms and analyzed to test current hypotheses of species based solely on morphology. Cordyceps is particularly abundant in East Asia and eastern North America, thus this project will include collaborations with Asian scientists. This research will train students and postdoctoral research associates in taxonomy of fungi, an understudied group of organisms for which additional expertise and researchers are needed. This project also contains an extensive World Wide Web component with information on all species of Cordyceps made freely available to the public via the Internet.<br/><br/>Numerous species of Cordyceps are important in agriculture and medicine. Many species of Cordyceps are pathogens of insects and are promising candidates for biological control of insect pests. Biological control is an active area of research that may lessen our dependence on and environmental impact of pesticides. In addition, many species of Cordyceps and the Clavicipitaceae produce numerous biologically active compounds that function in pathogenicity. Some of these compounds have been exploited for use in medicine (e.g., Cyclosporin A from C. subsessilis), but countless others await discovery. An accurate understanding of the species boundaries of these fungi will provide a predictive framework in which more focused and directed research in other fields of biology (e.g., biological control, drug discovery, etc.) can proceed.

For instance, molecular biologists have postulated that DNA must vibrate in order to convert bending strain energy (or writhe) to torsional strain energy (or twist) to initiate the biological processes of transcription and replication. This writhe to twist conversion occurs in DNA supercoils and over lengths scales spanning nanometers to microns. Similarly, the looping of DNA segments when bound to certain proteins is a dynamical process that serves as a regulatory mechanism for gene expression. Our objective is to understand the fundamental dynamical properties of DNA at work in these processes using both theoretical and experimental methods.<br/><br/>Our theoretical effort will lead to a vibration theory for DNA over long spatial/time scales. We approximate a strand of DNA as a long and nonlinear continuum (an elastic rod) that dynamically bends and twists in response to multi-physical (e.g., thermal, electrostatic, fluid, chemical binding) forces. The resulting nonlinear dynamical theory for DNA strands will be used to explore how DNA supercoils and loops evolve and the vibration properties of these states. Our experimental efforts include ambitious studies on single-molecule DNA that employ optical traps to measure dynamic response. The scientific impact of these novel theoretical and experimental studies include: 1) a vibration theory for DNA supercoils on long length/time scales, 2) the experimental characterization of the spatially extended vibration and relaxation times of supercoils, 3) a nonlinear theory that captures the dynamic transitions between supercoiled states, and 4) direct experimental measurements of nonlinear transitions.

This limitation is especially pronounced in scientific applications, where data is inherently uncertain and the models of the domain are constantly evolving. From the users' perspective, the inability to model uncertainty can result in loss of relevant answers, an explosion of irrelevant answers and in no justification of answers. The limitation is deeply rooted in the deterministic paradigm underpinning data management systems today, which is designed to support scalability to large data instances, but is incapable of representing and reasoning about uncertainty.<br/><br/>A new approach to data integration, where uncertainties are handled explic-<br/>Itly, is proposed. Over the past few years, the BioMediator system, which<br/>integrates about a dozen public data sources on genes and proteins, has been available. The group has observed and documented the types of uncertainty that limit the power of any mediator-based integration system like BioMediator. These uncertainties occur at three levels: at the data instance level, at the schema level, and at the user query level. In the new approach, all uncertainties will be made explicit in the system, and represented in a uniform way, using a probabilistic data model. The mediator system supports a query language with SQL but with a modified semantics: the answers to each query are annotated with a probability score, and a lineage<br/>information.<br/><br/>The new work will involve the design of a probabilistic data model, the development of probabilistic query processing and optimization techniques, and the design of user feedback methods. They will build a system, U2 (short for UII { Uncertain<br/>Information Integration ) that will model uncertainty at all levels of the system, including the query language, mediated schema, source mappings and source data. U2 will explain its results to the user and will actively seek to resolve uncertainty when it arises, incorporating feedback from the user where possible. They will extend the BioMediator System and collaborate with the current users of the system.<br/><br/>There are three areas of broader impact. Issues of information integration will be integrated more tightly into the undergraduate and graduate database curriculum<br/>Second, the research will fuel collaboration with biomedical computing research, and will<br/>extend the BioMediator system that is currently in use by practitioners in the field. Finally, tools and services will be made available for public use.

These databases will be the repository of the reproductive biology of fairy-wrens that differ in their social and mating behavior. This study will quantify aspects of the reproductive anatomy of males and females integrating anatomical, physiological, behavioral, and evolutionary methods. To determine how the mating behaviors of females relate to reproductive anatomy and physiology in males, sperm numbers and quality, spermatogenesis, hormone levels, paternity, and morphology will be measured in males of each species. Experiments with captive birds will investigate the reproductive allocation by males to females according to whether the females are social mates or extra-pair mates. Lastly, laboratory studies of histology will investigate cellular aspects of sperm production and the relationship between sperm production in males and sperm storage in females. The research described in this proposal will produce impressive databases that will have to be managed and exploited by cyber approaches to permit compilation and synthesis by the principal investigator, his collaborators, and others with access to these data. Besides providing critical and novel information on the reproductive biology of wild species of birds, this study will add to our understanding of the interaction between social behavior and physiology and the sperm production process, and it will permit the testing of important hypotheses in behavior and evolutionary biology. Furthermore, it contributes to the training of undergraduate and graduate students, strengthens collaborations and interactions between the University of Chicago, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and several Australian universities.

In addition China's legal system is experiencing unprecedented change, including the creation of new legal institutions and procedures. Although formal mediation in court and adjudication are becoming increasingly available, many disputes in China continue to be resolved by informal mediation. This form of mediation is oriented fundamentally by principles of reciprocity with the goal to reestablish harmony and peace in the social order. Yet economic reforms after more than 30 years of collectivization have created inequalities between people.<br/>     This research project examines the influence of the recently introduced rule of law in China on the beliefs and perceptions of Chinese citizens regarding notions of justice, particularly fairness, and related beliefs concerning social relationships and preferred conflict resolution strategies. The study seeks to discover how changes in the system to date have impacted two populations: rural residents as well as urban residents within Hebei province. The data will be collected in two phases. The first phase focuses on collecting narratives and statements about fairness and beliefs about the importance of relationships in the conflict management process, specifically the role of particularistic ties, called guanxi in Chinese. These descriptions will be gathered from a sample of rural and urban residents. The second phase involves the collection of systematic interviews based on instruments developed during the exploratory component of the research with a representative sample of 120 urban and 120 rural households. This will provide data about the distribution of specific opinions, attitudes, and practices regarding dispute resolutions within the larger population. Methods include social network analysis, cultural consensus analysis, and linear modeling approaches. <br/> The broader impact of this project will be the increased availability of empirically derived insights that can aid in China's effort to incorporate elements of the rule of law in a rapidly changing economic environment. More information on the attitudes and expectations regarding legal reforms among the general public is needed given the growing number of challenges to maintain social order that the Chinese government had to face in recent years. Furthermore, this research project will build bridges in the international arena between the United States and China in the difficult to negotiate terrain of collaborative fieldwork. Collaborative research can strengthen continuing cooperation between scholars in the United States and China, especially in the field of cognitive anthropology and social network analysis. The training of graduate students in China and building of trans-pacific ties is likely to provide benefits in future years that may result in further opportunities for knowledge transfer.<br/>

This is achieved by the following planned research activities: (1) model and understand the limits of thermal transpiration in nanosystems, particularly the Knudsen force and thermal diffusion; and (2) design, fabricate and test simple structures to validate the models and to demonstrate the utility of gas flows in metrology. An integrated modeling and experimental approach is proposed and will be carried out by a team led by a theoretician and an experimentalist. <br/><br/>The broader impacts are achieved by (1) creating impact on homeland security, nanotechnology and nanoscience via fundamental studies of nano gas flows and novel concepts for nanostructure metrology and gaseous separation with potential applications in bioterrorism prevention, etc., and (2) making available software or tools resulted from this research to the public. In addition, the research developed in this proposal will be carried out in conjunction with an educational program. The main objective of this one-year project is to develop demonstration modules and simulation projects based on the proposed research for both graduate-level and undergraduate-level courses. These new components will focus on teaching and illustration the fundamentals of nano gas flows, nanofabrication techniques and molecular simulation methods.
0509695	High-Order Numerical Simulation of Focusing Nonlinear Waves in the Non-Paraxial Regime	DMS	COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS	07/01/2005	07/08/2005	Semyon Tsynkov	NC	North Carolina State University	Standard Grant	Leland M.

A standard mathematical model <br/>for describing this type of problems is the nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLS). <br/>By now, this equation is relatively well studied. There are, however, indications <br/>that the NLS model may be oversimplified. An alternative is provided by a more <br/>comprehensive nonlinear Helmholtz equation (NLH), from which the NLS is, in fact, <br/>derived by employing the so-called paraxial approximation and neglecting the <br/>important phenomenon of backscattering. In contradistinction to the NLS, relatively <br/>little is known about the solvability of the NLH and uniqueness of its solutions.<br/>Moreover, this equation presents a considerable challenge for the numerical approach<br/>as well. Nonlinearity is a major hurdle, as it implies that the impinging and<br/>(back)scattered waves cannot be separated. Another key difficulty is the small <br/>magnitude of backscattering compared to that of the forward propagating wave.<br/>In the course of the project, the PI and his colleagues will develop, implement,<br/>and test an efficient numerical procedure for integrating the NLH. It will involve<br/>major modifications and improvements to the previously proposed methodology that<br/>has already proven successful and, in fact, unparalled in the literature. The <br/>methodology employs a high-order finite-difference approximation. Its central <br/>element is a special two-way nonlocal artificial boundary condition that makes the <br/>outer boundary transparent for all the outgoing waves and at the same time is capable <br/>of accurately prescribing the given impinging signal. It is expected that with the <br/>help of this methodology, a valuable new insight will be gained into a number of key <br/>outstanding questions in nonlinear optics, in particular, whether the nonparaxiality <br/>and backscattering may arrest the collapse (blow-up) of focusing nonlinear waves, and <br/>whether the NLH is capable of sustaining the so-called narrow spatial solitons, with <br/>the width on the order of only several wavelengths.<br/><br/>In the course of the project, a numerical methodology will be built to simulate the<br/>propagation of intense laser light through a variety of media and materials. This <br/>methodology has a solid mathematical foundation, and is expected to help address<br/>a number of challenging issues in the theoretical nonlinear optics. In addition<br/>to its potential theoretical merits, the methodology will be useful from the <br/>standpoint of applications as well. Indeed, the propagation of laser beams in <br/>materials is typically accompanied by the phenomena of nonlinear self-focusing and <br/>backscattering. The capability to quantitatively analyze and predict these key <br/>phenomena is extremely important for many of applications in modern science and <br/>engineering. The latter range from remote atmosphere sensing (when an earth-based <br/>powerful laser sends pulses to the sky, and backscattered radiation accounts for a <br/>substantial part of the detected signal), to laser surgery (propagation of laser beams <br/>in tissues), to transmitting information along optical fibers. There are other possible <br/>applications that involve, e.g., interactions between the co-propagating or counter-<br/>propagating laser beams. They may provide a vehicle for designing the so-called all-<br/>optical switches for the next generation of opto-electronic circuits. The proposed <br/>numerical methodology will yield a powerful tool for the accurate and robust analysis <br/>of the foregoing applications, along with many others.

Some of the most important chytrid fungi are members of the Rhizophydium clade or lineage, including the deadly amphibian parasite Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, numerous algal parasites, and soil-inhabiting degraders of refractory materials such as pollen grains, cellulose, chitin, and keratin. The current taxonomic classification, published in 1960, is out of date and is based primarily on obscure morphological features that exhibit plasticity, making it difficult to identify genera and species. Modern biological techniques in gene sequencing and electron microscopy provide an opportunity to re-evaluate these organisms using phylogenetically informative characters, both morphological and molecular. Recent analyses of nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences have helped define membership and revealed unexpected genetic diversity within the Rhizophydium clade, indicating that the biodiversity of this group has been under-appreciated. Drs. Martha Powell and Peter Letcher at the University of Alabama propose to use molecular and zoospore ultrastructural (cell-anatomical) characters to revise the taxonomy of this group. They will expand the geographic areas and habitats sampled to include temperate and tropical rainforests in both hemispheres, the number of genes analyzed, and the details of ultrastructural characters of zoospores. Their goals are to make identification of chytrids easier, document their occurrence in nature by geographic region and habitat, provide laboratory cultures authenticating classical species names, and train a graduate student who is an underrepresented minority student, and work with other collaborators in chytrid systematics and taxonomy. The outcome of the project will be a modern systematic synthesis of the Rhizophydium clade.<br/> The work will be the first monographic synthesis of a large group of chytrids based on both molecular and ultrastructural characters. Through collaboration with scientists in Australia, Argentina, and Costa Rica, the investigators will reveal chytrid diversity in tropical and temperate forests, habitats that are rapidly being degraded by deforestation and other anthropogenic activities. Tools that make chytrid systematics more accessible will be added to an existing web site with digital images, a database of chytrid laboratory cultures, and interactive identification keys. Molecular sequences added to GenBank will be valuable for studies exploring the functional role of chytrids in nature. Working in concert with the Center for Communication and Educational Technology, the graduate student trainee will learn about video production, interactive web education, and appropriate content for students at different levels. Newly produced materials will introduce numerous middle-school students in the Alabama system to fungal biology and chytrid diversity through print and digital formats. Once introduced to chytrids, most students, teachers, and laypersons find these organisms fascinating.

The approach is based on an adaptation of the finite-dimensional equivariant moving frame method previously developed by the principal investigator. Algorithms for directly determining the structure of such symmetry groups and their algebra of differential invariants, for finding explicit, non-invariant solutions, for testing for linearizability and integrability, and for determining conservation laws and integrability constraints for problems arising in the calculus of variations will be developed. Specific applications will include boundary layer and other fluid models, solitons in higher space dimensions, and quasi-geostrophic systems in meteorology. Advances in the geometric foundations of infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-groups are also anticipated. The design and application of general-purpose computer algebra packages for handling the required computations will be an integral part of the project.<br/><br/>Exploitation of symmetry and invariance properties remains one of the most powerful general-purpose mathematical tools for studying and solving the complex nonlinear systems that arise in all areas of applications. The focus of this project will be to develop and exploit new methods for handling infinite-dimensional symmetry groups, which arise in a broad range of applications, including fluid and plasma mechanics, magneto-hydrodynamics, meteorology and climate modeling, relativity and gauge theories from fundamental physics, elasticity, and integrable systems/soliton models, and so on. The results of this project are thus anticipated to have a significant impact on the solution methods and consequent understanding of nonlinear phenomena in physics, engineering, and elsewhere.

The intellectual goal of the research is to address several questions related to this structure, including its size, extent along our line of sight, and the degree of spatial and kinematic symmetry relative to the plane. This information will be used to test models for the origin of this asymmetry, which may involve a triaxial thick disk, a gravitational interaction with the Galactic bar in the disk, or the fossil remnant of a galaxy merger. The research will have broad impact through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students, and by fostering close collaboration between a research extensive university, and two primarily undergraduate institutions.

The rates and mechanisms of processes within the soil zone have a significant impact on events throughout Earth's systems; for example, these processes contribute to nutrient cycling and neutralize acidic precipitation in watersheds. Despite the importance of the soil resource, estimates of soil formation rates are based upon unproven assumptions of steady state and vary widely. However, all estimates agree on a common point: the current estimates of soil erosion rates are one to three orders of magnitude greater than estimates of average soil formation rates, a disturbing conclusion considering the importance of soils to society.<br/><br/>The scientific merit of this proposal lies in addressing a clear need for a better system tracking and disseminating information regarding weathering and soil formation. Our proposed initiative will investigate the following question: How does Earth's weathering engine transform rock into soil to nourish ecosystems, shape terrestrial landscapes, and control atmospheric carbon dioxide? The answer requires coupling physical, chemical, and biological processes over a range of spatial and temporal scales and involves a variety of scientific and engineering disciplines.<br/><br/>Traditionally, terrestrial low-temperature geochemists and soil chemists have worked in small, single or double PI projects. Very few large, multi-PI projects that cross scales and disciplines have developed from within this community. In contrast, among other scientific communities, large programs have developed to organize scientists into coordinated multi-university teams. For example, IRIS and COSEE have been extremely successful in generating enthusiasm and interest in the seismology and oceanography communities. We propose a new paradigm, a Weathering System Science Consortium (WSSC), to forge this type of multi-PI approach to weathering science and environmental biogeochemistry among terrestrial low-temperature geochemists and soil chemists/biologists.<br/><br/> To lay the groundwork for the proposed WSSC, we are requesting funding for two workshops, a symposium at the 18th World Congress of Soil Science in 2006 in Philadelphia that will feature leading scientists who will discuss research frontiers and needs concerning the critical zone, and a database specialist. The current vision for WSSC incorporates four components: 1) a set of node sites for data collection; 2) a network of backbone soil sites that will be investigated for a standard set of weathering parameters over a range of depths; 3) technical support for instrument and sample node sites and backbone sites and coordinated data management and sample storage systems; and 4) the integration of these efforts through a variety of community-building approaches.<br/><br/> The broader impacts of this funding request include the following: 1) improved understanding of the current diversity of questions within the fields of weathering science and environmental biogeochemistry; 2) improved understanding by US scientists of weathering initiatives occurring abroad; 3) development of a coordinated plan to quantify weathering rates in diverse settings; 4) development of a plan to standardize data gathering in the field of weathering science; 5) development of a plan to store and disseminate data from weathering sites worldwide for use by the entire natural sciences community; and 6) organization of the scientific community to investigate fundamental questions in weathering science with great relevance to human society and natural ecosystems.

The instrument will have the following technical features: a Schottky field emission source; EDS and EBSD; remote operation; variable pressure and good low-voltage operation. The state-of-the-art microscope will be used for research into a broad range of problems related to nanotechnology, among them: orientation mapping and the local measurement of strain in polycrystalline samples and their application to electromigration; the patterning of perfect crystal epitaxy on sapphire for improved GaN growth for LEDs; micromechanical testing of nanoscale materials; the detailed characterization of grain boundaries for studies of grain-boundary segregation and of metal forging; biomimetic fibrillar interfaces for adhesion; welding of superaustinitic stainless steels; the structures produced by laser engineered net shaping. The microscope will also be used for an extensive set of outreach and educational programs. The Lehigh Microscopy School, held each year provides the premier training in scanning electron microscopy and so brings the latest advances in the field to industrial microscopists. Remote operation of the microscope will facilitate collaborative research with many other universities as well as bringing access to high-tech excitement to middle- and high- school students.<br/><br/><br/>The electron microscope plays a very special role in contemporary science and engineering. So much of our present technological strength comes from our understanding of the relation between structures on the nanoscale (roughly 1,000 times smaller than the diameter of a hair) and the properties of objects on the human scale. The electron microscope is central to this since it is the most powerful instrument for investigating such small structures. The new scanning electron microscope at Lehigh University will greatly enhance what is already a major program in these areas of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The microscope will also contribute greatly to outreach and education programs, especially through the Lehigh Microscopy School - the leading courses for basic and advanced training in scanning electron microscopy. It will be possible to operate the microscope remotely, which will be important for research collaboration with other universities. Lehigh will develop an outreach program in which middle- and high- school students are able to operate the microscope to view samples they submit. Among many research programs using the new instrument will be programs leading to: better performance in computer chips; better light sources; better micro-machines; and the design of improved adhesion methods by imitating the structures on the feet of lizards.

In addition, extensive lecture notes are now available on the Internet. Many students are left with little incentive to attend class, much less participate. Traditional instructional methods do not provide much opportunity for students to critically think through arguments being developed. <br/><br/>In the geosciences the concepts being developed are often well illustrated through imagery and/or animation. But even the most stunning of images or movies, while motivating, offers the students only passive participation in their learning. This project couples the rich imagery of the geosciences, forthcoming advances in technology and new pedagogical approaches with the goal of improving student learning and engagement in survey-level geosciences classes. Peer Instruction techniques are being used in two large geosciences classes at the University of Michigan through use of interactive spatial concept challenges utilizing wireless PocketPC computers. While the technologies to be employed (browser, PocketPC, wireless networks) are largely off-the-shelf technologies and the success of Peer Instruction techniques in undergraduate science classes are well documented, the combination is not widely employed due to cost, perceived level of effort to implement and a relatively modest volume of data documenting their value to student learning.
0513433	Collaborative Research: An Adaptive hp-Finite Element Method for Two-Fluid Flows with Topological Change	DMS	COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS	07/15/2005	06/20/2006	Luigi Martinelli	NJ	Princeton University	Standard Grant	Leland M. Jameson	06/30/2009	$76,620.00		martinel@princeton.edu	Off. of Research & Proj. Admin.	Princeton	NJ	085442020	6092583090	MPS	1271	0000, 9263, OTHR	$0.00	The investigators propose a methodology for performing highly resolved simulations of multi-fluid flow problems with topological change. The methodology combines a mesh deformation and adaptation algorithm and an hp-finite element method to obtain high spatial accuracy. Multi-scale resolution is provided by using a mesh refinement criterion that detects oncoming topological change and automatically refines the mesh. To allow topology change (reconnection of fluid interfaces), a level-set formulation is used in a small spatial and temporal window around the topology change event. Once the topology change is complete, the window is removed and the high-accuracy deforming mesh simulation is continued. This approach will provide better accuracy and efficiency than previously possible for multi-fluid problems with topological change. The techniques developed can also be used with formulations such as molecular dynamics for the topological change window and thus they are the step towards a first-principles prediction of practical problems with topological change.<br/><br/>Examples of flows having topological change include wave crashing, cavitation, bubbly flows, boiling, atomization, mold-filling, liquid jets in a gas, coating flows, etc. The design of many practical devices hinges on an accurate prediction of these flows. One such example is liquid fuel injection into either jet engines or internal combustion engines. The performance of these devices is strongly dependent on the performance of the fuel injectors. (Most people are familiar with the idea of getting their automobile fuel injectors cleaned to increase efficiency and reduce pollutant production). Injectors are currently designed almost entirely using a trial and error approach because current analytical and numerical tools cannot predict the process. This investigation aims to develop a simulation technique that will provide accurate and reliable predictions of practical flows having topological change.

Thus, the availability and quality of measurements is of fundamental importance to continued progress in these areas. There have been a number of research projects, such as IDMaps, NIMI, King, and Internet Weather Service, that collect general Internet measurements, and then answer specific measurement requests by estimating the requested values from the collected generic data. At the same time, a need often arises for a focused, on-demand measurement of a certain feature. As a typical example, a company selecting a content delivery network for accelerating its Web site may need to compare the performance of several content delivery networks with respect to a specific client population. While some platforms (most notably, Scriptroute service deployed on PlanetLab and, commercially, Keynote Systems) offer measuring hosts to serve this need, they can provide only a limited number of measuring hosts, and hence a limited perspective on the Internet performance. It is clearly not feasible for a single company to provide a representative sample of the entire Internet. Worse, having a limited number of well-known measuring hosts allows systems being measured to game the system, by optimizing specifically for those hosts. Finally, the closed proprietary system for Internet measurements limits user choice of the types of measurements. For example, in HTTP, a measurement of a page download done with and without pipelining and persistent connections, and with different caching settings at the client, would yield very different results. One cannot rely on the prowess of a single company to timely detect all the trends in HTTP (or other Internet applications), and provide the entire menu of various modes of client operation. Given the scale of the Internet and the unpredictability of the needs for particular measurements, these limitations can only be overcome by harnessing the capacity of the Internet at large itself. <br/><br/>The principal investigators (PIs) propose an open Internet-wide system, named DipZoom (for Deep Internet Performance Zoom), which is based on peer-to-peer principles and which would enable focused measurements and numerous measuring choices. There are two key ideas behind DipZoom. First, rather than trying to build a global-scale measuring platform, the PIs propose a matchmaking service that merely provides plumbing to connect measurement providers and requesters. The measurements themselves are left to outside providers. Second, they will use a market approach as an effective regulator of system behavior without rigid built-in control mechanisms. Together, these two ideas would create a marketplace for Internet measurements: an open ecosystem where anyone can offer measurements from their computers and other computing devices, and anyone can request measurements. The hope is that the combination of an open system with market forces will encourage great and unpredictable innovation and diversity in the offered measurements and measuring devices. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Such a system would significantly enhance our ability to gain insight into Internet characteristics, enable companies to optimize and monitor their Internet sites for focused client populations, and would make gaming the system infeasible due to the number of potential measuring hosts.<br/><br/>As the first step in realizing this vision, the PIs will concentrate on building the case for DipZoom during the current award period. This involves obtaining experimental data that would demonstrate DipZoom's benefits in gaining insight into the Internet performance, and detailed conceptual design for the system that would lay the groundwork for a future DipZoom implementation.

The leaf is a ground state lateral organ; the developmental mechanisms generating leaves are repeated and modified during development of inflorescences and flowers. Thus, an understanding of leaf development is central to our comprehension of overall plant development. Previous molecular genetic analyses in diverse plant species have generated testable models for mechanisms of leaf initiation and growth. In addition, comparative approaches are important for better understanding how diverse leaf morphologies have evolved, and may be utilized for agronomic advantage in the future. This research will exploit recessive mutations that affect the initiation and/or expansion of leaves. Experiments will investigate the expression patterns and functions of these genes, helping to elucidate more about the development and morphological evolution of leaves. Three specific aims are proposed.<br/><br/> (1) The maize/Arabidopsis genes NARROW SHEATH (NS)/PRESSED FLOWER (PRS) are required for the initiation of lateral leaf domains from shoot meristems. Maize and Arabidopsis leaves are simple, whereas tomato forms compound leaves comprised of many leaflets. The NS/PRS gene will be cloned from tomato, and molecular-genetic analyses will determine the function of this gene during the development of compound tomato leaves. <br/><br/> (2) The developmental timing and meristematic tissue layer-specificity of PRS accumulation and function will be analyzed with fluorescently tagged proteins and specific antibodies. These experiments will investigate mechanisms of PRS non-cell autonomy, wherein PRS functions beyond those cells and tissues in which PRS is expressed. <br/><br/>(3) The RAGGEDSEEDLING2 gene will be identified and analyses of RGD2 expression during maize development will generate models for how RGD2 functions during the lateral growth and expansion of leaves.<br/><br/>These research activities will be performed in parallel with efforts to introduce middle school aged students in Georgia to plant biological research.

The insect order Coleoptera (beetles) is an obvious<br/>starting point for this endeavor because it is the largest order of insects<br/>and constitutes over 25% of total animal diversity worldwide. Likewise,<br/>Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) is an obvious place to begin<br/>because it is a national treasure constituting one of the most biologically<br/>diverse and unique landscapes in North America and is located in one of the<br/>most densely populated parts of the U.S. This project will be conducted by a<br/>team of 44 cooperating scientists engaging in an ambitious effort to<br/>completely document beetle diversity in GSMNP. Methods will include<br/>fieldwork by scientists, students and volunteers, morphological and<br/>molecular analyses, and computer databasing. The project is fully integrated<br/>with other teams of researchers conducting biotic surveys as part of the All<br/>Taxa Biodiversity Inventory (ATBI) in GSMNP, including data and specimen<br/>exchange, joint collecting events (bioblitzes), and networking at the<br/>annual ATBI Conference. Products from the Coleoptera project of the ATBI<br/>will include computer generated identification guides, internet species<br/>profiles, and research publications. Project scientists have estimated that<br/>3000 species will be recorded, representing 105 different beetle families.<br/>Previous work has already documented 25 species new to science and this<br/>number is expected to double during the four-year project. Ultimately, the<br/>beetle fauna of GSMNP will be the best documented in the entire world. The<br/>project is coordinated with Discover Life in America, Inc (DLIA), an<br/>organization devoted to documenting life in U.S. national parks that serves<br/>as a liaison between our team and participating units in the National Parks<br/>Service, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and National Biological Information<br/>Infrastructure (NBII).<br/><br/><br/>The Coleoptera project is a significant part of a larger endeavor to assist<br/>national parks and other conservation areas in the development of inventory<br/>methods to compile data about biological diversity. This work is being<br/>conducted under the broad umbrella of the GSMNP ATBI to document all species<br/>within the park. Already, other national parks are implementing the<br/>synergistic model established at GSMNP. Completion of the beetle survey<br/>will serve these broader goals by demonstrating that the single most diverse<br/>group of animals can be successfully documented. Beyond this, parks and<br/>reserves in China and Nepal are closely monitoring this survey in developing<br/>initiatives to save habitats and preserve biodiversity there. The education<br/>components of this project will transfer basic knowledge of the importance<br/>of all living things using beetles as examples to the youth of America<br/>through the classroom and positive interactions with scientists in the<br/>field. Products that will be available through the web have the potential<br/>to teach millions of people about biodiversity and the importance of knowing<br/>and understanding the organisms that share this world with us.

Brodl	07/31/2010	$200,000.00	David Peak	kmott@biology.usu.edu	Sponsored Programs Office	Logan	UT	843221415	4357971226	BIO	7473, 7657	9183, BIOT	$0.00	Stomata are tiny pores on the surfaces of leaves that permit gases to diffuse between the atmosphere and the airspaces inside the plant. As such, they face the challenge of allowing ample CO2 to enter the leaf to support photosynthesis, while at the same time restricting evaporative water loss to prevent desiccation. To accomplish this, the two cells forming the pore (termed guard cells) change shape, thereby changing the pore aperture, in response to numerous environmental and physiological cues. These changes in shape result from water influx and efflux, primarily driven by ion transport processes, and occur on time scales on the order of minutes. Although each pair of guard cells responds directly to environmental cues, stomata occasionally display complex and apparently organized, non-uniform distributions of apertures, even when environmental conditions are uniform. Patches of hundreds to thousands of stomata behave differently from neighboring patches, and often this collective behavior moves about the surface of the leaf in apparently unpredictable ways. It has been proposed that such patches arise from stomatal interactions; i.e., the movements of one stoma cause neighboring stomata to move as well. These interactions have been shown to exist, but little is known of their characteristics or biological function. <br/>It has recently been suggested that stomatal patchiness might represent a form of information processing called emergent, distributed computation. Studied by computer scientists for years, emergent, distributed computation has often been proposed as a model for biological information processing. It occurs in a locally connected network of processors that solve a problem at the level of the entire network without the aid of a central controller capable of coordinating distantly separated processors. Despite the limitation of local information exchange, the solution to the problem can emerge when the processors interact such that large patches of them behave collectively. The coherent motion of such patches serves to coordinate the entire network even though there is no mechanism for doing so directly. Intriguingly, stomatal patches are statistically indistinguishable from patches associated with emergent, distributed computation, and it has been suggested that stomata may use this mode of information processing to determine the appropriate average aperture for the entire leaf.<br/>The research proposed will provide a detailed analysis of interactions among stomata to better understand how complex patterns of aperture are formed on the leaf. Known mechanisms for interaction will be characterized in detail, and new mechanisms will be investigated. The resulting data will analyzed to determine how the stomatal interactions might produce complex patterns of aperture, and to determine if these patterns are the result of distributed, emergent computation. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Because stomata control the fluxes of CO2 and H2O between plants and the atmosphere, their behavior is important for plant survival, plant water use, productivity of natural and agricultural systems, and global climate modeling. All of these areas will benefit from new insights into the mechanisms controlling stomatal aperture. In addition, the research represents an unusual and provocative combination of information theory, computer science, and biology, one that holds the promise of adding novel and exciting new insights into the mechanisms by which organisms process information and respond to their environment. Perhaps most importantly, it also provides a unique opportunity for educating students across traditional disciplinary boundaries.

0519211	Testosterone in Female Songbirds: Natural, Sexual, and Correlated Responses to Selection	IOS	BEHAVIORAL SYSTEMS CLUSTER, ANIMAL BEHAVIOR	08/01/2005	05/05/2008	Ellen Ketterson	IN	Indiana University	Continuing grant	daniel wiegmann	07/31/2009	$390,756.00		ketterso@indiana.edu	509 E 3RD ST	Bloomington	IN	474013654	8128550516	BIO	7472, 7659	1096, 9178, 9183, 9251, BIOT, SMET	$0.00	Males and females are similar in some ways and different in others. Differences may arise because one sex is subject to greater reproductive competition (sexual selection) or because the sexes differ in their ecology (natural selection). Because males and females share a common genome, they are also subject to correlated responses to selection, which occur when genetic variants favored by selection in one sex ('like father, like son') are carried along in the other sex ('like father, like daughter'). Correlated responses may serve as an evolutionary constraint if the attributes that are beneficial to one sex are disadvantageous to the other sex.<br/> Steroid hormones are among the proximate mechanisms that lead to sex differences. They may act early in development to organize tissues or later in life to activate trait expression. When hormonal effects are similar in males and females, there is potential for correlated responses to selection. The focus of this proposal is the steroid hormone testosterone (T) and its integrating effect on sex differences in adult males and females of a songbird species, the dark-eyed junco. The research has four objectives. The first is to experimentally elevate testosterone (T) in females and measure its effect on the female's phenotype (e.g. appearance, behavior). The second is to determine whether elevated T is adaptive or maladaptive in females. The third is to assess the potential for correlated responses within and between the sexes by measuring change in T after exposure to a fixed dose of a hormonal stimulant (GnRH). The fourth is to assess sexual independence by comparing the role of T in the activation of aggressive behavior in males and females. <br/> Research described in this proposal will add to an already impressive 20-year database, provide opportunities for training future scientists of diverse backgrounds in the conduct of cybernetics, and laboratory and field experiments that address the integration of proximate and ultimate explanations for biological differences. This extensive database will provide fodder for continued synthesis, compilation, and cyber exploitation, and will make a significant contribution to this principle investigator's work, her collaborators, and others who will have access to this gold mine. This cyber research program will also enrich courses taught at Indiana University and elsewhere. Potential societal implications of the findings to be expected include: (1) the impact of hormonally active agents in the environment; and (2) a greater understanding of the relationship between sex and gender.

Because ionic liquids have no measurable vapor pressure, these materials are being studied as possible green replacements for conventional volatile organic solvents in many reaction and separation processes. The goal will be to combine information collected from a number of different experimental measurements to develop a fundamental understanding of the interactions governing transport in ionic liquids. Measurements will include solute permeability through supported ionic liquid membranes, solubility of target solutes and ionic liquid viscosity and density at different dissolved solute concentrations. Measurements will be conducted over a range of pressures and temperatures. Supported ionic liquids membranes will be prepared from porous alumina membranes with well-defined pore geometries. These easily characterized membranes will permit calculation of solute diffusion coefficients by combining information from the membrane permeability measurements with measured solubility values. Results will be examined to answer some fundamental questions about the important phenomena governing processes that will utilize ionic liquids. An examination of peak shifts in NMR spectra should help identify the constituent groups in the ionic liquid that interact with the dissolved solute. In terms of the broader impacts, the proposed work will provide property information about a class of materials that may be important in the design of environmentally benign chemical processes. Students who will work on this project will be encouraged to consider a variety of questions that will ultimately impact the applicability of ionic liquids in the chemical process and energy industries. Through their experience on this project, these students will develop an understanding of environmentally conscious engineering and the importance of thinking beyond end-of-pipe solutions to emissions problems. This project will provide information useful for the industrial application of a new class of environmentally friendly solvents.

The importance of such<br/>theories became clear in late eighties after Witten's<br/>papers. Witten suggested a more general way of construction of<br/>topological quantum field theories and used it to find new<br/>interesting models. Among the most important topological theories<br/>are Chern-Simons theory, suggested by PI and Witten and solved by<br/>Witten, and Witten's topological sigma-models (A-model and<br/>B-model). Chern-Simons theory was very useful in knot theory.<br/>Topological sigma-models, especially mirror symmetry between<br/>A-and B-models, were used to obtain striking results in<br/>enumerative algebraic geometry. Topological version of gauge<br/>theories led to remarkable developments in the theory of<br/>four-dimensional and three-dimensional manifolds. One can say<br/>that topological quantum field theories opened the way for<br/>applications of ideas borrowed from physics to pure<br/>mathematics. However, these theories were used also as a powerful<br/>instrument in string/M-theory. It was shown by Witten that<br/>starting with any N=2 superconformal theory one can construct<br/>topological quantum field theories by means of so called<br/>twisting. This means, in particular,that string theory with N=2<br/>superconformal target has topological sectors, that can be<br/>analyzed more easily than complete theory. Topological sectors<br/>served as a testing ground for many important conjectures. From<br/>the other side, for any critical string we can obtain<br/>two-dimensional topological theory considering matter fields<br/>together with ghosts. More generally, two-dimensional topological<br/>quantum field theory obeying certain conditions can be coupled<br/>to gravity; the resulting theory can be considered as string<br/>theory.<br/><br/>The present proposal is devoted to some problems related to<br/>topological quantum field theories. In particular, we would like<br/>to relate recent developments in knot theory to the theory of<br/>topological strings; it seems that this relation should lead to<br/>essential progress both in knot theory and in string theory. We<br/>are planning to apply methods of number theory to topological<br/>string theory. Our projects are interdisciplinary; their<br/>realization will be important both for mathematics and<br/>theoretical physics.

These measurements are to be made in conjunction with an existing NSF-funded project that is studying flows of nutrients and carbon at the Imnavait Creek watershed near the Toolik Field Station at Toolik Lake, Alaska. The field campaign is to be conducted at the peak of the tundra ecosystem growing season (late July/early August) to enable direct measurements of the isoprene fluxes using equipment from the existing project. These measurements will be supplemented with leaf level data to gain information about other BVOC emissions such as higher terpenes. Arctic tundra ecosystems are undergoing significant changes due to high latitude warming, and BVOC measurements have the potential to be a sensitive indicator of these changes since emissions depend strongly on the state of the ecosystem.<br/><br/>This project addresses important issues regarding atmospheric processes in ecosystems that are very sensitive to climate change, and will thus benefit society. This award supports an early career scientist for a timely research opportunity.

The developed techniques will used to increase the scalability of problems solved in this research area. Specifically, the research will integrate novel decomposition techniques, called branch decomposition techniques, with the existing traditional methodology to find new inequalities for the polyhedra related to the problems of interest. The developed techniques will be compared with other exact algorithms in the literature to validate and assess the computational efficacy of the techniques.<br/><br/>If successful, the results will increase the scalability and efficiency of solving the problems of interest. Applications of these problems are in fields seeing increased demand for services. In addition, the results can be used to solve other related computationally hard problems in operations research which have a wide range of applications apart from the aforementioned applications. Thus, the results will advance the knowledge base in operations research and offer new effective techniques for solving large-scale problems related to real-world applications.

Inc.<br/><br/><br/> The reliance on linear time invariant models for control design has reached a level of maturity that is often characterized by limitations on possible performance improvements in many applications, a classical example being the hard disk drive servo control problem. The use of more realistic nonlinear models for nonlinear control design has been an active area of research which produced many new control methodologies during the recent years. Despite these remarkable advances, the control of nonlinear systems is still at its infancy. The purpose of this project is the development of nonlinear adaptive control methodologies for a wide class of nonlinear plants with partially or fully unknown nonlinearities with guaranteed pre specified tracking accuracy. These nonlinear techniques will be used to address the servo control problem of hard disk drives which is known to be one of the most challenging and exciting control problems. The discrete time counterparts of the developed control methodologies for continuous time systems will be generated and implemented on a disk drive test bed donated to the project by ACORN Technologies Inc. <br/><br/> The development of nonlinear adaptive control methodologies is fundamental to automation where high accuracy and performance is required despite environmental conditions, imperfections in manufacturing, worn out parts with time etc. The implementation of such sophisticated control techniques is now possible due to the advances in electronics and availability of low cost, high power computational tools. Nonlinear adaptive control techniques to be developed under this project can be used to push the performance envelope beyond the limits achievable using traditional control techniques in a wide range of applications leading to higher efficiency and lower cost operations. Tracking the data tracks in a computer disk drive for example more accurately will allow the squeeze of more tracks on a disk leading to smaller size disks with the same storage capacity. While the primary application to test the developed control techniques is the accurate tracking of data tracks in a disk drive, the techniques will be applicable to a wide range of applications involving high accuracy tracking and performance. Areas such as robotics, manufacturing, aerospace, chemical and mechanical systems which involve processes where accurate tracking and precision, despite manufacturing and environmental imperfections, is very crucial will benefit from the proposed research.
0538363	Genome Organization and Transmission Genetics of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi	MCB	Genetic Mechanisms	05/12/2005	02/21/2006	Teresa Pawlowska	NY	Cornell Univ - State: AWDS MADE PRIOR MAY 2010	Continuing grant	Vicki B. Vance	02/28/2007	$429,581.00		tep8@cornell.edu	373 Pine Tree Road	Ithica	NY	148502488	6072555014	BIO	1112	1116, 9109, BIOT	$0.00	The goal of this project is to uncover genome organization (size and ploidy) and the reproductive mode of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi, Glomeromycota) using genetic, population genetic and cytological approaches. AM fungi colonize roots of most land plants, including many crop species, where they facilitate uptake of minerals from the soil. Consequently, they are a key component of terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, AM fungi remain one of the least genetically understood microorganisms. With no sexual morphology, AM fungi are hypothesized to reproduce clonally, but there are theoretical and empirical reasons to doubt this hypothesis. To select tools needed to challenge the hypothesis of clonality, a thorough analysis of genome organization will be performed. Next, patterns of genetic variation in a field population of an AM fungus will be analyzed to detect signatures of recombination or clonality. This work will be supplemented by a cytological study tracing the fate of nuclei during AM fungal life cycle, for which genetically transformed strains expressing GFP-labeled histone will be constructed to enable visualization of nuclei in living cells. <br/>Understanding the genome organization of AM fungi is essential for future sequencing of AM fungal genomes. Reproductive mode is a single most important piece of information needed to develop transmission genetics of AM fungi, which will be greatly aided by the genetic transformation system developed in this study. Another product of this work, genetic markers, will augment the phenotype-based taxonomy of AM fungi. All these tools will enable systematic evaluation of the role of AM fungi in nature and agrosystems, and facilitate breeding (if reproduction is sexual) or selection (if reproduction is clonal) of AM fungi for specific purposes of improved plant mineral nutrition, pest control, protection from drought, salinity, or toxic metal stress. Glomeromycota, if proven clonal, may represent an ancient asexual lineage and they may offer a system to study mechanisms of long-term evolutionary survival in the absence of meiotic recombination.

The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.<br/><br/>This award will support a twenty-two-month research fellowship by Dr. Joshua A. Henry to work with Dr. Bengt H. Kasemo at Chalmers Institute of Technology in Goteborg, Sweden.<br/><br/>The PI's dissertation research focused on the effect of surface chemistry on the quality factor, or Q, of micromechanical resonators. The Q, which is essentially the number of cycles an oscillator completes before damping out, must be high for applications requiring great force sensitivity and narrow bandwidths (e.g. sensors and cell phones, respectively), however researchers have noted decreasing Q with decreasing resonator size. The PI's research has demonstrated that a surprising amount of this drop in Q, in silicon oscillators, is attributable to the chemical termination of the surface. They have characterized a number of surface chemistries and demonstrated that surface-induced losses in Q are particularly acute at the nanoscale. Surfaces are also important in optical phenomena at the nanoscale. The energy in light-induced excitations in metal nanoparticles, called surface plasmons, have the potential to carry out useful processes such as single molecule spectroscopy, photocatalytic cleaning of gas emissions and water, and improving solar energy conversion via photovoltaic cells or solar-driven decomposition of water to H2. At the same time these phenomena contain a number of challenging physics questions, related to the involved excitation and de-excitation mechanisms, including nanoparticle (surface) plasmons, their decay into electron-hole pairs and interaction of the latter with HOMO/LUMO orbitals of adsorbed molecules. In this study the dependence of these mechanisms on particle size, morphology and interparticle spacing will be probed using a combination of nanofabrication, chemistry, high-resolution microscopies and surface sensitive spectroscopies. <br/><br/>Chalmers University has the facilities and expertise necessary to complete this study. Technologies that conserve or generate meaningful amounts of energy renewably still face significant innovation challenges. The scientific strengths of other countries must be leveraged to innovate the necessary technologies. Research in photovoltaic (solar) cells and related technologies in European countries is one of those strengths. Taking advantage of this strength to enable several potential biological and environmental applications is at the center of this proposal. The application aims of this project are executed in collaboration with some of the top group in the world in catalysis, photovaltaics and biosensing.
0538146	2005 FASEB Summer Research Conference on Ciliate Molecular Biology to be held August 3-8, 2005 at IL Ciocco in Tuscany, Italy	MCB	Genetic Mechanisms	08/01/2005	07/27/2005	Judith Van Houten	MD	Federation of Amer Societies For Exper Biology	Standard Grant	Susan Porter Ridley	07/31/2006	$9,000.00	Theodore Clark	Judith.Vanhouten@uvm.edu	9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE	Bethesda	MD	208143998	3016347013	BIO	1112	9179, 9183, SMET	$0.00	The Eleventh International Meeting on Ciliate Molecular Biology will be held as a FASEB Summer Research Conference at Il Ciocco in Tuscany, Italy, from August 3 through August 8, 2005. The meeting will bring together 160-170 scientists from a variety of countries. Using ciliated protozoa as their model system, these researchers employ molecular approaches to investigate diverse biological problems. Historically, work on ciliated protozoa has provided a number of remarkable insights into important and universal biological processes, such as the erosion of the ends of chromosomes during ageing and the remodeling of chromosomes during development. The keynote presentation will be made by Joel Rosenbaum of Yale University on Control of Ciliary and Flagellar Growth: Dynamics of Intraflagellar Transport, an important topic relevant to cilia wherever they occur - in lungs, sperm, kidneys, embryonic development and elsewhere. The continued development of molecular tools for ciliates has made them favorable models for studying numerous biological processes shared with a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms, including humans. This meeting seeks to bring together investigators who work in these various fields but who are united by their use of ciliates as models, in order to foster the efficient exchange of unpublished research results and technical advances. <br/><br/>There will be nine platform sessions, two workshops and two poster sessions. The topics of the platform sessions represent areas of active ciliate research. The topic areas include DNA and chromatin, ranging from genome organization and evolution through the use of genomic information; cell structure and function, including motility, development and environmental sensing; and technologies for the study of ciliates. The workshops will be on Genomics and Ciliates in the Classroom. The genomics workshop is intended to further develop the ciliate genome sequencing efforts, as well as bring the use of the genomic information to a new level, and to enable researchers to share information on the fast-emerging post-genomic resources for ciliates. The second workshop focuses on Ciliates in the Classroom. Ciliated protozoa have long been used as teaching tools because of their complex biology, large size, and simple culture requirements. Inspired by the 2003 FASEB meeting, many conferees have further developed teaching modules (primarily for undergraduate courses) that utilize ciliates and have provided the information on web sites. The workshop will provide a forum for not only exchanging such teaching tools, but also organizing a global distributed ciliate molecular biology project for undergraduates.<br/><br/>Funding from the National Science Foundation will be used to help defray the costs of attendance at the meeting for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and beginning faculty.

While structural genomics projects are providing the necessary data, they are not being used to reveal the general principles underlying biological mechanism. Sequence, structure, bioinformatics, and biophysical methods will be used to characterize the molecular function sites of 6 protein superfamilies, focusing on the following objectives: 1) characterizing the sequence and structure of functional-site features and using the results to develop methods for clustering the peroxiredoxin family; 2) analyzing the electrostatics, including ionizable residue pKas, residues affecting these pKas, and electrostatic potential, at peroxiredoxin functional sites and testing them experimentally; 3) integrating the electrostatic, sequence and structural information to create a robust profiling method that can identify peroxiredoxin subfamilies; and 4) using it to create active-site signatures and profiles for a well-studied and important set of protein superfamilies. Crossing the gap from molecular function to biological mechanism requires integrating sequence, structure, and physical-chemical data. The peroxiredoxin superfamily makes a good test case, because of the emerging body of interesting sequence, structure, and function information, much of it generated by the Poole group. Combined strengths of the computational and experimental groups involved in the project will allow iterative improvements to knowledge in both areas. The detailed functional site analysis of 5 other superfamilies will yield insights into biological mechanisms, leading to hypotheses that can be experimentally tested. In the long term, the resulting methods will enable more accurate functional site identification from sequence. <br/><br/>The development of general concepts for identifying and classifying molecular functional site features of proteins will improve the ability to predict molecular function, to design enzymes with novel functions and mechanisms, and to determine what molecules bind to proteins of unknown structure and function. Wake Forest University is a leading liberal arts institution, where professors have regular and intense intellectual interaction with undergraduate and graduate students. The institution fosters the Teacher/Scholar ideal: professors are active researchers, engaging students both in the classroom and the laboratory. Students involved in this project will gain leading-edge, cross-disciplinary molecular biophysics training that will fuel their success in productive scientific careers. In addition, two of the investigators teach an interdisciplinary molecular biophysics course in which students are introduced to computational methods and work to interpret data in terms of protein structure. This past fall, graduate and undergraduate students from physics, biochemistry, chemistry, and biology, as well as researchers from a local biopharmaceutical company, studied the peroxiredoxin family in this course and were introduced to the ideas and communication skills necessary in an interdisciplinary research project.
0520619	Acquisition of Instruments to Measure Visual Bias of Occluded Auditory Signals in Three-Dimensional Space	BCS	MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION	08/01/2005	07/22/2005	James Schirillo	NC	Wake Forest University	Standard Grant	John E. Yellen	07/31/2008	$57,147.00		schirija@wfu.edu	1834 Wake Forest Road	Winston Salem	NC	271098758	3367585888	SBE	1189	0000, OTHR	$0.00	With support from a National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation Award, Wake Forest University's Department of Psychology will acquire stereovision equipment from Cambridge Research Systems and audio equipment allowing for head related transfer functions (HFTFs) and binaural-related impulse-responses (BRIRs) from Tucker-Davis Technologies. This equipment will be located in an audiometric sound chamber and designed to produce a three-dimensional audio-visual environment to measure the multisensory localization of visually occluded auditory signals. It is a custom design and the only one of its kind in the United States.<br/><br/>Multisensory integration is typically studied with two-dimensional stimuli. Designing experiments in a three-dimensional environment is a novel approach and has the broader impact of allowing occluding objects to be added to the scene. This ecologically valid condition is the one most encountered in nature, allowing it to tap accurately the design underlying the human multisensory system. Recent advances in environmental acoustics and stereoscopic viewing technology offer an exciting opportunity to explore how an object's surface properties affect 3-dimensional auditory localization. How an object's opacity or transparency influences the extent to which flashes of light can bias the perception of where a sound burst originates has significant theoretical, physiological, and practical implications for the field of multisensory integration. The hypothesis that the opacity of an object constrains the extent to which a light can bias the perceived location of a sound will be tested for the first time.<br/><br/>The results can potentially change how psychophysicists model auditory occlusion in 3-dimensional space. Current 2-dimensional models prevent exploring how the significant ecological constraint of occlusion affects auditory localization. Likewise, the results can change what neuroscientists consider to be the type of contextual factors that can influence the receptive field properties of multisensory neurons. In nature, receptive fields are seldom free of obstacles. The ways in which the qualities of such objects influence receptive fields will lead to a better understanding of receptive fields' organization. The results can also change how engineers design environments, such as cockpits, to account for how objects affect the accurate localization of sound sources. Thus, the ecological validity in studying the cross-modal processes of stereoscopic visual input and acoustical head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to determine how surface properties affect sound localization will expand current theories of multisensory integration. The equipment will be used by multiple researchers, mostly psychophysicists and neurobiologists, at the professional, graduate and undergraduate level across two campuses (e.g., Wake Forest College of Art and Sciences, and Wake Forest University of Medicine's Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy).

The principal technique to be used is infrared cavity ring-down spectroscopy to detect gas-phase products evolved from the irradiated surfaces. A secondary goal is to study the ozonolysis of unsaturated organics.<br/><br/>The results of this research will be applicable to aerosol particles which play a pivotal role in the Earth's atmosphere, from providing a unique heterogeneous environment for chemical reactions to serving as condensation nuclei for cloud formation and efficiently scattering solar radiation. Because aerosol particles are continuously exposed to solar radiation during the daytime, they can potentially serve as media or, in special cases, as catalysts for photochemical processes in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>This research will be useful for establishing rational environmental standards for particulate matter in the lower atmosphere, and for improving the predictive power of air pollution and global climate models. Understanding photochemical properties of aerosol particles will help to better predict their atmospheric fates and environmental impacts, and ultimately reduce the risk of population exposure to especially harmful aerosols. This work includes creating a course on air pollution for freshman students, and using the investigator's laboratory instrumentation for training graduate and undergraduate students, providing hands-on training for high school science teachers, and presenting educational seminars to the general public.

Nanomachines are artificial or biological nano-scale devices that perform simple computation, sensing, or actuation. Molecular communication provides a mechanism for nanomachines to communicate over a short distance (adjacent nanomachines to tens of micrometers) using molecules as a communication carrier.<br/><br/>The class of molecular communication systems that the PI considers in the project consists of sender nanomachines, receiver nanomachines, carrier molecules, and the environment that these operate in. Senders and receivers include biological (such as cells or bacteria) and biologically derived (such as molecular motors or sensors taken from biological systems) nanomachines that are capable of emitting and capturing molecules. Carrier molecules are proteins, ions, or DNA. The environment is the aqueous solution that is typically found within and between cells.<br/><br/>In the project, the P.I. develops research ideas for molecular communication, designs a few possible molecular communication systems, evaluates the feasibility through simulations, empirical studies, collaborates with researchers in the field to identify promising options, and develops a full proposal to submit to NSF for the next year's competition.<br/><br/>Intellectual merits and broader impacts of the proposed projects are the following:<br/>Creation of new research area: Researchers have so far focused on understanding biological nanomachines and artificially creating counterparts of biological nanomachines. In this project, the P.I. investigates molecular communication as a solution for nano-scale communication between nanomachines. Using molecules as communication carriers is new, and creating such paradigm shifting research is intellectually challenging and rewarding.<br/>Interdisciplinary research: The project is interdisciplinary and involves biotechnology, nano technology and information technology. This is intellectually challenging and rewarding.<br/>Creation of new applications for bio and nano technologies: Communicating nanomachines enables a new set of applications. If multiple nanomachines communicate, they may cooperate and perform complex tasks such as nano-scale sensing, molecular computing, or nanomedicine. The proposed research enables creation of such important applications, and its impact is broad.<br/>Creation of new courses at the graduate program level: The project produces a broad impact on education by identifying a new area of science and technology. The proposed research leads to the creation of new courses of the multidisciplinary nature at a graduate program level that provides a broad scope of nano scale science.

Efforts to understand how these pests recognize and interact with their hosts have been hampered by their parasitic life cycle and small size. The goal of the proposed research is to produce an integrated genetic map of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla. This species was selected because its unusual reproductive mode makes it possible to carry out genetic crosses and to produce large numbers of genetically uniform lines. Nematode strains that differ in attraction to specific plant species and in ability to reproduce on common bean carrying a resistance gene have already been characterized. The segregation of these traits as well as other traits affecting the nematode's ability to infect specific plants and DNA markers will be determined by examination of progeny from genetic crosses. This analysis will be coordinated with a project to sequence the M. hapla genome and will lead to the identification of genes that modulate how a nematode is attracted to and causes disease on specific crop plants. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Understanding the biology of these organisms is essential for the development of safer control measures. While the current research will focus on genes involved in host range, it will also establish a basis for other investigations of this complex parasitic interaction as well as for comparison of genome structure among nematode species. Insight into the novel genetic system of M. hapla is likely to stimulate general interest by evolutionary biologists and geneticists working on other organisms. The research will provide a rich source of projects for training students in genetic research approaches, and students at levels from high school to post graduate will participate in the proposed experiments.

A cross-disciplinary team has been<br/>assembled to carry out this work. Automated logical deduction will be used to achieve semantic integration of multiple heterogeneous biological data sources and to answer queries that involve combination of data from diverse data sources. An axiomatic biological theory will be developed with the ability to 1) Express fundamental biological concepts and relationships<br/>2) Represent metadata describing the capabilities of diverse data sources, 3) Understand the meaning of complex queries, 4)Decompose queries into simpler components to be answered by available sources and 5)Assemble answers by combining results from multiple component queries. While queries can be posed in English or conveyed via a graphical user interface, ultimately they are rephrased as conjectures, that is, theorems to be proven in the formal biological theory. The theorem is proven by an automatic theorem prover, and an answer to the query is extracted automatically from the proof. The project includes the development of a formal biological language and theory, the development of techniques to automate the formation of procedural attachments (software to access the data sources), and the discovery of domain-specific strategies to accelerate the theorem-proving process. BioLogica will demonstrate that the application of spatial and temporal inference and more general reasoning applied to a domain-specific formal theory provides an effective approach to the semantic integration of scientific data sources.<br/><br/>The formal knowledge base and prototype tool will be made available on the Web, and annual<br/>workshops will be held to acquaint the broader community with use of the tool and to exchange<br/>ideas about improving the underlying technology. A variety of planned student projects will<br/>train students in techniques for integration of diverse biological data sources and in development<br/>of bioinformatics tools. We will work with interested faculty to incorporate use of the tool into<br/>courses. Among the social impacts are developing a software assistant that enables research biologists to deal with the bewildering multiplicity of available online data and making such data available to instructors and students. The natural-language component of the proposed prototype is capable of spoken, as well as typed, interaction. Thus BioLogica could be adapted for use by researchers and students with visual or other impairments. It is expected that the techniques introduced by BioLogica for the biological sciences will more generally be applicable to semantic integration of data sources in all the sciences.

Since the gas is very tenuous and spatially extended, changes in the metallicity, temperature, kinematics and ionization state of the IGM can persist for long periods. Observations of the absorption caused by the IGM in the spectra of background quasars reveal the often-subtle signatures of the various astrophysical processes that cause such disturbances. This project will study the general structure of the gaseous cosmic web at high redshift, with particular emphasis on the interactions between galaxies and the IGM. High-quality, high-resolution observations of absorption systems will be used to search for the kinematic signature of interstellar and intergalactic winds, while data from closely spaced quasar lines of sight will be used to measure the small scale density field and to determine the turbulent energy and bulk motions. A large part of the effort will be aimed at taking an image of the general distribution of neutral hydrogen at high redshift by seeing the glow from the IGM.<br/><br/>The project includes multi-level educational and practical experiences for students, with particular emphasis on undergraduates from colleges in the Los Angeles area. Students will get first-hand experience of a working professional observatory, including observing trips with staff members to South America, and will be expected to complete a self-contained project.

The rapid replication and prototyping provided by this technique will enable the study of devices and structures that would otherwise be difficult or prohibitively expensive to make. NIL involves 1) the physical templating of topographic or chemical structures and 2) subsequent photo- or thermal-initiated materials synthesis. The full implementation of this laboratory requires the purchase of two instruments for which we are requesting funding: a Step-and-Flash NIL instrument from Molecular Imprints, Inc. and a state-of-the-art plasma etching system from Trion, Inc. This laboratory is critical to the success of multiple research activities involving the co-PIs and other members of the NSF MRSEC at UMass including the development of advanced materials for nanostructured devices (e.g. nanoscale patterned surfaces for sensors, single-step processing of ultra-low dielectric constant patterns, and high power density pulsed power capacitors for electric vehicles) and fundamental research into the challenges that are limiting the implementation of NIL on the manufacturing scale. The instruments will be housed in the open access Keck Nanostructures Laboratory and a comprehensive management plan is in place to ensure maintenance and accessibility to a broad user base. Additionally, the NIL Laboratory will be incorporated into existing courses on nanotechnology, and its open-access management plan will encourage use by participants in our REU and RET programs as well as faculty and students in the local five college community that includes two women's colleges: Mt. Holyoke College and Smith College. UMass Amherst is an established leader in nanoscale materials science, and this facility will further secure our leadership in device-level implementation of our discoveries while preparing students with expertise in real-world nano-scale manufacturing.<br/><br/><br/>This award at the University of Massachusetts Amherst will allow researchers on campus, as well as researchers in the local community and beyond, to advance and expand their expertise in materials research at sizes smaller than one-billionth of a meter. This grant will fund the purchase of two advanced technology instruments that together will enable the preparation of materials with user-defined patterns that are 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. This capability will aid in the development of new technologies such as chemical sensors, faster and more stable computer chips, and power management devices for electric vehicles. This facility will be an open-access center for faculty and students at UMass and in the local college community which includes two women's colleges: Mt. Holyoke College and Smith College. A comprehensive management plan will ensure accessibility, maintenance, and the incorporation of these instruments into materials research courses, while encouraging non-traditional researchers involved in the Research Experience for Undergraduates and Research Experience for Teachers outreach programs to use the laboratory. UMass currently has a number of exciting initiatives in nanotechnology, and the establishment of this Laboratory will ensure that we remain at the forefront of cutting edge research.

The IWOTA conferences offer a rich program on a wide range of the latest developments in operator theory and its applications. In a combination of plenary lectures by eminent mathematicians and parallel sessions of invited and contributed talks, the plan is for this year's conference (to be held July 24-27, 2005 on the campus of the University of Connecticut in Storrs (CT) is to cover a wide range of topics, including operator/system theory, operator/scattering theory, operator theory/structured matrices, operator theory/numerical analysis, operator theory/wavelets and signal processing, operator theory/harmonic analysis as well as topics in Krein space operator theory and core engineering. These topics form a core of the basic science behind a variety of applications, including control of industrial processes, tomography and image reconstruction, data compression and reconstruction, coding theory.<br/><br/>The original concept of IWOTA was as a satellite conference for operator theorists to the broader based international symposium on Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS). While this concept is still in place, the scope of IWOTA has broadened considerably in recent years and IWOTA has now attained an independent identity as a world-wide conference for recent developments in core operator theory and its applications. IWOTA's primary objective is to bring together major researchers in the area of operator theory and related fields. These meetings provide opportunities for all participants to present their own work in contributed talks, to interact with other researchers from around the globe, and to broaden their knowledge of the field by hearing the invited lectures of eminent mathematicians. In addition IWOTA emphasizes cross-disciplinary interaction among mathematicians, electrical engineers and mathematical physicists. In addition, IWOTA encourages and financially supports the participation of young researchers, i.e., advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients, for whom the opportunities offered by expert conferences are particularly important.

It will specifically focus on small molecules in organic chemistry that can be represented in various ways, such as the two-dimensional graph of covalent bonds. The project will develop new methods to explore chemical space and predict the physical, chemical, and biological properties of small organic molecules. <br/><br/>The research will directly address these problems by using annotated datasets of compounds in combination with machine learning approaches. Specifically, this project will develop new fingerprint representations of small molecules, for instance, by indexing the paths and trees contained in the molecular graphs, or by building histograms of three-dimensional distances between labeled pairs of atoms. Kernels methods - currently one of the leading methods in machine learning - will be used to measure similarity between fingerprints and to develop predictive algorithms for classification and regression tasks. The algorithms will be quantitatively evaluated in terms of their ability both to describe observed data and to predict new data. Selected applications to the prediction of critical temperatures, toxicity, mutagenicity, anti-cancer and other biological activity of small molecules will serve as testbeds for validating the techniques developed. Algorithms and data developed during the project will be made publicly available on the Web for research and scientific use. Educational activities included in this project will foster in computer science students an understanding of the increasingly important role of computer science and data mining in data-driven sciences such as chemistry. <br/><br/>New informatics methods for structured data will greatly benefit chemistry. The penetration of computational, artificial intelligence, and informatics methods in chemistry has been slower than in biology, because of the single-investigator nature of chemical research and the dominance of genome sequencing and other high-throughput projects in biology. Data on millions of compounds, however, are becoming readily available. By developing efficient fingerprints, kernels, and other machine learning methods for graphs and molecular structures, this project will address some of the most outstanding problems in the field and help accelerate the penetration of modern computational methods in chemistry. <br/><br/>The project has the potential for significant benefit to society. Small molecules have numerous applications in biology, pharmacology, and bioengineering. They can be used to probe and study biological pathways and systems and to develop new drugs. The algorithms developed by this project will provide basic building blocks and important steps towards understanding and predicting molecular properties from molecular structures. They will allow scientists to screen large data sets of compounds rapidly, while searching for compounds that satisfy particular structural or functional constraints. This will produce cost savings, accelerate the development of new drugs, and promote the understanding of chemical space.

Strategic design entails prescribing the types of sensors, the number of each type and the location of each sensor; tactical operations require detecting anomalous vessel behavior and analyzing system fault tolerance. The approach to strategic design involves formulating mathematical models, devising specialized algorithms to solve large-scale instances, and testing algorithms computationally. The approach to detecting anomalous behavior entails devising a generalized Bayesian framework and a multivariate statistical monitoring procedure to determine normal behavior using historical data to infer an intruder's intentions from position and velocity. The approach to fault tolerance analysis involves graph theory and combinatorial mathematics.<br/><br/>If successful, society will benefit from the enhanced homeland security provided by improved surveillance systems in the Houston ship channel and in ports and waterways throughout the country as well as in sensitive facilities like industrial plants, nuclear power plants, office buildings, and national monuments. The project will promote multidisciplinary teaching and training by training participating students and providing computer programs for teaching and research. It will contribute to the infrastructure for research and education by motivating students to pursue careers in relevant areas and by engaging teachers from minority-serving high schools. It will promote learning as results are taught in various universities. Participants will be actively recruited from under-represented groups to promote their socioeconomic welfare. The plan for dissemination will make results widely available, contributing to training analysts, engineers, and security authorities by presenting at professional conferences, publishing in refereed journals, and teaching at university-level courses.

The proposed payload project will be conducted in conjunction with the current NEESR project, which is under the direction of Professor Saiidi at UNR, entitled as Seismic Performance of Bridge Systems with Conventional and Innovative Design. The NEESR project makes use of<br/>the large-scale shake table systems at the NSF NEES site to develop detailed<br/>understanding of bridge seismic performance of multi-span bridge models. The testing<br/>program encompasses single and two-column bents as well as full-scale bridges.<br/>The objective for the proposed payload project is to use two different types of distributed<br/>fiber optic sensor systems for real-time health monitoring during seismic activities and<br/>for post seismic evaluation of beam column joints, abutments, and slab spans. The sensor response will be analyzed to examine the various design issues related to bridges supported on drop cap bents. The proposed distributed sensory system will be effective in development of deterministic tools for assessment of damage and verification of analysis schemes and design parameters. The serially multiplexed fiber Bragg grating<br/>sensors will be used for measurement of dynamic response and real time detection of<br/>damage. Fiber Optic Long gauge distributed sensors will be used for post seismic damage assessment and safety following of an earthquake. The bridge models currently being tested at UNR include conventional reinforced concrete columns; concrete filled fiber reinforced composite tubes as well as innovative damage reducing materials that are being used in the locations where plastic hinges develop. The post hazard evaluation aspect of the distributed sensor system will be an important aspect of the project providing a deterministic tool for assessing the health and safety of bridges following seismic events.

This project will support a Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Biochemical Aspects of Photosynthesis to be held at Bryant University, Smithfield, RI from July 3 to July 8, 2005. The Gordon Research Conferences are the key conferences in the field of photosynthesis and are attended by researchers from around the world. A principal objective of the 2005 meeting is to assemble a diverse, inter-disciplinary group of scientists who use cutting-edge technologies to attack critical problems in the field. There is an emphasis on biology including genomic approaches, biogenesis and assembly, regulation, and stress effects. Leading established researchers, new investigators as well as scientists from other fields have been invited to present lectures on their most recent, unpublished discoveries. The complete program represents an international community of scientists (www.grc.org/programs/2005/photosyn.htm).<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The meeting will integrate research and education by encouraging the participation of faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions, Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows. The exchange of information at this meeting is unusually strong. Virtually every participant, from the most junior to the most senior, brings his or her work into the arena for one-on-one discussion. Out of these interactions new collaborations and ideas for new approaches and directions arise.
0518659	Doctoral Dissertation Research:Contagion: Evidence from the Bond Market	SES	ECONOMICS	07/15/2005	01/10/2006	Jean Helwege	AZ	University of Arizona	Standard Grant	Daniel H. Newlon	06/30/2006	$12,500.00		helwege@eller.arizona.edu	888 N Euclid Ave	Tucson	AZ	857194824	5206266000	SBE	1320	9179, SMET	$0.00	Throughout the 1990s there were a number of financial crises that led to concerns about the operation and stability of financial markets (the Mexican peso collapse of 1994, the East Asian crisis of 1997, the Russian default of 1998). In all of these events, the initial shock of a country affected many other countries causing increases in volatility and co-movement of their financial asset markets. The term contagion has been used to address these events, and in particular the spread of a financial crisis. Furthermore, in recent years there were a number of domestic shocks (internet bubble, collapses of Enron, WorldCom), that were followed by a flight to quality and widening of credit spreads of the overall corporate bond market due to the desire of investors to hold safer assets. <br/><br/>A number of theories have been proposed to explain these episodes, and in general the propagation of shocks within and across markets. These are models based on pure information transmission [King and Wadhwani (1990), Collin-Dufresne, Golstein, and Helwege (2004)], correlated liquidity shocks [Kyle and Xiong (2001)], the rebalancing activity of risk averse agents [Kodres and Pritsker (2002)], industry and counterparty structures [Lang and Stulz (1992), Jarrow and Yu (2001)], as well as on the trading patterns of investors [Barberis and Shleifer (2003)]. Despite the abundance of explanations, no theory has yet emerged to dominate the field, and few papers have tried to empirically disentangle the implications of these models. Important, unobserved questions include: What is the channel of propagation of a shock during a time of crisis? Which parties are affected by these events? Why do some events have more profound effects than others? These questions are the motivation for this dissertation research. To answer them, this project examines the implications of various shocks on the U.S. Treasury and corporate bond market. Specifically, it will investigate the effects of firm-specific (Chapter 11 bankruptcies, credit rating downgrades) and market-wide shocks (stock market downturns) and will test the implications of the above models of contagion in an effort to discover the dominant channels of propagation of a shock within a market. Testing these models in a bond setting allows permits the investigator to contrast and compare all channels of contagion and, at the same time, gives another perspective as to the propagation of a shock (in contrast to the more standard examinations from the equity and international markets). Furthermore, the results from these tests can possibly provide useful insights in regards to other major issues related to the bond markets, such as the determinants of credit spread changes and the importance of liquidity. <br/><br/>This dissertation improvement award will be used to buy the FISD-NAIC bond database that is essential for the completion of this project. The Fixed Investment Securities Database (FISD) consists of issuer- and issuer- specific variables on all U.S. corporate bonds maturing in 1990 or later. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) consists of detailed information on all transactions by insurance companies from 1995 until 2002. This database is provided by the Fixed Income Research Program at the University of Houston, College of Business Administration and is the most comprehensive collection of publicly offered U.S. Corporate and Agency bond data available. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The results of this research promise to provide a better understanding of the propagation of a crisis across and within financial markets. This can be very beneficial to a number of parties in light of the crises that have occurred in recent years. Risk managers and portfolio managers can use this information in their investment and risk management decisions. For example, if liquidity is the dominant reason for the propagation of shocks then risk managers should appreciate the importance of holding liquid assets, especially at times of crises. Finally, policy regulators can benefit by using this information in their efforts to limit the spread of crises in the future.

The research is targeted at correlating microscopic structure and macroscopic behavior for fluids and their mixtures, with a particular emphasis on complex fluids.  While the research tools are theoretical ,  the focus is on making  connections with experiment and, where appropriate, simulation. An unusual opportunity afforded by this work is the ability to compare the results for the lattice and continuum models using the same theoretical approach.<br/> <br/>The behavior of complex fluids has been of high interest recently, stimulated by the increasingly sophisticated kinds of measurements accessible to scientists as well as the greatly expanded ability to simulate mixtures of dense fluids.  The research proposed here builds upon the work of the PI and her group in using the Born-Green-Yvon (BGY) integral equation technique to model lattice and continuum fluids and mixtures.  The lattice theory yields simple closed-form expressions for thermodynamic quantities.  Advantages include its accessibility to non-theorists, and the ability to test it using lattice simulation results on complex systems.  The continuum theory is capable of tackling more subtle issues involving the interplay between local structure and bulk properties.  However, numerical methods are required and simulation data on mixtures are limited.   The development of analogous lattice and continuum theories creates opportunities for determining which properties are sensitive to the imposition of a lattice constraint.  <br/><br/>The lattice studies proposed here focus on three projects:  re-deriving the BGY theory to describe films and interfaces and studying the transition to the bulk; increasing the complexity of systems studied to include ternary mixtures; and mapping the thermodynamic results of the BGY theory onto the formalism of the Flory-Huggins  chi  parameter,  the  most  widely-used characteristic  parameter  in  the  polymer  community.  This work  will  build  on  the  demonstrated ability of the lattice BGY theory to describe simple and polymeric fluids and mixtures, and will exploit recently developed strategies for extracting much information from a minimal amount of experimental data.  <br/><br/>On the  continuum side, the  BGY theory  has been used recently to study square-well fluids of up to 16-mers, and n-alkanes. These results will inform the proposed study of small branched alkanes, a project which will lead to a greater understanding of packing effects on fluid properties,  and consequently of what may be lost when the lattice  BGY theory is used. The second project focuses on square-well mixtures of short chain fluids; the components will range between  monomers and 8-mers, thereby stretching the limit of current simulation results.  This research  will  require  consideration  of  the  concentration  dependence  of  the  inter-  and intramolecular distributions: how to treat it, and under what conditions it will become important. <br/>  <br/>In  this  work  connections  between  experimental    data/analysis  and  the  theoretical    tools developed by the PI to study complex fluids will be expanded and strengthened. The outcome is that a more sophisticated combination of strategies, accessible to the materials community, will be available in solving  problems relating to understanding connections between  microscopic structure and macroscopic behavior. Local presentations by undergraduates and graduates will help  them  develop  teaching  skills.    Results  will  also  be  disseminated  through  conference presentations by the PI and her research group at national meetings, and publications.  The PI's efforts in research and teaching mentorship has resulted in an increase in the number of women <br/>in the ranks of graduate and postgraduate students and in faculty; it is expected that such effects will continue. <br/><br/>
0509072	Human Paleontology and Chronology of the Early Modern Humans from Pestera Muierii and Pestera Cioclovina, Romania	BCS	Biological Anthropology	08/01/2005	07/13/2005	Erik Trinkaus	MO	Washington University	Standard Grant	Joanna E.

However, the sample size of early modern humans securely dated to more than 28,000 years ago is small, and it has grown smaller as a result of the recent direct dating of a number of purportedly early specimens to within the past 10,000 years. In the context of this, two important samples from Romania, the isolated skull from Pestera Cioclovina and the partial skeleton(s) from Pestera Muierii become important, since they are directly radiocarbon dated to 29,000 and 30,000 years ago respectively. Since the former is minimally described and the latter undescribed, the researchers propose to provide a detailed morphological and paleobiological analysis and description of these important early modern human fossils, in the context of additional direct dating of the human remains and associated archeological and non-human paleontological remains. The research will provide a firmer chronological and archeological context for these important human remains, testing whether they are associated with Aurignacian remains from the same sites. It will also generate detailed paleontological data for their integration into the corpus of information relating to the emergence of modern humans, their dispersal in time and space and their biology. The resultant dating and paleontological analyses will provide significant data for a critical period in the emergence and dispersal of modern humans, data which can be used to evaluate ongoing scenarios concerning the chronology of modern human emergence, modern human phylogenetic origins, ongoing issues of modern human biological distinctiveness, the behavioral and subsistence nature of dispersing early modern human populations, and the background for ongoing modern human biological evolution. <br/><br/>The study of modern human emergence in the Late Pleistocene is a topic of widespread public (as well as academic) interest, as is witnessed by the global media coverage of new human paleontological discoveries and novel analyses which provide insight into the events, patterns and processes of our evolutionary history. This is evident in the recurrent global media coverage of each new discovery or revealing analysis. The proposed dating and analyses of the Cioclovina and Muierii human fossils will serve to foster this interest, which is ultimately related to concerns about our place in nature and the evolutionary roots of modern human biology and diversity. The research will also help to foster international scientific collaboration and infrastructural support in Romania, a country which is scientifically and economically still recovering from its political past, despite the efforts of many members of its scientific community. And since two of the personnel are doctoral candidates in Romania, it will contribute to their educational formation, and enhance the programs at their respective scientific institutions in Bucharest.

All organisms must balance the conflicting demands of gaining resources, finding mates, and avoiding predators. To know how to balance these demands, organisms rely on a variety of cues (visual, tactile, chemical) that provide information about how to best allocation their time and energy. In aquatic systems, many organisms use chemical cues (that are emitted when a predator consumes its prey) to gain information about predation risk. These chemicals induce prey to change their behavior and morphology so that they are less susceptible to predators; however, these defenses come at the cost of slower growth and decreased reproduction. Therefore, by choosing to devote energy to anti-predator defenses, the prey reduce their ability to gather resources and compete with other species in the community. Consequently, to understand ecological communities we must understand how species respond to the information provided by predation cues. While numerous studies have determined that chemical cues affect prey behavior and morphology, we often do not know the reason why prey react the way they do and whether or not the responses observed in laboratory experiments are representative of what happens in nature. Therefore, our research is designed to determine how prey detect and interpret the chemical cues of predators under more natural conditions. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include training undergraduate assistants, disseminating our work in top-tier journals and at international conferences, and striving to report our work in the popular press.
0515934	Specific Interactions of the Ribosome With the Nascent Peptide	MCB	Genetic Mechanisms	08/01/2005	07/02/2007	Alexander Mankin	IL	University of Illinois at Chicago	Continuing grant	Patrick P.

Such interactions, which can represent a general feature of protein synthesis, may affect translation and play a role in regulation of gene expression. However, the elements of the ribosome and properties of the nascent peptide critical for such interactions remain largely unknown. The aim of this research is to understand the molecular mechanisms of the functional interactions between the bacterial ribosome and short nascent peptides that result in the ribosome stalling on mRNA. The gene reporter system capable of detecting ribosome stalling will be used to identify a variety of peptides that prevent ribosome progression along the mRNA. The nascent peptide sequences that cause ribosome stalling will be selected and peptide characteristics critical for functional interactions with the ribosome will be determined. Genetic and biochemical analyses will be used to characterize the nascent peptide in the stalled complex and the elements of the ribosome that are involved in specific interactions with the nascent peptide and the stalling response. Involvement of other cellular factors in the ribosome stalling will be assessed. The physiological significance of the nascent peptide-dependent ribosome stalling will be investigated by examining the occurrence of the stalling peptide sequences in bacterial genomes. The broader impact of the study will include a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of protein synthesis, molecular mechanisms of inducible antibiotic resistance and may eventually lead to development of better antibiotics. The project will provide training for post doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students.

However, it is currently unknown which regions of the pan-Arctic are most vulnerable to future changes. In order to begin to address the future change to freshwater availability on a pan-arctic scale, this team will use a system of arctic typologies to enable the integration of biophysical data with socio-cultural data produced regionally, such as demographics and water values. They will use mature data sets to study the strategic transformations of the high latitude water cycle.<br/><br/>Recent studies suggest that climate change will have a significant impact on arctic hydrology. Changes in the hydrologic cycle will affect both the presence of surface water and the thermal balance in soil. While preliminary evidence suggests a changing climate will have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle in arctic regions, very little evidence is available to predict how the quantity of freshwater used by people is likely to change. Even less is understood about how hydrologic changes will affect the sustainability and culture of arctic residents.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this research is to use a wide array of existing data sets in a synthesis effort to describe the vital role of freshwater in the lives of people in the pan-Arctic, how it has changed in the recent past, and how it is likely to change in the future. The group will use a model to predict climate-induced changes in the hydrologic cycle and the resultant water stress on people at these high latitudes. Water-related stress will involve all of the key agents of change: climate change, land use/cover change, and water management by humans. They seek to address water stress in the pan-Arctic by testing hypotheses related to the 1) dominant types of hydrologic change at local, regional and continental scales, 2) the interplay between humans and hydrology over the pan-Arctic, and 3) future prognostication of the high latitude water cycle under changing climate and populations. An important component of this research is an attempt to bridge the gap between large, continental scale processes with those processes acting at local scales.

Directed by Dr. Michael Frachetti and bolstered by a team of scientists from Canada, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the USA, the DMAP combines state-of-the-art archaeological methods such as computer mapping, simulations, and satellite image analysis with more traditional archaeological methods such as excavation, botanical studies, and biological studies, in order to understand the social organization, subsistence strategies, mobility patterns, and regional interactions that defined the unique way of life for societies living in this part of eastern Eurasia more than 4000 years ago. <br/><br/>In Eurasia, the Bronze Age (c. 2500-1000 BCE) is considered to be a time in prehistory when a number of major technological, linguistic, and cultural innovations changed the way societies of Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Near East interacted. Among these innovations are: 1) the proliferation of horse riding and chariot technology; 2) the spread of Indo-European languages; and 3) the widespread dispersal of metallurgy and ceramics across the Eurasian steppe. All of these innovations are understood in association with mobile pastoral societies who occupied Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BC, and are framed in terms of their economic and cultural relationships across the steppe. Yet unfortunately, these conditions are still under-documented by scientific archaeology in the steppe region, thereby limiting ability to discuss the political economy and cultural character of this key region in greater detail. <br/><br/>In response to the lacuna of data from this region, the current project aims to provide a focused and analytically rigorous reconstruction of prehistoric pastoral adaptations, in order to understand how Bronze Age populations exploited their local environments, the degree to which their various economic, social, and political strategies generated inter-regional contacts, and how specific forms of interaction played a role in generating a wider scale cultural landscape across Eurasia throughout the 2nd millennium BCE. To answer these questions, the DMAP builds on 4 years of previous research, to carry out comprehensive archaeological excavations and sampling of Bronze Age seasonal settlements and cemeteries throughout the study zone of the Koksu Valley in Kazakhstan. These excavations will provide data for analysis of paleo-botany, archaeo-fauna, geo-morphology, and physical anthropology, as well as data for spatial analysis using Geographic Information Systems. The project's operations will also contribute essential data to debates surrounding the chronology of Bronze Age steppe societies and their material culture, as well as the emergence and evolution of pastoral nomadism as a prevalent social and economic system in the steppe region. <br/><br/>In addition to its intellectual merit, the DMAP also has broader impacts in areas such as training, education, and international scientific collaboration. The project is structured to introduce and train American graduate students in an exciting new frontier of archaeological discovery. In terms of collaboration, the DMAP contributes state-of-the-art technology and contemporary archaeological methods to a developing academic community in Kazakhstan. The proposed project joins forces with scholars and students from Kazakhstan, and contributes to the training of scientists and future archaeologists from around the world through the application of contemporary analytical methods, technology, and field techniques. The Dzhungar Mountains Archaeology Project represents one of today's most scientifically integrated studies of the evolution of Eurasian nomadic pastoralism, and strives to make a substantial impact on our broader understanding of the historical and cultural geography of Central and Inner Asia.

The unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution afforded by the development of a dynamic transmission electron microscope (DTEM) would provide an important new tool for sensing materials and molecules on the nanoscale. Such an innovative advance could, in the future, allow the direct visualization of individual atomic motions - an important step in understanding both chemical reaction kinetics (e.g., biological and industrial catalysis) and fundamental physical processes in solid-state materials (e.g., the interaction of lattice vibrations with atomic-scale defects). Even modest temporal information provided by such an instrument on individual nano-particles and structures should also enable significant improvements to be made in Nanoscale Devices and System Architecture. It is this promise of significant scientific benefit and broad impact that ameliorates the high risk of this technologically challenging exploratory research project.<br/><br/>We intend to investigate the primary key intellectual problem facing the development of a future DTEM; namely, the generation of a spatially-coherent electron pulse from an ultrashort pulse laser-driven photocathode in the presence of intrinsic decoherencing electron-electron scattering (or space-charge) effects. To meet this challenge, we propose to combine today's nanotechnology with a state-of-the-art, high-power, picosecond laser system to control the initial spatial phase of pulsed photoemission from a large-area nano-patterned (e.g., quantum dot array) photocathode. The propagation dynamics (i.e., partial spatial coherence and temporal pulse broadening) of the electron pulse from the prototype ultrafast test-bed electron gun will be studied to determine the optimum coherent photoemission conditions.

The ability of liquid crystals to detect the adsorption of proteins or viruses at surfaces or interfaces has been exploited for development of highly effective and inexpensive biological sensors. The principle of operation for these sensors is an anchoring transition of the liquid crystal material at a surface, triggered by the binding of a biological molecule or organism to a substrate. This transition leads to formation of defects, which propagate over macroscopic length scales. This cascade of defects provides the basis for a remarkable amplification mechanism, making possible the detection of a few binding events by simple optical means.<br/><br/>While the use of liquid crystals for sensing applications has been focused on solid surfaces, recent studies suggest that liquid-liquid interfaces could also be used for sensing, thereby paving the way for development of more versatile sensing devices, and development of novel technologies capable of interrogating the structure of interfaces with nanometer level resolution. For such devices and technologies to be quantitative (as opposed to purely qualitative), it will be necessary to develop a theoretical formalism capable of providing a direct correspondence between macroscopic experimental measurements (e.g. optical micrographs) and anchoring transitions and specific binding events occurring at the scale of nanometers. That formalism is inherently multi-scale, in that it must be capable of capturing anchoring transitions occurring at the level of a few liquid crystal molecules while being able to describe the formation of defects over micrometer length scales. <br/><br/>A hierarchical, multi-scale modeling approach is proposed for description of liquid-crystal based chemical and biological sensors. A diverse and unique team of scientists and engineers from the US and the EC has been assembled, all of them with complementary backgrounds and expertise. A carefully orchestrated set of modeling activities is proposed which capitalizes on the strengths of individuals and exploits synergisms between the groups of M.Olvera, J.de Pablo, I.Szleifer, M.Laso, H.Ottinger, and D.Theodorou. <br/><br/>The proposed hierarchical multi-scale approach starts from atomistic models of water, surfactant and peptide amphiphile laden interfaces, and liquid crystals. Residue-level models are used for biological molecules. These models will be coarse grained, using recently proposed methods from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The resulting coarse grain models will be fed into single-molecule and field theories to <br/>map out the structure and phase behavior of the systems of interest over wide ranges of parameter space. The theories will be used to predict the formation of nanostructured patterns at interfaces, which can subsequently be exploited to bind specific proteins and even growth factors for cell capture. The theories will also be used to provide potentials of mean force and other relevant structural information, which will <br/>be fed into field-theoretic and lattice Boltzmann descriptions of defect dynamics in liquid crystals, over macroscopic length scales both at and beyond equilibrium. Solution of these dynamic models will be implemented within the context of novel, grid-less numerical techniques. A final, global effort will consider solution of the entire multi-scale system within a micro-macro formalism that will simultaneously resolve the dynamics of molecules in effective fields and the macroscopic conservation equations.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The sensor systems envisaged in this proposal are particularly complex. They include multiple species, small and large molecules, charges, interfaces, and are often encountered in far from equilibrium situations. They exhibit a rich structural, phase and dynamical behavior that spans many length and time scales. Given this complexity, past theoretical and numerical studies have been largely <br/>limited to select, isolated elements or components of the systems considered in this proposal. There are few, if any precedents for describing the adsorption of biological molecules to peptide amphiphile and surfactant laden interfaces at a molecular level, and for describing the concomitant response of a coexisting liquid crystalline material to that adsorption process over nanoscopic and mesoscopic length <br/>scales, with full consideration of hydrodynamic effects. This proposal describes a multi-pronged, concerted plan of research that brings some of the best, state-of-the-art theory and simulation to the study of such processes. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Sensor design has become an area of central importance to science and technology. The biological sciences will benefit considerably from devices capable of detecting the occurrence of proteins in real time, medicine will benefit from faster, reliable sensors for minute amounts of proteins, and society in general will benefit from inexpensive and reliable sensors for chemical toxins and viral <br/>agents. Recent published reports indicate that the sensors to be explored in this proposal offer unusual promise on all of those fronts. Such reports also underline the fact that the usefulness and promise of liquid-crystal based sensing devices can only be fully realized by developing detailed multi-scale models and a fundamental understanding of the processes that occur in such systems over various length and time <br/>scales. The multi-scale formalism to be developed in this project will not only facilitate considerably the design and development of sensors, but will also permit development of quantitative, liquid-crystal based techniques to probe the structure and properties of interfaces.

This device uses sensitive MTJ devices to sense the magnetic field created by a patterned magnetized scale, and converts the resulting information into an accurate reading of angular position. The dual advantages of high-temperature operation (up to 200 degrees C) and contamination resistance will separate this device from the optical encoders that currently dominate the market for motor encoders. Current motor encoders are rarely capable of operation above 115 degrees C, a problem that requires motors in many market segments to operate in non-optimal configurations, costing end users in terms of time and efficiency. In addition, optical methods are sensitive to dust in the measurement path. <br/><br/>This development effort will create a new measurement technology with greatly enhanced capabilities for use in many critical segments of America's manufacturing sector. The creation of cost-effective encoders capable of operation at high temperatures will increase efficiency and enable further progress in a number of areas where hot environments are unavoidable, such as in the turbines of power-generating windmills. This research will advance the state of understanding of the emerging spintronic technology of magnetic tunnel junctions, a class of devices which forms the central component of a number of important commercial products in the high-tech semiconductor and data storage industries.

Strikingly, LSB galaxies appear to be dark matter dominated, making them an excellent probe of the dark matter distribution, and especially of the steep inner cusp predicted by simulations of the lambda-cold dark matter model, which is (arguably) not seen in the observations. This lack of a consensus about the cusp-core problem has created an enormous demand for more and better data, which this research will provide. The work will also address some related issues, notably extending the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation to lower mass galaxies.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to a continuing and extensive outreach program, including popular articles and lectures, activities in schools with students predominantly from under-represented communities, and support for graduate and undergraduate students, similarly emphasizing under-represented groups.

Configurable computing systems allow the same hardware to be used for various applications for distinct parallel algorithms. Hence, rather than replacing expensive system hardware, new versions of a hardware architecture can be loaded into the same configurable integrated circuit reducing the system costs. A major goal in developing this system consists in automating the process of mapping algorithms onto a configurable computer in a transparent fashion. Projects using this implementation include:<br/>-Parallel configurable digital signal processing,<br/>-Parallel algorithm development for problems in applied mathematics and the computational sciences,<br/>-Parallel implementation of 3D image reconstruction for PET scanner data,<br/>-Modeling of a configurable digital signal processing subsystem for handheld electronic nose,<br/>-Cubic spline interpolation, and<br/>-Sensor-based supply chains.<br/>Each of these applications will be mapped onto the parallel configurable computing system to perform comparisons with the best single/parallel PC implementation and to make the appropriate optimizations to execute orders of magnitude faster on this parallel configurable computer. Moreover, the infrastructure supports the following research activities:<br/>-Detection of cancerous tumors using 3-D PET image reconstruction,<br/>-Onboard processing for control of spacecraft and other science data processing required by NASA scientists and engineers,<br/>-High performance image processing,<br/>-Odor remediation and assessment, and<br/>-Sensor-based supply chains.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The work exhibits potential to bring serious savings to product tracking through their life cycle. The Auto-ID Center has estimated potential global supply savings between $150 to $300 billion a year. Through RFID deployment, Wal-Mart alone could save $8.36 Billion annually, including $600 million through avoiding stock-outs and $575 million avoiding theft. Furthermore, enabling under-represented students and faculty, this research takes place at a major HBCU with collaboration with other universities and federal agencies.

Low-frequency vibrational modes in proteins are of significance to the dynamics of a variety of biological processes, including those of the first events of vision and photosynthesis, because these modes account for the rate-limiting structural rearrangement of the reactant molecules that defines the reaction coordinate. Despite their importance, very little is concretely known about which structures are moving nor is the character of the motion involved in the normal mode of vibration understood. Recent work in the PI's laboratory suggests that intermolecular modes between electronic chromophores and the surrounding protein or solvent are good candidates for the modes that control electron-transfer reactions in proteins. Interactions like these allow a protein to tune the electronic properties and reactivity of the imbedded chromophores. These modes can be detected using a femtosecond time-domain form of resonance Raman spectroscopy called dynamic absorption spectroscopy. This project takes advantage of recent progress made in this laboratory in the detection and analysis of signals arising from low-frequency coherent wave-packet motion on the ground and excited-state potential-energy surfaces of electronic chromophores in solution and in protein hosts. An important finding from this work is that clustered solvent molecules in the first solvation shell of chromophores with delocalized pi-electron systems can be vibronically coupled to the chromophore's pi-to-pi* electronic transition; they obtain resonance Raman activity by attacking the pi-electron density of the chromophore. The initial focus of the research will be on characterization of vibrational coherence of Zn(II)-substituted porphyrins in solution and in two simple protein hosts, cytochrome c and myoglobin. The focus in these studies will be on the ordered polar and non-polar intermolecular interactions of neighboring solvent or amino acid side chains with the pi-electron density of the porphyrin.<br/><br/>The methods and ideas that will be developed in this project are potentially of broad use in the study of chemical dynamics in biological systems, materials, and in condensed phases. The use of strong electronic chromophores in time-resolved spectroscopic studies of protein and solvent dynamics is also of potential importance to the area of protein stability and folding/misfolding. This research will play an integral role in the PI's graduate and undergraduate teaching by providing key lecture topics and applications even in introductory courses. Additionally, the work will provide excellent training for research students at all levels. The work will expose the students to a wide range of disciplines, ranging from structural biology to chemical physics.

They are the<br/>intermediate evolutionary stage between high mass-loss asymptotic giant branch stars and white<br/>dwarfs. As the final stage of mass loss for low and intermediate mass stars, the nebulae represent a<br/>critical step in the mass and chemical evolution cycle for more than half the material ejected into the<br/>interstellar medium. The ubiquity of planetary nebulae and their ease of observation have also made<br/>them premier laboratories for testing new astrophysical theories. Here, a program to better<br/>understand the formation of planetary nebulae and the late stages of stellar evolution for low and<br/>intermediate mass stars will be undertaken.<br/>High resolution images of planetary nebulae and their progenitors have triggered a critical reevaluation<br/>of the dominant paradigm for nebular shaping. The new data has revealed features such<br/>as non-axisymmetric episodic jets and multi-polar outflows which can not be embraced with purely<br/>hydrodynamic theories. In addition, data from studies of proto-nebulae show energetic winds<br/>forming from cool stars that lack sufficient luminosity for radiative driving. Thus the theory of<br/>planetary nebula evolution and, by implication, our ideas about processes at work in the late stages<br/>of stellar evolution, require fundamental revision. Previous work by Frank and collaborators has<br/>established the potential efficacy of magneto-centrifugal launching processes in planetary nebulae<br/>and proto-planetary nebulae. The central source driving the outflow is either a rapidly rotating<br/>stellar core or a binary-fed accretion disk or both. In all cases the magnetic field is likely to<br/>originate via dynamo processes. The goals of the present study, which build upon this earlier work,<br/>are three fold: (1) To understand the nature of magnetic field generation in single asymptotic giant<br/>branch (pre-nebula) stars, binary systems and in accretion disks. (2) To link magneto-centrifugal<br/>process at the core (star and/or disk) to global planetary nebulae and proto-nebulae morphologies,<br/>kinematics and ionization/chemistry states. This will be achieved through the use of a new Adaptive<br/>Mesh Refinement code, AstroBEAR, built at the University of Rochester in collaboration with the<br/>University of North Carolina Applied Math Department. (3) And to provide theoretical support for<br/>an ongoing series of laboratory astrophysics experiments conducted at Imperial College in London<br/>which have generated supersonic magnetically driven bubbles. These experiments are directly<br/>relevant to these planetary nebula models.<br/>While the work here is focused on planetary nebulae it will be of direct relevance to other fields<br/>both theoretically and observationally in the sense of allowing planetary nebulae to potentially act<br/>as a test-bed for theories of magnetohydrodynamic outflows. The work with the Imperial Collage<br/>group helps to deepen the rapidly growing field of High Energy Density Laboratory Astrophysics.<br/>The development the AstroBEAR code is of particular benefit as it includes new multi-physics,<br/>multi-numerics methods and the work on it here will help train the next generation of computational<br/>astrophysicists. Finally, an innovative outreach program is included which involves the creation of<br/>Sci-Interactives: simulation based learning modules which will be posted on popular science<br/>magazine websites.

0514966	Collaborative Research: A New Theoretical and Algorithmic Framework for RTL Datapath Verification using Polynomial Algebra over Finite Integer Rings	CCF	NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT	08/01/2005	07/21/2005	Priyank Kalla	UT	University of Utah	Standard Grant	Robert B Grafton	07/31/2006	$38,643.00		kalla@ece.utah.edu	75 S 2000 E	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	841128930	8015816903	CSE	2865	HPCC, 9218	$0.00	This project aims to establish an altogether new paradigm in computer design verification by synergistically integrating polynomial algebra, ring theory and algorithm development, all within a VLSI-CAD based verification framework. As digital designs proceed through various synthesis and optimization stages, it is required to verify the functional equivalence of different design implementations. However, the growing complexity of digital systems is limiting the scope and applications of contemporary verification tools. This has particularly affected efficient verification of polynomial signal processing and multimedia applications where arithmetic datapath computations are implemented at register-transfer-level (RTL). For such designs, the verification problem can be modeled as that of proving polynomial equivalence over finite integer rings of the form Z_{2^k}, where k is the size of the datapath operands. In this project properties of these integer rings are being thoroughly investigated, and used to investigate algorithms for verification of digital circuits modeled at the register-transfer-level.<br/><br/>In this collaborative research, the PIs will: (1) study and derive new mathematical techniques to verify equivalence of multi-variate polynomials over finite rings of the form Z_{2^k}; (2) derive algorithmic procedures to prove polynomial equivalence in Z_{2^k}, within a CAD-based RTL verification framework; and (3) explore the above concepts in the context of efficient RTL synthesis of polynomial datapaths. The novelty of the problem lies in its mathematical challenge and in its engineering applications to RTL datapath verification. Successful completion of this project would broadly impact RTL datapath verification technology and enhance the understanding of some of the unresolved problems in classical mathematics.

Understanding the<br/>distribution and properties of these stars is important for understanding Galactic chemical evolution,<br/>as well as for constraining the dynamics of supernova explosions and for illuminating the formation<br/>and life-cycles of various type of exotic compact binary systems.<br/>The most direct constraints on the neutron star distribution come from measurements of parallaxes<br/>and proper motions. In most cases, these measurements can be made only for the subclass of<br/>neutron stars that are luminous at radio wavelengths: the radio pulsars. Even then, the closest radio<br/>pulsars are a hundred times the distance of the closest stars, and the effects of parallax and proper<br/>motion are correspondingly smaller. Only about 1% of pulsars have measured parallaxes and only<br/>about 10% of pulsars have even crudely measured proper motions.<br/>Here, Thorsett and Dewey will continue their highly successful interferometry program, using the<br/>Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array to make very precise astrometric<br/>measurements of a large sample of pulsars and address several important questions. The<br/>investigation will, over the next three years, measure the birth velocity distribution of neutron stars<br/>with sufficient accuracy to constrain both the high and low velocity tails (needed to understand<br/>supernova asymmetries and retention of neutron stars in globular clusters, respectively), and will<br/>improve understanding of local pulsar distances and the local pulsar birthrate. This plan is based<br/>primarily on observations that are either underway or already approved.<br/>The investigations will include student training and support, with project data forming the basis of a<br/>Ph.D. thesis. The student and the principle investigators will also maintain formal connections and<br/>participate in activities with the Exploratorium science museum and the COSMOS summer<br/>program. Co-investigator Dewey is also Education and Public Outreach Director for the UCSC<br/>branch of Calspace, providing further outreach opportunities.<br/>External science investigations will also be enabled by both web and traditional publication of the<br/>data gathered here. These include identification of the primary target lists for The Gamma-ray Large<br/>Area Space Telescope and other satellite missions, and interpretation of multiwavelength pulsar<br/>emission data. Comparison of the local pulsar birthrate to the massive star birthrate, constrains the<br/>properties of the progenitors of Type II supernovae. Pulsar velocity measurements not only<br/>constrain models of their birth events, and are important input parameters to population synthesis<br/>studies of binary systems. The observations made to identify calibration sources for the Very Long<br/>Baseline Array surveys comprise a large survey sample of 21-cm snapshots of extragalactic sources.

GERSHENSON,<br/>INSTUTUTION: RUTGERS UNIVERSITY. NJ<br/><br/>The recent discovery of several powerful quantum algorithms indicates that a quantum-mechanical computer might have an enormous advantage over its conventional classical counterpart in solving many difficult problems. However, for successful implementation of quantum computing, the quantum computer elements (a.k.a. qubits) should be sufficiently decoupled (protected) from the environment. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop the first scalable element for quantum computation that would be sufficiently protection from environmental noise. The proposed approach to the solid-state realization of a die-hard Schrodinger cat is based on nanoscale Josephson junctions protected by nontrivial symmetries. Development of a fabrication-friendly design of protected superconducting qubits and fabrication of this novel nanodevice will be crucial for successful realization of quantum computation. The proposed experiments will provide a testing ground for the physical realization of ideas of symmetry-based protection developed in string theory, with the aim of applying them towards computer science. Implementation of the proposed research will contribute to better understanding of the decoherence processes in numerous quantum nanodevices operating at low temperatures. The multi-component Educational and Outreach Program, an essential part of the project, is designed to nurture an appreciation for nanoscience, to develop innovative curricula and training modules in nanoscience and nano-engineering, and to disseminate the curricula with a view of creating a more scientifically literate general public.

These OS bugs are often<br/>the result of memory management errors, which are very hard for<br/>developers to avoid. In the long run, a broad class of<br/>memory-management errors can be prevented by using a high-level,<br/>type-safe language, but whether these languages are suitable for<br/>kernel implementation remains an open question. Unfortunately, any<br/>given experiment to answer the question (i.e., using a particular<br/>high-level language) involves many differences in implementation<br/>compared to a conventional kernel, making it difficult to draw<br/>conclusions about which parts of the high-level approach work and<br/>which parts do not. This project is an experiment specifically about<br/>garbage collection for legacy OS kernels, changing as few other<br/>implementation issues as possible. Concretely, the research is about<br/>developing tools to automatically transform the C source code of a<br/>conventional kernel so that it is compatible with a variety of precise<br/>garbage-collection strategies. The project's ultimate goal is to check<br/>whether the OS becomes usefully more reliable as a result of garbage<br/>collection, and to measure the performance costs in both desktop and<br/>embedded environments. If the experiment shows that the OS improves at<br/>a reasonable cost, then the research will have shown how to increase<br/>the reliability of a major part of today's computer systems<br/>infrastructure. Tools generated by the project will be made publicly<br/>available for use in research, for application to practical software,<br/>and for pedagogical purposes.

Clouds and precipitation affect our daily lives, personal safety, commercial decisions, and our future sustainability on Earth. Clouds and precipitation are important at all regional scales: local, state, national, and global. For example, clouds influence the daily maximum and minimum temperatures over our homes and they modulate the global temperature by affecting the amount of incoming solar radiation and outgoing longwave radiation. As the inhabitants of earth become increasingly concerned about global warming and climate change on global and regional levels, it is necessary to understand the roles of clouds and precipitation in the Earth System in order to predict the future state of our planet.<br/><br/>However, understanding and predicting atmospheric phenomena are very difficult tasks which require the measurement and modeling of properties on a wide variety of scales (cloud scale, storm scale, mesoscale, globally), fusion of computational model data, measured data, and the simultaneous fusion of hundreds of scalar and vector fields that vary over time. Current tools for atmospheric visualization are not capable of integrating these various data sources, communicating the complex three-dimensional, time-varying information necessary to accurately understand and predict atmospheric events, or for the integration of visual representations into the scientific analysis and discovery process. <br/><br/>This project will provide a fundamental advance in visualization and interaction techniques to solve these multiscale, multifield, data fusion, analysis, time-critical decision making, and interaction problems. These new multiscale, multifield, atmospheric visualization tools will: incorporate novel, effective, photorealistic and illustrative multifield visualization techniques; fuse observational and model data; improve the understanding of cloud dynamics, cloud evolution and precipitation formation; create effective multiscale visual representations; be rapidly deployed for research, training, and education; and produce an environment for actionable, comprehensive and efficient visual analysis. <br/><br/>Both computer science and atmospheric science research challenges addressed in this project will benefit other fields by: <br/><br/>1. Improving understanding of cumulus entrainment and warm rain formation, leading to better parameterizations in weather forecasting models and possibly global climate models.<br/>2. Improving training of students and atmospheric scientists to perform their science in three dimensional environments.<br/>3. Unifying access to co-registered model and measured data across multiple scales, greatly improving the understanding of the atmosphere, and advancing atmospheric models and weather prediction.<br/>4. Creating a fused, comparative visual analysis environment to reduce the ambiguity inherent in the use of a variety of data sources by calibrating multiple, measured and simulation data sources.<br/>5. Creating a physically plausible, parameterized database of canonical cloud models for use in atmospheric science research, rendering research, illumination simulation and validation (e.g., headlamp visibility in various weather conditions) and in the visual effects industry.<br/>6. Developing a new architecture and visualization tools for large scale, multiscale, multifield data integration, fusion, analysis, and experimentation for use by the larger atmospheric science community.<br/>7. Developing modules for educating high school and undergraduate students about the principles of cloud and precipitation formation. <br/><br/>The techniques to be developed will significantly change the state-of-the-art of visualization and large-scale data analysis, and have a dramatic impact on many fields using multifield, multiscale data, including computational fluid dynamics, biology, medicine, astrophysics, and nanoscale-microscale integration. Advanced information communication through advanced visual analysis tools will increase the rate of scientific discovery by improving the effectiveness of scientists and forecasters.

The workshop provides a timely forum for researchers to examine the complex scientific and technological issues that pertain to the use of advanced high-k materials in next generation semiconductor devices. A unique feature of the workshop is a special focus on defects in these materials. Intellectual merit: Conventional SiO2/Si-based MOSFET's are approaching the fundamental limit of scaling. Below 1 nm in gate dielectric thickness, leakage currents degrade dielectric performance and reliability, preventing practical use for conventional SiO2. It is thought that a feasible solution to the gate oxide scaling problem may be to replace SiO2 with novel high permittivity (high-k) gate dielectric materials. Despite significant progress achieved in this area of research, high-k materials are still satisfactory in the gate stack. The key obstacles to high-k integration into Si nano-technology appear to be electronic defects. However, little is known about the atomic scale nature of the defects or about possible techniques to eliminate, or to minimize them. <br/>Non-technical. <br/>The requested funds will be used to support students, women, minorities and young scientists to attend the Workshop. Participating in the conference is expected to increase their knowledge of the field and help them bring back to the U.S. new ideas and results from leading laboratories in Europe and elsewhere in the world. It will also help these and other U.S. participants to identify priority directions for future research in the field. Conference results/papers will be published as a book by Springer-Verlag by the end of the year. The website for the workshop is: http://www.ioffe.ru/natoarw/2005/info.html .

Broadway	Milwaukee	WI	532023109	4142777300	ENG	1189	1057, CVIS	$0.00	ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The objective of this major research instrumentation grant is to acquire a multimode scanning probe microscope, critical for the success of to an ongoing research at Milwaukee School of Engineering. The importance of the proposed equipment stems from the unique opportunities it offers to analyze materials at the mesoscale and submicron scale. The specific capabilities of the microscope will be used to achieve the following research objectives:<br/><br/>Perform chemical modification experiments at the submicron level to analyze friction and<br/>improve wear behavior of metal matrix composite (MMC) materials currently employed<br/>in Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF)-based processes.<br/><br/>Gain and improve understanding about the fatigue development and failure mechanism in<br/>rolling contact powder materials used in the manufacturing of highly loaded gears<br/><br/>The implementation of SPM in these and related research projects should result in<br/>substantial improvement of our fundamental understanding of the areas of interest. The research on MMC materials will bring deeper insight in the complex relationship between fundamental mechanical properties and microstructure parameters on one hand and wear resistance on the other. Probing the composite materials at the submicron scale using the SPM will allow us to enhance our knowledge about the fundamental interactions of chemical modifiers with the surfaces of the various phase particles and how exactly the frictional and wear properties of the particles change. Ultimately it will result in improving the wear properties of the MMC by finding appropriate modifiers and treatment conditions. In the area of rolling contact fatigue analysis crucial information for identifying and understanding the mechanisms in which failure occurs and progresses will be revealed. Based on theses results, the effects of process parameters such as material composition, heat treatment conditions and surface residual stresses will be assessed. These studies are essential for the development of materials especially suitable for rolling contact fatigue applications and manufacturing parameters.<br/><br/>The proposed major research instrumentation will substantially facilitate bringing the<br/>revolutionary ideas of nanotechnology to our current and future engineering students through laboratory experiments, undergraduate and graduate research activities. It will create challenging opportunities for students with solid foundation in engineering to participate in advanced analysis, design and fabrication research as part of MSOE's RUI and REU programs. The scanning probe microscope will become a merging point of the existing multidisciplinary research efforts at MSOE by bringing faculty with wide-ranging expertise together to solve the interdisciplinary problems of our future technologies. One of the reasons of the University's success has been its ability to establish novel programs and facilities whenever new scientific and technological developments provided opportunities. MSOE has strong ties with industry and<br/>the tradition of providing it with well educated engineers as well as technological expertise and solutions. The acquisition of the SPM and the research that it facilitates will clearly contribute to further success in this direction.

The approach is to integrate a team that has skills in synthetic chemistry, characterization, theory, computer simulation and engineering skills who can rapidly respond to recent discoveries made by the team which suggests unusual thermodynamics at the nanoscale.<br/><br/>The broader educational and outreach aspects of the NIRT activities are considered critical to the ultimate success of this program and will cross several disciplines: chemistry, physics and engineering. To create a truly multidisciplinary environment in which students can thrive, integration of synthetic organic/polymer chemistry (Wooley, Hawker) with physics/theory of nanosystems (Tomanek, Frischknecht), polymer science (Celina, Assink) and engineering (Mackay) will be accomplished through a variety of mechanisms: exchange of students, an annual meeting, regular teleconferences or cyber meetings and participation in national meetings. Teaching modules in nanotechnology have already been developed by members of this NIRTeam and other courses are under development in addition to our previous successful outreach activities such as talks to elementary School children by Mackay and Wooley and a trial presentation entitled, Nanotech Kids, is available on the web (www.nanoeverything.com). We propose to expand the outreach to K-12 and the general public by teaming with the Science Theatre located on the campus of Michigan State University to create stage shows for the public. Finally, this NIRTeam consists of dedicated researchers who will also make fundamental scientific discoveries and have the ability to translate this knowledge to industrial reality.

Point-referenced spatial<br/>data arises in several fields, including atmospheric science, ecology, <br/>environmental science, and epidemiology. In fact, often such data is <br/>replicated across time say through sampling at monitoring sites. In <br/>certain cases, with appropriate preliminary manipulation, the<br/>replicates may be viewed as independent. More often, the temporal <br/>dependence is retained and, discretizing time, a time series of<br/>spatial processes emerges. In either case, virtually all of the<br/>modeling for the spatial processes is specified parametrically; in fact, <br/>it is almost always a Gaussian process which is most frequently<br/>assumed to be stationary. The investigators study new classes of <br/>nonparametric spatial models to remove these assumptions. These models <br/>are applicable to either of the above replicated settings. In its <br/>simplest form, the investigators use Dirichlet processes to create <br/>random spatial processes, which are non-Gaussian, nonstationary, and <br/>have non-homogeneous variance. These processes are defined through<br/>their finite dimensional distributions, and are referred to as spatial <br/>Dirichlet processes. A spatial Dirichlet process is then convolved<br/>with a pure error process to create an illustrative spatial process<br/>with a nugget component. Such models are hierarchical and can be<br/>fitted through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In application, the <br/>investigators use spatial Dirichlet processes to introduce spatial<br/>random effects into the modeling, either directly with independent <br/>replicates or embedded within a dynamic model to handle temporal <br/>dependence. The investigators study an assortment of problems<br/>associated with the use of spatial Dirichlet processes, including<br/>their theoretical global and local properties; their use as mixing<br/>models; their use with semiparametric mixing; their implementation in <br/>dynamic models; their utilization for interpolation at given time<br/>points and for forecasting at future time points; their use with <br/>non-Gaussian first stage specifications for the data; their use in <br/>describing multivariate distributions and, as a special case, for <br/>extended regression modeling; their use in modeling spatial point <br/>process data; and their extension to richer classes of so-called <br/>generalized spatial Dirichlet processes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Point-referenced spatial data arises in application areas as diverse <br/>as environmental science, climatology, ecology, epidemiology, and<br/>real estate markets. As researchers collect more and more space and <br/>space-time data, the need for analyses to enhance their understanding <br/>of the complex processes they are sampling grows. This inspires the <br/>need for sufficiently rich models to accommodate a variety of global<br/>and local behaviors. The primary motivation for this research is to <br/>expand the catalog of space-time modeling tools available to such <br/>scientists. This research work suggests the first approach to <br/>nonparametric Bayesian spatial and spatio-temporal data analysis. <br/>Nonparametric Bayesian approaches have witnessed increased utilization <br/>in recent years as a result of their successful application to certain <br/>problems in, for example, engineering and biomedical fields.<br/>Similar success is anticipated by bringing this methodology to <br/>space-time settings. In particular, it is anticipated that, for fields <br/>such as epidemiology, environmental contamination and weather<br/>modeling, researchers will value the flexible modeling framework the <br/>work offers. And, an increase in usage of the methodology is expected <br/>as the computational techniques to fit the models are advanced.

He will work on stability proofs, convergence analysis and new designs, together. Specific research goals involve neural network ADP for output feedback and nonlinear filtering, neurocontrol with entropy and nonstandard value functionals, model-based continuous time ADP and small-time-step approximate tuning for model-free continuous time ADP.<br/>Neural networks provide a way to approximate unknown nonlinear functions, needed as part of general ADP, with greater accuracy than traditional approximators for a limited number of parameters.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The PI plans to write a textbook on ADP in engineering, which is needed very greatly at the present time. The related books currently available are either collections of papers less accessible to the average student (such as the Handbook of Learning and Approximate Dynamic Programming, IEEE Press, 2004) or textbooks which focus on methods of reinforcement learning developed for psychology or artificial intelligence, which do not scale well to large engineering tasks. The PI will also insert the new designs/algorithms into the practical applications worked on at the Automation and Robotics Research Institute (ARRI), into undergraduate courses, and into his program for high school students in Hands-On Design and Learning for Intelligent Control Systems.

Until recently, individual labs have simply imposed local homogeneity of format and procedure, and not stored lab-dependent metadata. This ad hoc system is limited, however, as crystallographers begin to cross between labs to accomplish their research objectives, and as increasing numbers and sizes of output data streams leave less time for each investigation. Local workflow must be made explicit, procedures must be formally described, and the history and assemblages of data expressed in an open, shareable way. Creation and management of complete, accessible records for each experiment is critical, as well as heterogeneity in data acquisition and management across the field. <br/><br/>To meet that need, this project will develop a framework of web service interfaces and data and metadata systems addressing the whole spectrum of crystallography. Project participants and collaborators will leverage existing projects, such as Reciprocal Net and Common Instrument Middleware Architecture, that address narrower issues in the problem domain. The CGF will also draw on collaborating projects with overlapping areas of interest, such as the UK-based Comb-e-Chem project. The resulting framework will be a useful environment for crystallographic investigations and an extensible platform on which new web-based applications can be built.<br/><br/>The CGF project involves the classic problem of dealing with heterogeneity in data, procedures, and instruments in the crystallography application space, and another classic problem in integrating the entire data collection, transport, and curation requirements of the domain into a seamless beginning to end system. The challenge is to create a virtualization system that manages heterogeneity in more than a single aspect and to provide vertical integration using only open, extensible, and interoperable standards and methodologies.<br/><br/>While the project constitutes research into pertinent computer science problems, the plan for performing the research is centered on producing a product (the CGF) that will immediately be useful in addressing emerging technical problems in the field of X-ray crystallography. Within crystallography, one of the specific goals is to make structural results accessible that might otherwise never be seen, and so the CGF will help increase the body of scientific knowledge and improve the return on federal investment in the large numbers of x-ray diffractometers and associated instruments nationwide. Although the project targets specifically a few hundreds of crystallography labs worldwide, the software and methods created in it are intended to be reusable for any science moving from individual lab practices to a shared, global collaboratory system. In sciences such as high-energy physics and astronomy, the scientists have long shared single, unique, large instruments and had to create shared data management and instrument metadata. CGF is likely to be useful in other scientific disciplines which still use widely-distributed lab-based instruments that now need to be linked in data grids.

The hybrid system is fabricated from MEMS devices and non-pathogenic, genetically engineered flagellar motors. The operational principle is based on detecting the rotational characteristics of the flagellar filament in the presence of TNT. The detection system is expected to have superior sensitivity, very short response time, and is compact, portable, and highly scalable. Based on preliminary calculations and studies, the system is at least 100 times lighter and would be much cheaper than commercially available TNT detection systems of similar sensitivity levels.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The detection system will be fabricated based on the core flagellar motor assembly technologies developed by the PIs' research groups. These technologies will be further advanced by completing the three complementary objectives identified for the proposed project: 1) Develop methodologies for tethering cell body to substrate surfaces, 2) Develop biological protocols for specific bead attachment, 3) Integrate detection system and evaluate performance.

No where is this perhaps more true than in bridging the disciplines of geomorphology and ecosystems ecology, despite the fundamental role that geomorphology plays in ecosystem processes. Many geomorphic (i.e., physical) processes occur parallel with ecosystem processes at similar spatial and temporal scales, thus making the two systems mutually dependent. Predicting future states of the Earth's ecosystems, and developing effective management and restoration practices, thus necessitates developing a coupled understanding of how these two aspects of the environment influence each other, and how their processes feedback into each other. The Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium (BGS 2005) will focus around the theme of Geomorphology and Ecosystems and will produce an interdisciplinary environment in which participants will review, synthesize and discuss the conceptual paradigms, field evidence and simulation models at the intersection between geomorphology and ecosystems ecology. BGS 2005 will emphasize the coupling of landscape processes/forms with ecosystem/ecological processes, as well as implications of geomorphology-ecosystem interactions in space and time for environmental management and restoration. There are three primary impacts that this conference will have. First, it will fundamentally improve general understanding of the Earth's ecosystems, and how these ecosystems can effectively protected, managed and potentially restored. Thus, the results from this conference will be of fundamental importance to the disciplines and society in general. Second, this conference will provide a venue for show-casing the research of many internationally acclaimed scholars and practitioners from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, particularly the research of female and junior geomorphologists and ecologists. Finally, this conference will show-case the contributions made by geographers working in the human-environment tradition to environmental science in general, particularly within the discipline of geomorphology. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary conference with focus on Geomorphology and Ecosystems allows experts and young scientists to explore the linkage between landscape development and ecosystems. Both are dynamic systems that are interdependent. Therefore the understanding of the fundamental concepts and behavior of such systems is crucial in effective managing the extreme events caused by the linked dynamics of geomorphic and ecological systems. Society needs the knowledge and ability to deal with, for example, soil erosion, algae blooms, floods, invasive species, wildfires, or landslides. The meeting creates a platform to exchange ideas and learn about the latest research in this emerging interdisciplinary field.

Thus, understanding the evolution of microstructures in solids is a fundamental problem in materials science. Simulations in the presence of numerous evolving interfaces pose mathematical and computational challenges, especially in three dimensions. This interdisciplinary research and training program focuses on developing mathematical models and computational techniques to overcome the challenges of computationally studying surface defects in solids and coarsening in solid-solid and solid-liquid systems. The mathematical impacts of the study will include accurate and fast numerical methods for microstructural evolution in three dimensions and for evolution of defects on solid surfaces, using boundary integral methods and incorporating both diffusional and elastic effects. These techniques will be applied to (1) investigate coarsening in solid-solid and solid-liquid systems by performing two- and three-dimensional simulations, and (2) examine step flows (motion of atomic-height steps) on solid surfaces in three dimensions. These investigations will provide insights into materials issues encountered in high-temperature alloys and semiconductor thin film growth. Close collaborations with experimentalists will allow comparisons of the simulation and experimental results. The equations governing the proposed material systems are closely related to a host of mathematical descriptions for pattern formation in moving boundary problems. Therefore, the proposed modeling and computational techniques will have broad applications and will provide new tools for other research areas. Importantly, the proposed program will provide excellent training opportunities for graduate students interested in research at the interface of mathematics, computation, and engineering.

Protein engineering is a potentially powerful method for designing functional proteins such as enzymes, biosensors, and binding proteins, and for improving the properties of natural proteins for industrial  applications. As a demonstration of a practical application, natural proteins containing disulfide bonds will be redesigned to remove the disulfide bonds. This may permit the production of these industrially important proteins with inexpensive bacterial expression systems. Computer-assisted protein design is a powerful method for testing our understanding of the underlying physical principles that dictate protein folding and function. <br/><br/>Computer-assisted protein design also has much potential for practical applications. For example, proteins can be engineered to be specific and sensitive sensors for molecules such as toxins. Many chemical syntheses require heating  reactants to high temperatures and/or the use of environmentally damaging solvents and catalysts, and often result in significant side-products. Artificial enzymes could reduce the energy and toxic waste used and produced by industrial chemical synthesis, and may also increase the overall yield of desired enantiomerically specific products.  There is much excitement and promise for the nascent field of nanotechnology. Proteins are the original nanotechnology. Their ability to adopt specific complex shapes is unmatched by any other class of compound, natural or artificial. Students will learn how to write computer programs, develop optimization algorithms, and model the basic physics of the factors involved in protein folding and binding. They will also learn a variety of experimental techniques such as gene cloning, protein expression and purification, biophysical chemical characterization of protein stabilities and binding affinities, and macromolecular structure determination. The mix of both experimental and theoretical work required for this  project  will offer a unique educational experience. <br/>

A key topic is the development and analysis of new mathematical models for illiquid financial markets which account for the dependence between asset price dynamics and trading strategies, leading to new applications for the nonlinear stochastic integration theory developed by Kunita and Carmona/Nualart in the 1990s. Furthermore, we will develop new analytic and numerical methods to both one- and two-sided singular control problems, building on their relation to certain representations of stochastic processes.<br/><br/>The vast majority of models presently studied in Mathematical Finance specify asset price dynamics as an exogenously given process, which evolves independently from the trading strategies employed by the market participants. While this idealization is appropriate for liquid markets (trading, for instance, treasury bonds or blue chips), it is largely open at present how to assess the liquidity risk in markets where asset prices are directly related to the demand generated by traders. The development and analysis of mathematical models capturing this nonlinear feedback affect between prices and trading strategies poses a challenge for stochastic optimization and control that is addressed by this project.

Decomposition is the primary process through which nutrients taken up by plants are recycled in the ecosystem. Although the physical environmental controls on decomposition have been well studied, relatively little is known about interactions among the animals that feed on detritus or how such interactions affect decomposition. Large detritivores, such as earthworms, millipedes and sow bugs, may improve the quality of food available for small soil animals such as nematodes and springtails. This project examines the interaction between a common sow bug, Porcellio scaber, and soil fauna. Porcellio scaber dramatically increases the breakdown of plant litter in this study system. The sow bugs may accelerate incorporation of plant litter into the soil, and benefit soil animals that depend on such influxes of detritus. Sow bug feeding may also benefit soil detritivores by improving the nutrient content of detritus and facilitating of microbe colonization. This work will test these hypotheses with field and laboratory experiments and demonstrate the overall impact of Porcellio scaber on soil fauna in a natural soil community and in controlled laboratory experiments. This study will contribute to a greater understanding of how carbon is cycled through decomposer foodwebs, and how species interactions contribute to variation in decomposition rates. This project will also support the dissertation research of a doctoral student.

The purpose is to determine the distribution and kinematics (deformational style) of late Paleozoic deformation across Nevada. The conventional understanding of the evolution of western North America recognizes only two orogenic (mountain-building) events during Paleozoic time. However, this team of investigators has found unequivocal evidence for previously-unrecognized Mississippian, Pennsylvanian and Permian contractional deformation events in the Pinon Range and Adobe Range, Nevada. Their work, along with published mapping by numerous other workers, indicates that these events may be widespread. This broad geographic extent and temporal persistence of contraction between the previously recognized orogenies raises some fundamental questions regarding the tectonic processes acting on western North America in Late Paleozoic time. This project is extending the investigation north to the Idaho border, and south into eastern California. This study has the potential to revise current thinking about unifying tectonic models for the Paleozoic evolution of western North America. It will, unequivocally, result in a better understanding of the extent, geometry, kinematics and timing of Late Paleozoic deformation in Nevada. It may also result in a reinterpretation of when and why contractional deformation occurred in the western part of the continent.<br/><br/>The results of this study will be of use to the mining and energy industries, because of the importance of these rocks and structures to producing and trapping hydrocarbons and to hosting gold deposits in Nevada. They may also relate to groundwater supplies for the ever-growing population of Nevada, because the structures may disrupt or displace aquifers. Research results from these workers are already being used to build more accurate hydrologic models locally in southern Nevada.

This Solid State Chemistry program (DMR) award to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University is to develop understanding the mechanism and fundamental dipole-dipole dynamic interactions (i.e., unpaired electron spin density inside/outside the carbon cage with water) responsible for the enhanced relaxivity in functionalized endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) when used as medical diagnostic agents and other imaging applications (e.g., polymers, composites). Endohedral metallofullerenes, because of their shape, and capacity for multiple endo encapsulants and exo functionalizability, are ideal nano-constructs on which to develop imaging agents. In addition, the high stability of the carbon cage is known to exhibit unusual resistance to any chemical cage-opening process. The ability to detect and measure low amplitude signals in noisy, complex environments is a fundamental challenge in imaging applications. Although there have been major improvements in biological imaging technology (MRI), the sensitivity and specificity of current techniques using contrast agents such as the one using small molecular chelates of gadolinium remain far from optimal. Although signal amplification is important to achieving this goal, it will not be sufficient; rather it will require a synergistic approach that incorporates multiple visibilities simultaneously into the same nano-construct (multi-modal), not only to increase sensitivity, but also the signal/noise ratio and provide the ability to generate quantitative data. Major goals of this award will be to: 1) provide a new model for understanding the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) (or increasing relaxivity r1= 1/ T1) of water or tissue, 2) employ this model to optimize these nanoscale interactions, and 3) develop a new multi-modality nanosphere-based endohedral metallofullerene imaging agents. In addition to the Solid-State Chemistry program (MPS), the following programs are co-funding this award: Chemistry (MPS); Engineering Education and Centers (ENG); and Bioengineering and Environmental Systems (ENG).<br/><br/>With this award, new educational programs will be developed at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels, especially in the sciences through Institute for Connecting Science Research to the Classroom (ICSRC), an interdisciplinary center established in the College of Human Resources and Education at the University. In addition, the existing short courses and hands-on laboratory experiments in nanomaterials will be expanded to include other students and faculty at Virginia Tech, Virginia Commonwealth University as well as other academic institutions across the region. These interactions would provide undergraduates and graduate students in other disciplines the opportunity to interact with each other in many areas of nanotechnology. Industrial collaborations with Luna Innovations are expected to produce nanomaterials with potential biomedical imaging applications.

The objective of this NER research is to develop biomimetic materials synthesis strategies to produce nanophase calcite structures.  In particular, calcite nanorods and nanotubes will be synthesized and their structural, mechanical, and optical properties evaluated. The approach is to use a combination of spatial confinement and chemical templating techniques to synthesize calcite nanorods and nanotubes.  These two strategies combine molecular scale structural control with nanometer/micron scale morphological control. Polycarbonate track-etched (PCTE) templates consisting of nanometer scale pores will be used to nucleate and grow calcite nanorods.  Nanorods of differing size and crystal structure will be synthesized through tuning of the pore diameter and surface treatment of the template.  Overall nanorod morphology and crystal structure will be analyzed with combined AFM/SEM, TEM, and optical microscopy (fluorescence). Nanotubes and nanorods will also be used as cylindrical templates for growth of calcite nanotubes.<br/><br/>If successful, the projects outlined here will bridge a gap between the recent advancements in understanding biomineralization processes at the molecular scale, and nanometer scale materials synthesis. From a materials science perspective, biominerals are advanced composite materials. Their complex structures are amazingly well designed for optimal mechanical performance as well as optical and magnetic functions.  This work will lend insight into multi-scalar biomineralization processes as well as suggest new avenues for materials synthesis.  The particular potential of nanophase calcite materials lies in areas as diverse as tissue engineering, non-linear optics, and labeling for advanced biological imaging.  This project will also inform the scientific content of several ongoing outreach and educational activities that the PI is engaged in. These include a nanoscience First Year Seminar Course as well as science education research on middle, high school and undergraduate concepts of scale and scaling.

Based on preliminary experience, it is expected that simulation turnaround will be reduced by several orders of magnitude, while achieving high accuracy and confidence in the simulation results.To estimate performance, SimFlex systematically selects a large number of short sampling units from a program execution. SimFlex performs detailed cycle-accurate measurement only within each sampling unit. SimFlex provides a collection of complementary techniques, including checkpointing, to rapidly generate the architectural and microarchitectural state necessary to initialize the cycle-accurate models before each sampled measurement. SimFlex uses statistical sampling theory to determine the minimally sized sample necessary to achieve simulation results at a desired degree of accuracy. Overall, only an exceedingly small fraction of the complete execution is simulated in detail. Preliminary investigation of the SimFlex framework in the context of an out-of-order superscalar uniprocessor (e.g., Intel Pentium 4) has resulted in a simulator that can estimate performance for SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks with a worst-case error of 2.4% and an average error of 0.6% relative to full-benchmark simulation by measuring a sample of only 50 million instructions per benchmark. In contrast, full-benchmark simulations require simulating up to trillions of instructions. The project,will explore and evaluate the effectiveness of sampling simulation of large-scale multiprocessor systems. A successful outcome of this research will permit, for the first time, simulating the execution of realistic workloads on large-scale (e.g., 64-1024 nodes) system sizes. The SimFlex framework will be evaluated for large-scale system simulation in the context of a cycle-accurate distributed shared-memory multiprocessor simulator. The proposed simulation framework will be based on Virtutech's Simics, a substrate that enables full-system emulation, boots an entire off-the-shelf OS (e.g., RedHat Linux or Sun Solaris), and can execute/emulate unmodified commercial applications (e.g., database, web, and file servers). The porject wu`ill enable integrate simulation sampling and checkpointing techniques to accelerate the simulation performance of this large-scale full-system simulator. The resulting detailed system simulator will enable performance study using realistic workloads and accurately capture not only application behavior but also OS interactions.

Although in situ bioremediation is promising, one major challenge that remains is how to effectively stimulate indigenous dehalorespirers in the presence of sorbed contaminants of limited bioavailability. The addition of alternative electron acceptors to contaminated sediment is able to successfully<br/>stimulate the growth of these organisms, encouraging the desorption and degradation of weathered contaminants. Alternative electron acceptors used to date have also been toxic and/or bioaccumulative, precluding their use in the environment. There is evidence that natural alternative electron acceptors for dehalorespirers exist. The proposed research is designed to test the hypothesis that dehalorespirers are a natural component of uncontaminated ecosystems, where their niche is the respiration of natural chlorinated organic compounds derived from humifying plant material.

0516233	Plant Diversity in the Montane and Submontane Forests of Southern Bahia and Northern EspÌrito Santo, Brazil	DEB	Biodiversity: Discov &Analysis, COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH	07/15/2005	07/26/2008	William Thomas	NY	New York Botanical Garden	Continuing grant	Elizabeth A. Kellogg	12/31/2008	$302,091.00	Andre Amorim	wthomas@nybg.org	2900 Southern Blvd	Bronx	NY	104585126	7188178840	BIO	1198, 7298	1198, 9169, EGCH, 5913, 5977	$0.00	The Atlantic coastal forest of Brazil is one of the World's biodiversity hotspots. It suffers severe deforestation and has high biological diversity, especially of species found nowhere else (endemic species). Collection of biological specimens from these highly fragmented forests is unevenly distributed, with most collections made in proximity to cities or large protected areas, or in more easily accessible areas near the coast. This narrow fringe of forest comprises several areas of high endemism for plants and many groups of animals. These include the coastal montane forests of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (Paulista area) and the moist forests of southern Bahia. The division between the Paulista area and the Bahia area coincides with a very poorly collected region of forests in northern Espirito Santo and extreme southern Bahia. It is hypothesized that increased collecting in the gap between the Paulista area and the Bahia area will show that this gap does not exist. It will demonstrate that species now known only from the submontane forests of Bahia will be found occurring in similar forests farther south and that plants known only from the montane forests of the Serra do Mar of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo will be found in the high elevation forests of northern Espirito Santo and southern Bahia. Staff of The New York Botanical Garden (NY), the Center for Cocoa Research (CEPEC), the State University of Santa Cruz, Bahia (UESC), and the Mello Leitao Biological Museum (MBML) of Santa Teresa, Espirito Santo, will collaborate and collect the vascular plants in the submontane and montane forests of southern Bahia and northern Espirito Santo, Brazil. The project, with support from the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Biodiversity Surveys and Inventories program , will have: 1) tested the hypotheses that there is no gap between the Paulista and Bahia centers of endemism, and that many montane and submontane species are less restricted in distribution than previously believed; 2) produced specimens that will be used by present and future biologists for expert identification, study, and descriptions of new species; 3) compiled a core checklist of the flora of the southern Bahian and northern Espirito Santo; and 4) reassessed patterns of plant endemism in the forests of eastern Brazil.<br/> This project will be critical to intelligent conservation in the Atlantic forest of eastern Brazil. The project team will find and highlight areas of submontane and montane forest for possible conservation. In addition, distributions of rare plant species will be better defined, permitting an assessment of criteria for the inclusion of each species on IUCN's Red List of threatened species. It is expected that these distributions will be seen to follow patterns of ecological zonation and the presence or absence of certain species in a given forest fragment will be predictable. Training of Brazilian botanists and NY graduate students will be another important byproduct of our research, as the US students travel to Brazil they will develop important collaborations for future work.
0522634	GSE/RES Learning Companions as Change Agents: Improving Girls' Self-efficacy Beliefs in Learning Math	HRD	RES ON GENDER IN SCI & ENGINE	09/01/2005	06/05/2007	Yanghee Kim	UT	Utah State University	Continuing grant	Jolene K. Jesse	08/31/2009	$499,991.00	Christine Hailey	yanghee.kim@usu.edu	Sponsored Programs Office	Logan	UT	843221415	4357971226	EHR	1544	9178, SMET	$0.00	Utah State University is investigating the educational potential of virtual peers to change girls' negative self-images and attitudes toward science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), moving them in a desirable direction. The virtual peers, called pedagogical agents as learning companions (PALs), may encourage and persuade girls to increase their belief of self-efficacy in learning math and to build more positive attitudes toward pursuing careers in STEM.<br/><br/>Research indicates that girls' negative views of the fields of STEM are often due to social and cultural influences. Family, schools, and media are likely to impose stereotypic role expectations on girls and infuse girls with ideal Barbie doll images of girls. As a result, many girls tend to identify STEM as masculine and doubt their ability to compete. Girls need to be exposed to social environments that will encourage them to overcome ungrounded social stereotypes and build constructive views of their competency in STEM. Although the stereotypic views of family, teachers, or friends cannot be immediately changed or influenced, girl-friendly virtual social environments can be created to help girls build positive attitudes toward STEM. <br/><br/>The project will 1) investigate the effectiveness of PALs in facilitating girls' self-confidence and efficacy in learning math and 2) investigate the characteristics of PALs critical to that end. To reach the goals, a three-year research agenda is planned. In the first year, the project will focus on the effects of the gender and age of PALs. The research will investigate whether gender (male vs. female) and age (adult vs. peer) are related to girls' choices of PALs as their learning partners and, subsequently, girls' self-efficacy and attitude change. In the second year, the project will focus on the effects of the competency and ethnicity of PALs. The research will be an investigation of whether PALs' competency (strong vs. weak) and ethnicity (Caucasian vs. Hispanic) have an impact on Caucasian and Hispanic girls' choices of PALs as their learning partners and, subsequently, girls' self-efficacy and attitude change. In the third year, the project will concentrate on the effects of the feedback type and emotion of PALs. The research will be an investigation of whether PALs' feedback type (harsh vs. nice) and emotion (empathetic vs. non-empathetic) will have an impact on girls' attribution of their success and failure, their self-efficacy, and their feelings of affability with PALs. The research questions will be answered using a quasi-experimental design and both quantitative and qualitative data. The sample will include approximately 200 9th-grade girls in required algebra I classes in public high schools in large and mid-size cities in a mountain-west state of the USA.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>First, unlike most technology-based interventions that have been focused on the cognitive aspect of learning, this project is geared toward the affective aspect of girls' math learning. This project will identify how PALs can be used to effect girls' math self-efficacy and positive attitude toward learning math. Second, PALs are a special subset of pedagogical agents and are grounded on findings from human-peer interaction research. This project will identify the specific characteristics of PALs that might affect girls' math self-efficacy and attitudes. Third, PAL-based interventions will be implemented in ordinary classrooms regularly throughout the semester. This project will provide classroom-based evidence on the educational value of PALs in K-12 settings and implications for long-term use.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The project is conducted through the collaborative efforts of a multidisciplinary team and so will yield implications for multiple communities, such as researchers in women/gender education, STEM education in general, educational technology, human/computer interaction, and artificial intelligence in education.<br/><br/>If found to be effective, PALs are potentially an efficient and cost-effective intervention to re-shape girls' STEM beliefs and attitudes, compared to human-mentoring programs. Through classroom implementation, the project has implications for PALs' role for improving Caucasian and minority girls' math self-efficacy and attitudes. The influential characteristics of PALs for PAL/learner relations identified in the project will provide implications for research on human relations as well as on human/computer interactions.

Specifically, averaging is used to analyze the termination of waves in spatially connected networks by reducing the complicated conductance-based models to scalar spatial models. Phase-plane methods are applied to the reduced systems. Averaging is also used at the single spike level to understand the transition between synchrony and asynchrony in coupled networks that have different types of connections. Population density methods and linearized stability analysis will distinguish between the onset of synchrony, clusters, and propagating waves in spatially distributed networks of neural oscillators. Indirect coupling between excitable and oscillatory cells will be analyzed using a combination of phase-resetting curves and the dispersive properties of excitable cables.<br/><br/>When neurons are connected together, they can often produce persistent activity. Such persistent activity has been implicated in short-term memory -- how an animal or human holds a thought. What kinds of interactions disrupt this and which are necessary to maintain the activity are some of the questions that are asked in this proposal. When activity is too persistent then certain pathologies arise such as epilepsy. Thus, one goal of this proposal is to understand how to strike a balance between the ability to produce stable persistent activity while preventing its pathological propagation into quiet regions. When neurons fire they communicate with other neurons and depending on the interactions, the result can be that the neurons want to fire together or they want to fire asynchronously. The latter is useful for persistent activity. Synchrony on the other hand is crucial for several normal physiological processes. For example, it is known that certain cells in the base of the brain organize the output of hormones. The electrical activity of these cells is synchronized yet the mechanisms for this synchrony remain unknown since there are no direct connections between the individual oscillating neurons. We will study mechanism through which indirect coupling can produce synchronous behavior. Tools and methods developed in this proposal will have applications well beyond neuroscience, as the questions of synchrony and propagation of information are ubiquitous in biology from the single cell level on up to the ecological interactions between populations.

The research has two goals: first,  correlated motions of individual particles via computational and theoretical investigation will be elucidated using a four-point correlation function. The second goal is a search for and evaluation of new self-consistent approximations for dynamics of kinetically constrained models. Understanding particles' motions in amorphous materials is important in a variety of different fields ranging from food preservation and drug stability to crystallization of amorphous materials. Also, new, better self-consistent approximations for the dynamics of simple model systems will be applied to more complicated and finally more realistic systems. It is hoped that these better self-consistent approximations will supplant the standard mode-coupling theory that is now often used to interpret simulations and experiments. The research is is having a broader impact on a range of biological and materials related applications.

Box 12219	Research Triangle Park	NC	277092219	9194740122	ENG	5373	2865, 9216, HPCC	$0.00	This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will investigate applications of Combinatorial Morse Theory in Reverse Engineering, a field that focuses on converting physical objects into a digital representation suitable for CAD, CAM, and CAE. The biggest challenge in this field is to automate the conversion process while producing a model that meets all the requirements of downstream applications. These requirements include both an accurate representation of features and a high degree of smoothness. Combinatorial Morse Theory relies on a single mathematical approach: the definition of a continuous function on a polygonal model and the decomposition of the surface based on the gradient flow of that function. One advantage of this over earlier approaches to the conversion problem is its flexibility obtained by adapting to and combining different analysis criteria. Morse theory is the key to computing patch layouts that naturally adapt to and follow the shape of the surface, a property that is difficult to achieve but necessary to automatically construct high-quality NURBS surfaces of scanned or triangulated CAD models.<br/><br/>The proposed algorithms will allow users to easily create accurate representations of scanned physical parts, thereby providing an efficient closed-loop between physical and digital at any phase of a product life cycle. This project will make strong research contributions in computer science and mechanical engineering by dealing with the practical applications of Morse Theory, automatic feature detection and patch layout. It will also make strong advances in the amount of information that can be extracted from a polygonal model. Commercial applications include design and analysis of complex shapes such as turbine blades, transmission housings, and engine blocks, creating digital inventory of legacy parts, historical preservation, mass customization and biometric shape reconstruction. These applications will allow manufacturing companies to be more competitive globally because it enables product differentiations and existing processes to be carried out efficiently, cost-effectively, and automatically. The societal impact of this technology includes the improvement of work environments due to reduction of dust, noise, and work-related injuries associated with traditional processes, prevention of loss of lives and equipment by enabling sampling based inspections as well as improvement of the quality life through customized medical devices, and apparel that conform perfectly to the wearer.

This project will advance current prediction models to make quantitative real-time forecasts and specifications of the Earth's electron radiation belts from L=3 to L=8. A radial diffusion model has been developed and has achieved great success in predicting the electron enhancements at geosynchronous orbit. However, the current model has only limited application because the model only produces daily averaged electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit. This project will enhance the model to make high time resolution (<1 hour) forecasts of energetic electron fluxes up to 48 hours in advance. It will also provide specifications of the radiation belt electrons from L=3 to L=8 for different local times. It will also examine the effectiveness of radial transport in accelerating electrons. The work will be mostly carried out by a graduate student under the supervision of the principal investigator. <br/><br/>The forecast and specification results will be posted and archived on the web to be accessible to the public and the website will be made interactive to allow interested researchers and industrial partners to acquire the results at specified times and locations.

Specifically, counts of globular cluster stars (i.e., luminosity functions) will be<br/>employed to determine evolutionary timescales. Also, internally-consistent photometry will be<br/>measured to compare stellar properties (luminosity, temperature) at different phases of evolution<br/>and at the same points of evolution across different clusters. Three aspects of the cluster colormagnitude<br/>diagrams will be examined: 1) The epoch of red giant branch ascent, including red giant<br/>evolutionary timescales, the red giant branch bump (its luminosity and sharpness), and the<br/>location of the red giant branch-tip; 2) horizontal branch and asymptotic giant branch morphologies,<br/>distributions, and evolution; and 3) blue stragglers and their radial distributions, distributions on the<br/>cluster color magnitude diagrams, and the presence of unusual blue straggler populations. The<br/>statistical nature of these investigations requires quality photometry of large samples of cluster stars<br/>which will be extracted from previously obtained wide field (for cluster outskirts) and high<br/>resolution (for cluster cores) images obtained at national and international observatories telescopes<br/>(plus archival images, including the Hubble Space Telescope where possible). Novel (within the<br/>astronomical community) statistics will also be employed in the analysis to assess<br/>significance/confidence levels of trends and relations.<br/>Undergraduate and Master's students at San Diego will be heavily involved in this work - both with<br/>the reduction and analysis of the astronomical data and the application of advanced statistical<br/>methods.

This instrument will add state-of-the-art lithography, imaging and analysis capabilities to the Micro and Nano-Electronics Laboratory (MiNEL) at South Dakota State University. Related to intellectual merit, this equipment will support several ongoing and proposed interdisciplinary research projects in nano-sensor research and development, as well as other research projects from other departments on campus including chemistry, biology and dairy science. These projects include the development of a new sensing structures for monitoring air quality and analysis of DNA; improvement of the texture and functionality of process cheese; the development of a research program in nano structured photovoltaic devices; The Identification of Volcanic Ash Particles in Antarctica Ice Cores; and the assembly of virus-like particles by arterivirus-encoded proteins. Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity include using this instrument to enhance research and education infrastructure by adding instructional laboratory modules in several disciplines including engineering, chemistry, pharmacy, biology and dairy science. Native Americans, an underrepresented group, will benefit by a project to incorporate an SEM workshop into an existing outreach program focused on a major regional Native American high school. Economic development will be supported by joint projects with local industry. Presenting research results at local and state economic development meetings will help demonstrate the connection between research and societal benefit such as improved homeland security and health. Broader audiences such as K-12 students will be reached by a web site featuring images taken by the SEM. This instrumentation will also strengthen a recently established state interdisciplinary nanotechnology research center and a regional nanotechnology initiative.

VUV light in the form of synchrotron radiation, pulsed laser-generated radiation, and rare gas resonance lamps will be utilized to study both large and small particles. The reactivity of model aerosols will be examined as a function of their morphology.  The reaction rates of coated particles as well as particles consisting of organics embedded in porous particles with ozone will be measured in the laboratory.  A major emphasis will be on identification of organic constituents in secondary organic aerosols and species generated by gas-particle reactions.  A rare gas resonance lamp will be installed to investigate its use for detecting small particles in smog chamber studies that do not lend themselves to pulsed laser ionization.  As well, experiments at the Advanced Light Source will be directed at controlled nucleation studies in a laboratory reaction chamber.  <br/><br/>Many naturally occurring small particles in the environment are highly heterogeneous, containing mixtures of carbon, salts, metals, and organic molecules.  When these particles are in contact with certain gases, the chemical reactions that occur will be affected by the particle properties.  New experimental methods to study aerosol particles will be developed in this project.  In addition, the new methods will be used to examine aerosol formation in controlled atmospheres that mimic real-world environmental systems.  This research will be carried out by students and postdoctoral associates, who will be broadly trained in physical, analytical, and environmental chemistry.<br/>

However, we will demonstrate that molecules behaving similarly to macroscopic robots can indeed display simple forms of cooperation and adaptation, when challenged with certain tasks. These molecular robots which we call snakes consists of chains of nucleic acids incorporating multiple catalytic units. They move (walk) over landscapes covered with substrates, leaving a trail of cleaved substrates behind them. We will study the ability of these molecular robots to integrate additional catalytic segments (limbs) from the solution, or to form dimers, when we force them to perform longer walks. Those snakes that acquire additional limbs, or form cooperating dimers, while surviving harsh conditions, will be allowed to amplify. Such experiments will help create in the future molecular robots that display swarm intelligence and that are capable of distributive computing.

Specifically, the project addresses the utility of the psychological components of the expectancy-value model for understanding the role of gender differences in STEM-related choices. It also examines the role the gender make-up of the robotics team and the motivation for participating in the program play in girls' STEM perceptions, expectations, and choices.<br/><br/>Robotics provides a comprehensive view of an integrated system. It illustrates the connection between mechanical, electrical, and computing components. Because of its multidisciplinary nature, the use of robotics in the classroom has become a useful tool for the practical, hands-on application of concepts across various STEM topics. There is clear evidence that shows robotics projects are engaging educational tools and have been pedagogically successful in teaching STEM concepts. However, it is less clear whether such projects translate into long-term interests in STEM areas of study and, ultimately, career choices.<br/><br/>The project involves participants in the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics' Botball Program. The Botball Program is a team-based activity that engages thousands of middle school and high school students in regional and national robotics competitions and exhibitions. The project employs a mixed methodology research approach to gain a rich understanding of the factors involved in STEM perceptions and choices. To examine the expectancy-value model, quantitative analyses including ANCOVA and structural equation modeling will be employed. The quantitative study is complemented with a qualitative approach. The qualitative study, which includes observations, interviews, and artifact analysis, will enable a deeper understanding of the effect of participation in robotics projects and permit the examination of role cultural issues may play in STEM choices.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit  <br/>The most significant intellectual merit is due to the use of: 1) the expectancy value model; 2) a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods; 3) both explicit and implicit attitudes measures; and 4) a unique qualitative methodology in which participants in the study will assist us in data collection. By applying the expectancy-value theory, the study provides the most comprehensive view of the factors involved in a girl's STEM experience and how this experience affects self-perception. The combined interpretation of the comprehensive qualitative/qualitative study will provide a clearer understanding of how programs that apply technology, like robotics, affect girls' perceptions of their abilities, how specific factors engendered in the expectancy-value model impact these perceptions, and how these effects influence choices to enter STEM careers. The two year study will help determine if impacts are short term or longer lasting. And if they are longer lasting what are factors that sustain or even strengthen girls' motivations for achieving goals in STEM areas.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The most significant broader impact is that the study dovetails directly with work in curriculum development at KIPR and SIUE. KIPR has a continuing NASA Grant and a working relationship with NASA Educators for the development of STEM curriculum and SIUE has an ongoing educational effort for the development of robotics curriculum for K-12 outreach and undergraduate courses.  Results will allow programs such as Botball, FIRST Robot League, Tufts University Next Steps Program, CMU's Expanding Your Horizon Program, and many others to target factors in their programs that actually impact a girl's STEM-related choices.   Dissemination will be aimed at educators, educational researchers, and developmental psychologists.<br/>

Males may either compete directly for access to females (male-male competition) or they may have traits that serve to entice females to mate with them (female choice).  Mating success can also be a function of whether males guard their mates after mating to prevent other males from mating with them or leave their mates to search for additional females.  Preliminary evidence on research with the Mallard duck suggests that levels of testosterone (T) can affect a male's mating strategy.  High levels of T seem to promote mate guarding, but also the tendency for males to aggressively seek and pursue females for additional matings. The proposed research investigates the variance in male reproductive tactics, especially as they relate to levels of T.  Levels of T will be manipulated in captive male Mallards in large outdoor semi-natural enclosures.  The various reproductive tactics used by males will be correlated with levels of T.  Additionally, this research seeks to identify regions of the brain that may be involved in various male mating tactics.  These experiments will be conducted by undergraduate researchers, whose contributions have been integral and absolutely essential to the PI's research. Undergraduate research at the PI's institution (University of Wisconsin at Whitewater) as a whole is increasing steadily, and continued support is important in providing a learning environment that trains future scientists and clinicians in true scientific discovery. Moreover, UWW has a mission to provide opportunity for underrepresented students (ethnic minorities, disabled students, women, first generation college students).

The interface between semiconductor materials and high dielectric constant insulators, and the interface between metals and these high dielectric insulators is the focus of this research project. Photoemission, inverse photoemission, scanning probe microscopy and ion scattering methods are all used to characterize the interface between semiconductors or metals and high dielectric oxides such as HfO2, Al2O3, or Gd2O3. Fundamental understanding gained from this work allows the push to even smaller silicon based electronic devices. <br/><br/>An understanding of the interfacial chemistry in ultra small scale electronic devices is crucial to the design and production of smaller and smaller electronic chips. Professor Garfunkel and his colleagues at Rutgers are using modern surface science methods to obtain a fundamental understanding of this interfacial chemistry involving high dielectric constant materials. The results of this work will strongly impact the semiconductor industry's next generation designs.

The project is in theoretical computer science, combining computational complexity theory, algorithms, and quantum informatics. It aims to find new quantum algorithms for important problems, and study the possibilities of ultrafast quantum computation via small-depth quantum circuits. A number of group theoretic algorithms, such as Hidden Subgroup, Hidden Translation, Group Intersection, have quantum algorithms for only a small class of groups. Recent techniques may widen the class of problems amenable to quantum solution. Our goal is to apply these techniques and develop new techniques for exanding the class of groups with fast quantum algorithms. Long quantum computations, corresponding to deep quantum circuits, may be difficult to maintain due to decoherence, The project therefore also focuses on computations that can<br/>be performed by very shallow circuits that are (of necessity) enhanced with highly nonlocal interactions (multibit gates) as primitives. One such multibit gate that has been shown to be quite powerful for shallow quantum circuits is the fanout gate, which copies a bit from one register to several other registers in one step. Recent work by the PI has shown that the fanout gate arises naturally from applying certain potentially feasible variants of well-understood spin-spin interactions between particles in a group. The project will study new ways in which fanout and other, similarly powerful, multibit gates may be ultimately implemented. The project will also continue work by the PI and others, studying the intrinsic strengths and weaknesses of shallow quantum circuits in general.<br/>Intellectual merit of the proposed activity<br/>Results of the project are rigorously mathematical in nature. They will be based both on the PI's expertise in computational complexity theory and on his contact with other computer scientists. The project will contribute to a basic understanding of feasible quantum computation.<br/>Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity<br/>The project will promote collaborations between the University of South Carolina, an EPSCoR institution, and other institutions top-tier institutions, as well as collaboration among different departments at USC (Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science). Graduate students will be intimately involved with the research, contributing to their Masters and Doctoral degrees. Results will be submitted to journals and conferences, and will be quickly disseminated on line in well-known archives such as<br/>http://arxiv.org/quant-ph and the Electronic Colloquium for Computational Complexity.

The first field of study are<br/>nonmonotone growth models; the investigator aims to study<br/>their growth shapes and space-covering properties by extending<br/>renewal, rescaling and perturbation techniques from probability,<br/>as well as various geometric methods. Also being developed are<br/>new analytic and computational approaches to higher dimensional<br/>and long range models, and to connections with differential<br/>and integral equations. An important example of a high-dimensional<br/>space is the hypercube, where the investigator uses<br/>combinatorial and probabilistic methods to understand the<br/>effect of uncorrelated and correlated random environments<br/>on basic growth processes.<br/><br/>In a broad scientific context, the aim of this project is<br/>to understand principles by which various physical systems<br/>propagate disturbances. Among instances of such growth<br/>dynamics are growth of snowflakes and other crystals, spread<br/>of epidemics, propagation of waves, competition between species,<br/>and genetic diversification. The investigator's research sheds<br/>light on how microscopic properties of a growth process influence<br/>its space-covering ability, on the effect of perturbations in<br/>the environment and in the dynamics, and on the role of dimension<br/>and range of interaction. For example, simple mathematical metaphors<br/>for neutral mutations, incompatibilities and harshness of the<br/>environment contribute to understanding the onset of genetic<br/>diversity. The project has an essential computational component<br/>and is developing a variety of efficient computer algorithms<br/>for simulation and visualization of complex processes. Finally,<br/>ample opportunities for undergraduate involvement in studying<br/>complex and random dynamics help to popularize mathematics and<br/>its applications.

The investigators plan to construct individual phantoms of AAAs from CT scans of patients, and use the phantoms to analyze and characterize the flow patterns through the phantoms under both steady and pulsatile conditions. In the next phase of the project, arterial endothelial cells will be seeded on to the interior wall of the phantoms and allowed to multiply. Then the phantoms are tested under the specific flow and stress tests as determined earlier in the project. Finally, the cells are tested for certain selected markers which affect the arterial wall elasticity and the possibility of rupture. The project offers a balanced integration of engineering techniques, molecular biology and medicine.

Brain circuitry that includes the hippocampus is essential for forming explicit memories, such as memory for facts, personal history and events. This project tests the influence of SK channels on brain and behavioral mechanisms of explicit memory. The central hypothesis is that SK2 channels restrict the functional output of hippocampal neurons that may be necessary for synaptic plasticity and memory. The specific aims of the studies to test this hypothesis are to:<br/> Determine the individual contributions of SK1, SK2, and SK3 channels to hippocampal learning and memory using transgenic mice strains (Aim 1). Mice that selectively lack SK2 channels are expected to have improved memory, while mice that overexpress SK2 channels are expected to have impaired memory. <br/> Determine the specific influence of hippocampal SK channels on the memory processes of encoding, retention and retrieval (Aim 2). This will be determined by direct administration of SK channel blockers or activators into the hippocampus of C57BL/6J mice. Blocking SK channels is expected to improve memory encoding, while activation of SK channels is expected to impair memory encoding.<br/>Defining how SK channels regulate hippocampal memory will improve the understanding of the behavioral and brain mechanisms of learning and memory. This project will provide opportunities for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students to gain expertise in the science of learning and memory. The research will also serve as a focus for scientific outreach programs directed to the broader community.

The idea that selective culling of infected animals by predators can decrease parasitism is not new, yet there have been no large-scale, controlled experiments testing the effects of selective predation on parasitism. Further, the effect of predation is not always straightforward: in many cases, a predator can also facilitate parasite transmission by dispersing eggs or spores of the parasite throughout the environment. In these cases, the combined effects of predation on parasitism are unclear. I have developed an epidemiological model that incorporates selective predation of infected animals as well as survival of parasite spores, which are released back into the environment. The proposed research will test the predictions of this model using fungus-infected zooplankton and fish predators as a model system. This will provide the first experimental test of the effects of predation on parasitism. Rates of parasitism are predicted to increase in the near future as a result of anthropogenic environmental stresses; however, this prediction is based on incomplete knowledge of the factors controlling parasitism. Contributing to this knowledge is an important broader impact of this proposal. Additional broader impacts include training a graduate student and an undergraduate at the interface of mathematical and experimental field ecology, and the dissemination of project results on the internet.

A fundamental aspect of damage/failure mechanisms is that they usually initiate at the micro/nano-structural level and it is important to study the relationship between micro/nano-structures and mechanical properties. Currently, there is no precise understanding of the degradation of chemical elements at multiple scales and the relationship with mechanical properties and material integrity. Developing models and algorithms is essential for exploring degradation caused by a variety of chemical elements, and their interplay at multiple levels. The overall goal of the proposed project is to identify the degradation of various chemical elements during the corrosion process. Controlled experiments, analytical microscopy techniques, and computational intelligence models will be developed to analyze and interpret the evolution of damage and the integrity of the material. The intellectual merit of the proposed research stems from integrating the Multiscale Computational Intelligence Models approach with experimental validation and simulations. It offers a unique and novel way to design in a seamless fashion multi-functional materials for specific environmental conditions. Synthesizing new materials guided by chemical elements degradation has the potential to develop a new generation of multifunctional materials. NON-TECHNICAL: The broad impact of this proposed research will provide valuable basic developments in new materials technology tools and also make key contributions to the growing area of development of multi-functional metals for a variety of technologies in aerospace, civil, and heavy machinery fields. Potential applications of such materials include smart metals, and self-regulating metals. The research also provides an environment for developing state-of-the-art metal degradation methodology for further dissemination and applications. The benefits to society may include the development of chemically tailored metals for a variety of every day engineering applications. Overall, the proposed research will greatly advance existing computational techniques by capturing and linking micro- and nano-scale material/structural information in a multidisciplinary fashion and leading to the development of intelligent metals for a variety of engineering applications. The students including from underrepresented groups involved in the project will be encouraged to present their results in meetings, open houses, and lab tours to promote and to attract their fellow students into this exciting technology. The models/algorithms developed through this project will be directly used in materials, modeling, and simulation courses. Outreach activities with high school students are also planned during the course of the project.

Although A. albopictus is superior to O. triseriatus in resource competition, in the field, there is little evidence that O. triseriatus is displaced by A. albopictus.  Unlike native O. triseriatus, A. albopictus does not modify its behavior in response to T. rutilus predation risk.  The investigators will test the hypothesis that this lack of behavioral responses to T. rutilus predation leads to greater vulnerability to predation, which prevents it from displacing O. triseriatus.  In addition, the investigators will test whether:  (1) competitive interactions between the two prey species are modified by the presence of water-borne (presumably chemical) predation risk cues from T. rutilus; (2) natural abundances of O. triseriatus and A. albopictus increase and decrease, respectively, with the abundance of T. rutilus; (3) there are differences among populations of A. albopictus in behavioral responses to predation risk cues; and 4) a consistent laboratory regimen of predation causes evolution of greater anti-predatory behavioral responses in A. albopictus.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: Educational impacts of this research include the completion of the Ph.D. by a graduate student and research experiences for undergraduates who will aid in the laboratory research.  Practical impacts include increased knowledge of the role of predators in population limitation of vectors of human disease, and more generally, in limitation of exotic invasive species.<br/>

The main characteristics of the approach are:<br/>(1) the noise is introduced in a physically motivated manner; (2)<br/>the stochastic problem is reduced to a problem for the mean flow<br/>and another for its variance; and (3) an efficient implementation<br/>is developed involving state-of-the-art spectral discretization<br/>and stochastic integration numerical techniques. <br/><br/> The equations governing hydrodynamics, the Navier-Stokes<br/>equations, have been known for well over a century and have been<br/>successful in describing many observed physical flows. <br/>Nevertheless, the transition to complex flow and turbulence<br/>remains an outstanding challenge; it is not clear what role noise<br/>plays here.

The combined use of mathematical modeling<br/>of stochastic processes, design of numerical algorithms, computer<br/>simulations of physical problems and direct comparison with<br/>experimental observations provides an enriching experience for the<br/>students directly involved in the project.

They provide unique insights into the mechanisms of biomolecular activity, aid in the interpretation and integration of experimental information, and - increasingly - contribute to the design of novel biomolecular and supramolecular systems.  The work that will be conducted during the next project period will add to the theoretical foundations for such studies, contribute a variety of new simulation tools, and apply simulations to probe the activity of important biological systems.  In the theory area, ongoing efforts to improve the rigor of free energy calculations will be extended with the goal of forging practical new methods for the study of molecular recognition.  In the area of simulation tools, algorithms and codes will be created to allow faster exploration of the conformations of biopolymers and to enable molecular dynamics simulations at constant pH.  Challenging new applications are planned to explore the biophysics of protein kinase regulation and the action of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.<br/><br/>This project will develop and apply methods for using computers to understand the activity of biological molecules.  Computational tools that will emerge during the next period will include enhancements to several widely used software packages to allow molecular dynamics simulations at constant pH, enhanced sampling via accelerated molecular dynamics, and more accurate calculations of free energy.  The PI will continue to distribute all codes developed in the next project period as freely as possible.  The training of young scientists will continue to be a central focus of the PI's group.  More than a dozen group members moved on to tenure-track faculty positions in the current project period.  A similar number of undergraduates participated in research prior to going on to graduate school; many of these students are first authors of journal articles based on their work, and several are from underrepresented groups in science.  During the next project period, all of these recruitment activities will continue.  Group members will also continue to have the opportunity to teach in regular courses at UCSD and in summer schools offered by the NSF Center for Theoretical Biological Physics.  This contributes to the success of the PI's group in training young scientists for academic and research careers, and also represents a valuable outreach activity to the scientific community.<br/>

Work will occur in two theoretical areas, specifically continuing the development of simple models including Landau-Dykne-type excitation and multi-electron nonadiabatic excitation schemes, and continuing a collaboration to develop Ehrenfest-type dynamics to understand and control better the excitation of polyatomic molecules in intense laser fields. Outcomes are expected to enable new understanding of the photophysical processes occurring in larger and more complex molecular systems in the presence of intense, ultrafast laser light.<br/><br/>Outcomes from this research, in the long run, are expected to assist in the development of high technology chemistries.

To be more specific, the goal of this research is to develop a framework in which to implement low-complexity H.264 encoding to provide maximum quality compressed structured video.  Because the developed algorithms will be H.264 standard-compliant, an off-the-shelf H.264 decoder can be used.<br/><br/>The research applies to any class of videos where there is some inherent structure that can be exploited.  The five areas of research are: (1) Design of an appropriate objective distortion metric for ASL; (2) Design of algorithms to preprocess video for display on small devices; (3) Development of methods to exploit structure in video for efficient coding; (4) Implementation of a rate-distortion-complexity optimization of H.264 using the new metric; and (5) Applications of the framework to other structured video such as surveillance video.  Studies with ASL users are used to develop the objective intelligibility metric and to evaluate the new compression techniques.<br/><br/>
0528225	Collaborative Research: Stochastic Sensing Control Models for Safe and Efficient Traffic Signal Strategies	CMMI	CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS	08/01/2005	04/27/2007	Srinivas Peeta	IN	Purdue University	Continuing grant	Dennis Wenger	07/31/2008	$265,000.00	Darcy Bullock	peeta@purdue.edu	Young Hall	West Lafayette	IN	479072114	7654941055	ENG	1631	1057, CVIS	$0.00	Abstract for CMS-0528225 and CMS-0528143<br/><br/>Over the past decade, the ability to obtain detailed, reliable and time-dependent traffic flow data has tended to mostly emphasize strategic level control algorithms for large systems of controllers in the real-time traffic control context. These algorithms are typically targeted at large urban areas and depend on rather extensive and costly detector placements. They do not cost-effectively address isolated intersections in semi-urban or rural areas, where either extensive system-wide detector installation cannot be economically justified, or signalized intersections are spatially sparse precluding a systems perspective. The investigator and his colleagues develop a range of tactical stochastic sensing control models that enhance the safety and efficiency at signalized intersections. They use a probabilistic paradigm that is consistent with state-of-the-art technological capabilities of existing signals, is sensitive to user requirements, and captures the time-dependency and randomness. This new paradigm is incorporated in a probabilistic control layer that works within the existing traffic control framework. It explicitly acknowledges that the arrival process of vehicles to a traffic intersection is stochastic in several respects, representing a shift from the current standard practice of signal control logic where this randomness is implicitly incorporated to some extent through actuated control. However, the current actuated logic is methodologically limited in capturing the vagaries of vehicle headways under multiple lanes, the influence of weather, the effect of vehicle arrivals on the competing phases, as well as in exploiting the rich array of readily-available historical data. It also lacks a robust mechanism to safely terminate the green by ensuring dilemma zone protection. The proposed methodology for signal control logic: (i) is probabilistic to reflect the multiple facets of randomness associated with the operation of signalized intersections, (ii) can exploit valuable historical data in addition to the current conditions reflected by real-time data, (iii) can enhance operational robustness through strategic sensor placements, (iv) can incorporate a holistic view of the intersection rather than focusing on just the intersection approaches corresponding to the current phase, (v) is technology-neutral to accommodate a variety of sensing technologies, and (vi) can react to inclement weather conditions and special events. The study leverages existing state-of-the-art traffic signal laboratory facilities (Purdue University instrumented intersections in West Lafayette and Noblesville, IN as well as the Traffic Operations Laboratory at the University of Tennessee). Rather than just use sensor data passively, the study incorporates data from the instrumented intersections and prototype models and algorithms into actual laboratory-based closed loop signal control systems. This represents a significant technological paradigm for the next generation of sensor-based methodologies that are less tolerant of performance inefficiencies and safety drawbacks for traffic systems. <br/><br/>Our society is continuing to demand safer and more efficient roadways. Traditional traffic signal control uses deterministic algorithms which are reliable, but frequently inefficient in their allocation of green time. As traffic congestion increases, it is necessary to obtain more efficiency out of existing systems. This study reduces delay and improves safety at the widely prevalent rural and suburban isolated intersections by developing new probabilistic paradigms that exploit advances in information and sensor technologies. The proposed approaches incorporate a new control layer that is compatible with control infrastructure, thereby allowing direct implementation of this research without large and expensive upgrades to signal system infrastructure. The study reduces dilemma zone exposure and increases operational efficiency. Reduced dilemma zone exposure reduces human factors related crashes. More efficient operations reduce fossil fuel consumption and vehicle emissions. The proposed solutions are a paradigm shift compared to methodological constructs adopted for the past four decades, and are synergistically enabled by the rich array of data afforded by advances in sensor and information technologies. The study also contributes to current efforts on developing a national network of traffic signal control laboratories that leverage capabilities at geographically distributed universities.

Zanzerkia	06/30/2007	$144,021.00		dreger@seismo.berkeley.edu	Sponsored Projects Office	BERKELEY	CA	947045940	5106428109	GEO	1574	0000, 1576, 9196, OTHR	$0.00	The Parkfield segment of the San Andreas fault has been intensively monitored with a broad array of geophysical instrumentation in anticipation of recording the next in a series of earthquakes that repeat on average approximately every 22 years. Although the official prediction for the occurrence of the event in 1988 +- 5 years (Bakun and Lindh, 1985) failed, fortunately the monitoring efforts continued. On September 28, 2004 a magnitude 6 earthquake occurred, and it has produced a wealth of new data to study the mechanics of the faulting process both coseismically (at the time of the mainshock) and postseismically. The 2004 Parkfield earthquake is arguably the best recorded to date with observations of near-fault strong ground motion, continuous GPS, surface creep, borehole strain, ground water and EM signals, as well as regional broadband waveform data. In the proposed research a high-resolution model of the rupture process, namely the distribution of fault slip in both space and time will be determined from local and more distant seismic instruments as well as surface deformation obtained from GPS. Additionally a postseismic slip model will be obtained from the continuous GPS data. These high-resolution models will then be used to calculate the stress change on the fault and relate it to the behavior of aftershocks, characteristically repeating earthquakes (whose behavior was changed by the occurrence of the mainshock), and postseismic slip giving insight into the fault zone rheology. Regional and teleseismic records of the previous Parkfield earthquakes in 1922, 1934, and 1966 are available and will be compared with similar records for the 2004 event to evaluate the characteristic earthquake hypothesis for large events in the region. This project will address fundamental questions about the relationships between mainshocks, aftershocks, pre-event seismicity, and post-seismic deformation. It will also address the question of source parameter resolution of fault slip inversions with the goal of better understanding underlying rupture dynamics and the earthquake hazard application of near-realtime ground motion reporting.

It focuses on<br/>active network tomography where end-to-end traffic measurements are obtained by actively probing the network. The project examines a number of important and interesting statistical issues dealing with the collection, modeling, and analysis of network data using active tomography. Specifically, it introduces a new, flexible class of probing experiments that has advantages over the current schemes. The investigators will study several research issues related to the design of efficient flexicast probing experiments: questions of identifiability, construction of efficient designs, optimal allocation of test probes (according to some suitable metric), and real-time monitoring strategies to detect and localize network problems. A substantial portion of the research deals with estimation and inference for a large-scale inverse problem with missing data. The focus is on fast and scalable algorithms for estimating packet loss rates and delay distributions and their asymptotic properties. Furthermore, new models for spatial and temporal dependence that capture the main features of network traffic will be introduced and the behavior of various estimation methods under these models will be analyzed. Finally, an important component of this research program is the validation of the proposed models and techniques on real data. Present day computer networks have evolved into large, complex, decentralized systems. There is a great deal of interest in estimating key network performance parameters and quality of service indicators, such as traffic intensities, link delays and dropped packet rates, and in identifying bottleneck nodes and detecting network failures in the form of connectivity, routing faults and malicious activity. However, the lack of centralized control makes the quantitative assessment of network performance a rather difficult task, since detailed queueing and traffic models do not capture their complexity and characteristics well. Network tomography is capable of assessing the performance of large-scale networks and in localizing anomalous behavior to individual components and subnetworks. The understanding and insights gained as a result of the proposed research will lead to a core of basic principles and a toolkit of key statistical methods and techniques for the analysis and design of network monitoring schemes. Efficient and scalable network monitoring could significantly benefit network control and provisioning by incorporating the necessary information into admission, flow and routing control protocols. The proposed techniques and algorithms will be integrated into an open source tool, called FLEXICAST. The research program will also be integrated into the educational activities of the Department of Statistics. Planned efforts include training of graduate and undergraduate students, the development of a new course, stimulation of collaborations with students and<br/>faculty in Engineering, and interaction with the networking community to help transfer the research results to industry.

The initial empirical verification was made for the occurrence of rainfall along the Nile River. Subsequent empirical verifications have been made for economic data (e.g. stock prices), telecommunications (e.g. ATM traffic), and medicine (e.g. the occurrence of epileptic seizures). In this project a stochastic calculus for fractional Brownian motion with H in (1/2, 1) is used to investigate the solutions of stochastic differential equations with a fractional Brownian motion. Physical phenomena are often modeled by stochastic differential equations. Bilinear stochastic differential equations have been used extensively in modeling so the solutions of finite dimensional bilinear equations with a fractional Brownian motion will be investigated to determine explicit solutions in a variety of cases with noncommuting linear operators appearing in the equations by using a stochastic calculus and some Lie theoretic methods. Furthermore, bilinear stochastic differential equations in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space will be investigated because they serve as models for some important stochastic partial differential equations. Parameter identification for stochastic systems is a basic component of the modeling problem. For linear stochastic differential equations with a fractional Brownian motion, a weighted pseudo least squares method for estimation will be investigated to verify the convergence of the family of estimators. The effect of time discretizations of the continuous time least squares estimation algorithm for the parameters of a linear stochastic system is important because typically the observations of the system state are sampled. This effect will be investigated for linear systems with a fractional Brownian motion to determine if biases persist as the sampling intervals approach zero. The determination and the application of the question of absolute continuity for the measure of a fractional Brownian motion will be addressed by a method of martingales that are obtained as stochastic integrals of a fractional Brownian motion. The Radon-Nikodym derivative for this absolute continuity will be applied to problems of stochastic control, filtering, and the calculation of mutual information.<br/><br/>Stochastic models provide useful descriptions of physical phenomena. The stochastic models are used to describe random or unknown perturbations of a system or unmodeled dynamics. Fractional Brownian motion is a class of stochastic processes whose usefulness has been empirically verified for many physical phenomena that occur in a wide variety of fields, such as, hydrology, economic data, telecommunications and medicine. Stochastic differential equations with a fractional Brownian motion that are formally differential equations with an additive fractional Brownian motion, are an important class of stochastic models for physical phenomena. Some collections of these stochastic differential equations will be investigated. The estimation of parameters of a stochastic model will be investigated because of its importance for modeling. Some other questions for these stochastic differential equations will also be investigated.

However, despite its critical importance, today's Internet is extremely fragile and suffers from frequent attacks. One of the main reasons for the security vulnerabilities of today's Internet is that the Internet protocols and architecture were designed for a trustworthy environment. This assumption is clearly no longer valid in today's Internet, connecting millions of people, computers, and corporations distributed throughout the world. Many researchers have studied how to secure the Internet, mostly by proposing patches to address current vulnerabilities. However, partial solutions and ad hoc mechanisms often do not address the root cause of the problems, and hence will not be able to eradicate the current problems and prevent them from manifesting in different forms in the future. Moreover, security patches and ad hoc security solutions increase network complexity, which in turn increases vulnerability. Thus, we need a radical new design for a next-generation Internet, which is designed ground-up from sound principles. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The principal investigators (PIs) plan a series of efforts to engage the community in systematically exploring this important question of how to provide the next-generation Internet with a set of fundamental security design principles and mechanisms that will provide the next generation Internet with provable security guarantees. One part of the planning effort is one or more workshops. Starting from a clean-slate approach, participants in the workshops will investigate the fundamental issues in designing a secure next generation Internet, which not only removes many of the current security problems but also provides provable security guarantees against unforeseen future attacks. The deployment of a next-generation secure Internet will likely start out as a research test bed. Such an infrastructure will attract applications requiring high-assurance, resulting in a transition of hosts to the secure Internet. The success of such a test bed critically depends on the collaboration of researchers in networking, architecture, and security. A distributed effort with many small projects is unlikely to have the same impact as a coordinated collaborative research effort. This planning effort will provide coordination of research efforts and establishing community consensus for promising research directions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This effort will involve the networking and security communities to establish a consensus on what security properties to provide in the network, and to establish promising research directions for designing a secure next-generation secure Internet. Included in this effort is a workshop with 30-40 networking and security experts from industry and academia to further explore and define a research direction for the next-generation secure Internet. The PIs will produce a report to communicate the results from this planning activity to the broader research community. Through a series of meetings, organized discussions, presentations, this effort will build a roadmap and help the community to reach consensus on what the important research directions are and how the different research efforts work together to achieve the desired goal of designing and implementing a testbed of an architecture for a next-generation secure Internet.

Upwelling is a defining factor of El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) in the eastern Pacific, particularly along the coast of Peru. Historical records of this phenomenon are limited and older proxy records in this region are few. The proposal will exploit the ventilation age difference between equatorial surface and deeper upwelled waters. The detection of El Nino events will be made by screening for shell increment alteration and by sequential d18O analysis. The simultaneous excursions in d 18O and D14C in molluscan shell identify periods of upwelling variation caused by El Ninos. By providing data of Peruvian Holocene upwelling this project will provide understanding of paleo-ENSO and give insight into past deep water circulation. Furthermore, the large increase in the database of regional D R data will improve age-dating in many disciplines. Broader impacts of this research also include graduate and undergraduate student training through participation in all stages of research.

Additional goals include the attainment of basic information concerning the nature of the virus, its pathogenesis, and the optimal laboratory methods for its diagnosis. This project will lead to a better understanding of the circumstances that favor the emergence of new viral diseases in avian species, how the lifestyles of these species affect disease maintenance and spread, and the impact of a new disease on a small fragmented and managed avian population. Avian viral diseases have become of increasing concern, especially with the spread of avian flu. The proposed research could become a model system for the study of disease ecology in avian viruses. The populations being studied are endangered and this work will be crucial for population management.

First, it is focusing on using robotics, in particular the Sony AIBOs, in the classroom as a way of attracting a more diverse population of undergraduates to Computer Science programs. Multiple courses are being developed, starting from the very beginning of the computer science curriculum. Second, it is extending Pyro, an easy to use programming system for robots written in Python, to support the Scout miniature robot. The Scout has unparalleled features in terms of its combination of small size and ability to move fast over large distances. And third, it is performing a thorough evaluation of the resulting course material with the help of independent evaluators. The goal of this project is to increase the interest of underrepresented groups for studying Computer Science and to provide them with tools that will help throughout their undergraduate years. Course materials that are especially interesting for women and underrepresented groups are being developed, based on the use of the AIBO and Scout robots, in order to both attract them to consider studying computer science and to give them the initial background they need to succeed in the CS courses.

Specific scientific studies currently underway at UHD that will utilize an STA-QMS include: 1) phase structure and transitions in polymers, 2) compositional effects on the thermomechanical properties of natural and synthetic obsidians, 3) determination of volatile species in fluid inclusions related to ore deposits, and 4) determination of the thermal properties of oil bearing rocks.<br/><br/>Integrating the thermal analyzer with mass spectrometry results in a powerful analytical tool for characterizing thermal decomposition. The instrument provides accurate weight loss or weight gain data of solids while simultaneously measuring the concentrations of the product gases to provide kinetic data needed for process evaluation. These studies will help to identify advanced materials for energy generation.

The chemistry is challenging, as inappropriate modifications may abolish the fungicidal activity of the molecules, and their specific chemical properties make them hard to work with. The methodologies developed here will be applicable not only to the set of chemistries described here, but to surface modification in general. The potential uses are also broad, ranging from the prevention of fouling of industrial fermenters, sewage systems, and shipping hulls, to preventing fungal infections of catheters. The project follows a systematic approach whereby molecules are synthesized to predetermined specifications, tested in vitro against C. albicans, and then - if shown to be effective - tested in animals for efficacy and safety.

Like other arid ecosystems, the Chihuahuan Desert is at risk from a variety of anthropogenic activities including development, overgrazing by livestock, pollution, and aquifer depletion. While it has been suggested that the Chihuahuan Desert possesses a large number of unique species, relatively few studies have been focused on its aquatic habitats. There are two components to this project. (A) Diversity of aquatic invertebrates focusing on rotifers and small crustaceans will be inventoried. Other than insects, these small invertebrates are likely to represent a large proportion of the animal life in springs and other water sources. This survey will serve as an essential foundation for describing overall large-scale, biodiversity of these waters in the U.S. and Mexican Chihuahuan desert. The physical structure, seasonality, water chemistry, and aquatic vegetation of springs and temporary waters will be characterized. (B) The specific aims of this project test three hypotheses. (1) Are species found in the Chihuahuan Desert unique or cosmopolitan in their distribution? (2) Is seasonality and inter-annual variability important in defining overall community composition? (3) Are species distributions and genetic patterns related to historical geologic events or more recent dispersals and adaptations to extreme environments? This is an international collaboration that will provide an important contribution to understanding the diversity of freshwater species in the Chihuahuan Desert.<br/><br/>This project establishes joint work between U.S. and Mexican scientists. Training in taxonomy, ecology, and molecular techniques such as DNA sequencing will be given to graduate and undergraduate students in both countries. In addition, all institutions involved in this project attract a large percentage of women students into the sciences; moreover, the University of Texas at El Paso attracts a large number of minority students to both its undergraduate and graduate programs. Moreover, with use of the Internet, it creates a shared database for research and education worldwide. Finally, academic scientists will partner with federal and private agencies (e.g., BBNP, TX and NM state agencies, and WWF). The study will provide baseline data useful to state and federal agencies in formulating public policies on land and water use in Chihuahuan Desert environments.

The intellectual goal of the research is to address several questions related to this structure, including its size, extent along our line of sight, and the degree of spatial and kinematic symmetry relative to the plane. This information will be used to test models for the origin of this asymmetry, which may involve a triaxial thick disk, a gravitational interaction with the Galactic bar in the disk, or the fossil remnant of a galaxy merger. The research will have broad impact through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students, and by fostering close collaboration between a research extensive university, and two primarily undergraduate institutions.

SeaTech content focuses on understanding the acoustic behaviors of whales and dolphins, specifically, sound production, noise impacts and acoustic population census in California, the Bering Sea and the Southern Ocean. <br/><br/>SeaTech offers a two-year core program for 13 & 14 year olds consisting of a Breadth of Exposure phase and a Depth of Skills phase totaling 299 hours. The core program has three distinct elements -- after-school clubs, field explorations and summer research institutes -- and is augmented with efforts before and after: an Early Pipeline Development phase (52 hours) for youth age 12, and Internships (40 hours) for youth age 15. The three-year ITEST grant will host three cohorts of 40 participants each. Each youth participant will receive 391 total contact hours. Through efforts directed at parents, SeaTech anticipates involving 60 parents in about 80 hours of activities each year.<br/><br/>Coordinated through and with the expertise of Capistrano Valley B&GC, recruitment will include orientation and information programs, a bilingual brochure and direct efforts by B&GC staff. In addition, recruitment will happen from local schools.<br/><br/>INTELLECTUAL MERIT: IT-based studies of marine mammal bio-acoustics will 'hook' student interest in after-school clubs, field explorations and summer research institutes.

The SeaTech Club provides organizational structure to the teen activities at the B&GC; however, the IT curriculum is also integrated into two nationally renowned extant structures called Career Launch and Club Tech. Findings from the project's examination of recruitment, retention and parental involvement will have broad implications to the field of informal science education.
0508220	NER: Dynamic Nanomechanical Mapping of Living Cell Surface Receptors	EF	NANOSCALE: EXPLORATORY RSRCH	08/01/2005	07/28/2005	Krystyn VanVliet	MA	Massachusetts Institute of Technology	Standard Grant	Eve Ida Barak	07/31/2007	$160,000.00		krystyn@mit.edu	77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE	Cambridge	MA	021394301	6172531000	BIO	1676	1676, 9183, BIOT, 1114	$0.00	Living cells must communicate with each other and with their environment and respond appropriately. This communication is generally mediated by cell surface receptors (CSRs) which receive information in the form of signalling molecules that bind to the receptors (ligands)and respond to that infomation via a signal transduction cascade that leads to a cellular response. Thus, CSRs provide the physical/functional interface between the cell and its environment. It is known that cell phenotype and function are correlative with changes in the cell surface, including the dynamic expression and/or distribution of CSRs. However, the present capacity to track these potential targets and signals of cell function is limited by both biological complexity and a lack of experimental tools. In fact, there exists no current method to quantify this critical signature of cell state at the level of single cells within heterogeneous populations, as a function of real-time response to stimuli, and with molecular resolution. This constraint is illustrated by the increasingly frequent use of combinatorial approaches, high-throughput screening.to find cell types, biochemical factors, and synthetic substrata that result in the desired cell response. From a bioengineering perspective, there is much that could be done to benefit society (e.g., tissue and targeted drug delivery engineering) if we had the capacity to observe dynamic cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions in the context of CSR presence, distribution, and function. From a basic fundamental perspective, there are many important but as-yet-unanswerable questions about cell surface receptor organization and function and how these effect signal transduction mechanisms that could be addressed if we had the capacity to observe these things simultaneously, in real time, with molecular resolution. Dr. VanVliet suggests that such knowledge and the concurrent goal of engineered cell function will be enabled via biofunctionalized nanomechanical imaging of the CSR landscape on living cells. This approach, if successful, will enable unparalleled access to real-time changes in the molecular profile of living cell surfaces, as a function of systematic variation of genetic, biochemical and mechanical stimuli. Dr. VanVliet has previously demonstrated, via collaborative investigations of nanomechanical instabilities in inorganic crystals, that dynamic structural adaptations within materials can be measured, induced, and predicted via contact deformation of surfaces at atomistic/molecular length scales. In this Nanoscale Exploratory Research project, these powerful capabilities will be developed for dynamic living cell surfaces, in order to extend fundamental understanding of the CSR interface through quantitative, simultaneous structural and biochemical imaging via nanomechanical contact. <br/><br/>The objective is to capitalize on the potential of scanning probe microscopy and molecular force spectroscopy to develop a powerful new in vitro cell surface imaging approach through direct, reversible binding between a chemically functionalized mechanical probe and the living cell surface. This approach, termed functionalized force imaging (FFI), will quantify the real-time spatial and temporal distribution of CSRs and internal but near-surface cytoskeletal structure. FFI presents several distinct advantages over existing approaches for CSR analysis: This contact-based imaging does not require cleavage of the cell from its substratum, is not restricted to the analysis of proteins for which purified antibodies are available, and reveals the distribution and relative binding affinity of CSRs that can be tracked over time within individual cells. This project focuses on the development of two specific aspects critical to the feasibility of nanomechanical CSR mapping in living cells: (1) rapid, spatially biased acquisition of both intermolecular forces and structural/mechanical surface profiles; (2) validation of receptor binding specificity in a model cell system for which the number of CSRs per cell can be controlled and quantified through complementary experimental techniques. These objectives will enable the PI.s longer-term goals which include identifying mesenchymal stem and progenitor cell-specific CSR profiles, and then tracking and guiding the differentiation of these cells through external mechanical stimuli for applications ranging from tissue engineered vasculature to chemomechanical sensors. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the research will include a new, quantitatively rigorous experimental tool that will catalyze innovative, cross-disciplinary investigations of chemomechanical coupling in biological systems. This broader impact of this project includes a new laboratory-based course on nanomechanical biological experimentation that will be offered to undergraduates of MIT, Wellesley College, and Brandeis University, and that will be co-instructed by the graduate research assistant participating in the above research objectives. This proposal addresses the Biosystems at the Nanoscale research and education theme of the NSF NES solicitation.

These studies are focused on two genes (APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI)) that control the identity of the floral organs in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  In ap3 and pi mutants, sepals develop in place of petals, and carpels develop in place of stamens.  Both AP3 and PI encode DNA binding proteins that are postulated to function together as a heterodimer.  Several lines of evidence suggest that AP3 and PI are components of a larger protein complex that is involved in specifying the identity of petals and stamens.  The goal of this research is to identify and characterize these additional components.  Two lines of investigation will be pursued.  First, the AP3/PI protein complex will be purified from floral extracts, and the components of the complex will be biochemically characterized.  Second, several novel genes identified in a genetic screen for PI modifiers will be cloned and characterized.  The proposed studies will have a number of broader impacts.  First, teaching and training of graduate students and undergraduate students will be promoted.  Two to three graduate students and four to six undergraduate students will participate in this project.  Second, these studies will enhance scientific understanding that will ultimately benefit society.  AP3 and PI are important for proper development of flowers.  Since flowers are the source of seeds and fruit, a detailed understanding of flower development has important implications for agricultural productivity and the quality of agricultural products.

In many cases, the underlying mathematical optimization problem is provably hard, and cannot be solved to optimality in a reasonable amount of time. As a result, the task of the algorithm designer is to develop algorithms that are efficient and provide good solutions on every single run, as a far from optimum solution even just once might be catastrophic, either in terms of the cost of the solution obtained or in terms of its inability to meet demands or other constraints. This stresses the importance of designing efficient algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization problems that deliver solutions guaranteed to be probably close to the optimum. This area of approximation algorithms has seen a tremendous growth in the last decade, with a host of new results. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal is to develop new methodologies and techniques to provide the algorithm designer with the tools to design approximation algorithms and is also to focus on crucial problems. These problems include fundamental problems such as the traveling salesman problem and other network problems which arise as building blocks in many industrial settings. A special emphasis will be given to settings in which the data evolves over time and the algorithm's task is to provide a constantly changing solution to meet the fluctuating requirements. This solution needs to be robust against these fluctuations, and remain close to optimum at any time.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this proposal is to provide industry with the tools to be<br/>more productive and more efficiently use the available resources, and this in turn will have an impact on the economy. The proposal also seeks funds for the training of graduate students and this is important to maintain the competitively of our workforce and guarantee the best possible training for the next generation of faculty members teaching on our college campuses.

The approach will be to synthesize by ion implantation a range of semiconductor quantum dots implanted into infrared transparent substrates. Spectral response will be tailored by varying the quantum dot size. Resulting size, structure, distribution and chemistry will be quantified by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Fine-tuning about a particular spectral peak will then be performed by the application of strain accomplished by piezoactuator loading. <br/><br/>If successful the benefits of this research will be a new class of advanced infrared sensors with dramatically improved performance in multispectral and high sensitivity applications, including remote temperature sensing, trace gas sensing of chemical and biological species, military target discrimination and identification, and ground-based astronomy. The ability to actively tune the absorption spectra of quantum dots could lead to compact infrared sensors with lower cost, higher sensitivity and the ability to operate at room temperature. Additionally this work will contribute to an enhancement of infrastructure for research and education by the strong collaboration which reaches across both institutional and interdisciplinary bounds. Interaction with the scientists and engineers from the participating government laboratory will broaden the scientific experience of our graduate and undergraduate students involved with the project, and will promote understanding and awareness of interdisciplinary scientific collaboration.

The research involves a combination of experimental studies, led by Prof. Sobel of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, the chlorite-iodide-malonic acid (CIMA) reaction and other related reactions to search for general principles for classifying chemical reactions in terms of their ability to support excitability. Reduced models are being derived and theoretical studies based on combining approaches involving Langevin equations, Master equations and molecular dynamics simulations are being carried out by Prof. Hastings. These theoretical and computational studies will help to elucidate the role of phenomena at different length and organizational scales in these nonlinear phenomena. One specific question being addressed by this research is the role of microscopic fluctuations and heterogeneities in giving rise to excitability. In particular, the role of chemical amplification of these fluctuations is being studied. The work is having a broad impact on the understanding of nonlinear phenomena, in general, and on the understanding of cardiac disease, particularly ventricular fibrillation. The work involves a collaborator, Prof. Richard Field of the University of Montana, and is incorporating both undergraduates and high school students as participants in the research. The PIs will distribute the resulting computer codes via their website.

Such nanoparticle properties as size, mass or density, and the binding energy of a particle to the substrate are targetedparameters for measurements. An acoustic shear wave is generated by solid-state transducers, which provide a non-contact mean of delivering a mechanical force to the particle. This force, which extends from the transducer substrate into ambient air on the order on tens to hundreds of nanometers, excites a particle into a resonant motion. From the analysis of that resonant motion one can infer the above listed characteristic parameters of the particle. Specifically, several carefully designed experimental and theoretical efforts are proposed to study physical mechanisms of operation of an Acoustic Wave Nanoparticle Analyzer (AWNA).<br/><br/>Employed methods: The work proposed falls into three broad activities: device development, theoretical modeling and the concept validation. These three areas are not mutually exclusive and will proceed simultaneously. Device development includes design, fabrication and testing of the very high frequency shear wave transducers, electronics and software for efficient generation of mechanical interfacial forces. Theoretical models describing an interaction of a particle with the surface of a transducer will incorporate the Nanoscale complexity of the system and the multiple length scales of the systems to be studied. These developments will be validated using different models in which various aspects created by particle size and interfacial forces will be examined in carefully controlled or simulated experimental conditions. Finally, the measured acoustical responses will be correlated with standard optical (micron-size particles) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) techniques.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity: Since many of the properties of nanometer-sized particles and features are not predictable from observation at a larger scale, the published work on the interaction of acoustic waves with macroscopic objects and our own preliminary data on micrometer sized particles cannot reliably suggest that same phenomena will be observed for nanoparticles. In addition, there are substantial theoretical difficulties because the reduced (finite) size of the nanostructural components, which is intermediate between the condensed-phase and molecular regimes, makes both continuum models and atomic model inapplicable directly to the nanoparticles. These challenges highlight the exploratory nature of this project. The acoustic shear wave nanoparticle analysis technique, once developed, will be complementary to current micro-and nano-particle techniques for nanoparticle separation, such as AFM or SEM. In particular, this technique will provide an efficient method for characterization of nanoparticles according to their size, shape or interaction properties. The acoustic shear wave analysis technique will be effective on nanoparticles regardless of their optical, electrical and magnetic properties, and thus can be used in various environments and in different media. These unique features of the acoustic nanoparticle analyzer will significantly impact the fields of characterization and application of nanoparticles. The long-term objective of this research is to develop an AWNA chip capable of autonomous and programmable analysis of nanoparticles in gases and liquids. AWNA chip will provide an experimental platform for analysis, design and monitoring of various biochemical and biophysical processes involving inorganic nanoparticles as well biological objects such as proteins or cells.<br/><br/>The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity: Analysis of nanoparticles, in addition to its technological importance, brings an effective tool for teaching and publicizing nanotechnology. The proposed research and educational efforts will impact many areas and specifically, it will: (i) expand the knowledge on interfacial phenomena at the nanoscale level, (ii) provide a new research tool for analysis of nanoparticles, as well a new tool for nanofabrication processes, (iii) enhance awareness of nanotechnology by the public, (iv) enhance nanotechnology-oriented curricula by providing cost-effective instrumentation for laboratory experimentation, (v) attract more students to the area of nanotechnology (vi) due to its potential visual appeal (seeing moving particles), it will capture the imaginations of high school students, including those with limited interest in science (females and underrepresented ethnic groups), and as a result will attract more students to science and engineering, (vii) enhance collaborations among scientists in physics, biology, chemistry and engineering.<br/><br/>The category of the proposal in the NER program is Nanoscale devices and system architecture.

Giant astronomical surveys will soon monitor much of the sky regularly, detecting vast numbers of interesting, variable astronomical objects. These objects will range from small solar system bodies to distant quasars; in the middle of the range of scales the surveys will find planets around other stars when they transit (pass in front of) their parent stars. The objective of this proposal is to get ready for this new treasure trove. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project is: (1) developing new, scalable techniques to identify extra-solar planets in synoptic survey data, and (2) preserving novelty detection when the volume of data becomes so large that the scientists are removed from the data. The goal is to discover new extra-solar planets.<br/><br/>The outcome of this project will be new techniques for mining these extremely massive databases, and a preliminary survey for candidate planets. This will enable follow-up work to scour new data as they become available. The datamining tools will have impact that extends beyond the needs of astronomy. The screening of time-series data for interesting events occurs in many arenas, ranging from national defense to the tracking of commercial transactions.

They are caused primarily by intense and rapidly varying ionospheric currents that can be hazardous to technological systems on the surface of the Earth. Sudden impulse (SI) events caused by the passage of interplanetary shocks have been shown to produce magnetic variations on the ground large and fast enough to cause large GICs. The aim of this project is to develop empirical and physics-based models of the ionospheric portion of the SI current system and use these models to calculate, and ultimately predict, the geomagnetically induced fields at the surface of the Earth. The study will be accomplished by developing an empirical model of the SI currents using measurements from ground-based magnetometers combined with radar measurements of the ionospheric plasma drift. Also, a physics-based model of the SI currents system will be developed using a global magnetospheric model and upstream solar wind measurements to evaluate its ability to represent the current system.   The induced magnetic and electric fields from these model current system will be calculated using the numerical techniques known as the method of auxiliary sources, the complex image method, and by utilizing the magnetotelluric equations and a model of the Earth's conductivity. The result of the project will be a predictive model, based on the upstream solar wind conditions, that will forecast the size, location, and duration of geomagnetically induced fields produced by SI events. In addition, techniques that combine magnetometer and radar data will be developed. This research has important scientific relevance becaue large GICs are known to cause severe effects on electric power grids, sometimes resulting in socioeconomic losses that can exceed tens of millions of dollars. The research will involve both undergraduate and graduate students in the engineering and physics departments.

The basic research aspect of the meeting is high-lighted by presentations on subjects such as ecophysiology, microbial diversity, symbiosis, metabolic networks, aquatic viruses, and metagenomics. The more applied lectures cover subjects such as sustainable biotechnology, renewable fuels, biofilms, and new methods of cultivation. In many sessions basic research and applications talks are back to back to stimulate this exchange. Speakers have been asked to present only state of the art new material, to leave ample time for discussion, and to challenge the audience with new ideas. With regard to the broader impacts, the bringing together of researchers in the GRC format will introduce two communities of scholars to each other, and add a mixture of students and postdocs to the list. The participation of students and postdocs is being specifically targeted with this goal in mind.
0517740	RUI: Contractile Roots: Their Role in Anchorage and Resource Acquisition in the Agavaceae	IOS	ENVIRON & STRUCTURAL SYS CL	08/01/2005	07/07/2005	Gretchen North	CA	Occidental College	Standard Grant	William E. Zamer	07/31/2010	$157,175.00		gnorth@oxy.edu	1600 Campus Road	Los Angeles	CA	900413314	3232591414	BIO	7474	9183, 9229, BIOT	$0.00	The purpose of this study is to investigate how root contraction (longitudinal shortening) can help plant root systems perform two primary functions: anchorage and resource acquisition. Contractile roots have been studied previously as a means of pulling a plant to a more favorable soil depth or helping establish an offshoot at some distance from its parent plant. Although the process of contraction has been investigated for a number of species, the effects of the associated anatomical modifications on root water uptake have not been examined. Contractile roots, which have been described previously for one member of the genus Agave, appear to be widespread in the family Agavaceae, which includes several species of ecological importance in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico. The guiding hypothesis of this study is that contractile roots not only improve seedling establishment and clonal propagation in seasonally dry habitats but also enhance water uptake in regions of infrequent and limited rainfall. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the structure and function of contractile roots for paired species in the Agavaceae that differ in habitat (e.g., grassland vs. desert), growth habit (e.g., succulent vs. non-succulent, rosette vs. tree-like), and method of reproduction (e.g., frequently vegetative vs. strictly sexual). The amount of root contraction and shoot displacement will be quantified under various conditions in the laboratory and in a common garden, and root systems of native species of agave and yucca in southern California will be partially excavated to determine the extent of root contraction in the field. Water uptake by contractile versus non-contractile roots will be investigated along with anatomical features such as microtubule orientation, cell shape and size, cell vitality, and cell wall modifications, particularly as they affect water absorption and transport. The study will encompass several scales (organelle to plant family) and employ techniques from several fields (anatomy, ecology, and physiology), providing multiple yet integrated options for undergraduate learning and preparation for future research. Due to the reputation of Occidental College as an institution committed to diversity and its location in northeast Los Angeles, the opportunity for under-represented students to become involved in the research is great. In addition, the study promises to illuminate the functional significance of contractile roots in an ecologically and economically important group of plants and to examine for the first time the effects of contraction on the ability of roots to acquire and transport water.

David L. Wild and Matthew J. Beal, of the Keck Graduate Institute in Claremont, California and the State University of New York in Buffalo, New York, respectively, are proposing to build statistical models of time series data, with a view to leveraging sophisticated Bayesian methods to reverse-engineer an organism's complex genetic regulatory networks from the raw measurements of gene expression and metabolite concentration.<br/><br/>Drs. Wild and Beal will apply their techniques to an ideal experimental system: the response of the bacterium E coli to acid stress, which enables pathogenic E. coli to survive passage through the acidic environment of the stomach and gastro-intestinal tract. They will collaborate with experimentalists Drs. Francesco Falciani and Mark Viant at the University of Birmingham, UK, who will provide data from both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of this bacterium. Predictions made by Wild and Beal's models can then be tested and explored back in the laboratory.<br/><br/>Recent advances in functional genomics technologies have given biologists unprecedented access to measurements of the inner workings of complex biological organisms. Using microarray expression profiling, it is now possible to measure the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes in just a single biological experiment, conducted over several days in the form of a time series. Contrast this to the situation only ten years ago when it was rather unusual for a biologist to measure the expression of more than just one or two carefully chosen genes. As well as high-throughput gene expression methods, the new technology of metabolomics has opened the door to measuring even more information in the form of the concentration of hundreds of metabolites that are also crucial players in the complex cellular processes under study.<br/><br/>This overwhelming amount of data challenges traditional methods of analysis, especially when one considers the element of time, because now one must consider how certain genes regulate the expression of other genes from one time point in the experiment to the next. <br/><br/>A key ingredient in Drs. Wild and Beal's models is the inclusion of hidden factors that help to explain the correlation structure of the observed measurements. These factors may correspond to unmeasured quantities that were not captured during the experiment and often reduce the number of direct gene-to-gene dependencies, leaving the resulting networks much more interpretable for the biologist. A natural question arises: how many hidden factors should be used to account for the dependencies in the observed data? This is answered by employing Bayesian model selection, a well-founded principle used in machine learning and statistics to choose between models of differing complexities. Their models also use a technique called Automatic Relevance Determination to further simplify the models so that only those genes and metabolites that are participating players in the process are retained in the final model.<br/><br/>Another advantage of the Bayesian framework is that existing information about known network connections and interactions, derived from the literature or commercial databases, can be included in the model. The output of the modeling procedure is a probabilistic reckoning of which genetic regulatory networks are plausible or not. These probabilities can be used to design future biological experiments targeted at specific genes, with a view to corroborating the model's in silico predictions or to simply probe a relatively uncharted network.

The approach is to develop models, based on both a fundamental understanding of material behavior and designed experiments, which describe how ultrasonic energy enables the embedding of fibers within a metal matrix and the mechanical properties of the resulting fiber-reinforced metal matrix structures.<br/><br/>The ability to more cost-effectively design and fabricate MMCs will significantly impact many industries, including transportation, communication and defense. Thus, the successful completion of this research could have broad societal impact. In addition, as the research progresses, the results will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate learning at Utah State University, and special attention will be given to opportunities to attract and retain underrepresented students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

Understanding the<br/>distribution and properties of these stars is important for understanding Galactic chemical evolution,<br/>as well as for constraining the dynamics of supernova explosions and for illuminating the formation<br/>and life-cycles of various type of exotic compact binary systems.<br/>The most direct constraints on the neutron star distribution come from measurements of parallaxes<br/>and proper motions. In most cases, these measurements can be made only for the subclass of<br/>neutron stars that are luminous at radio wavelengths: the radio pulsars. Even then, the closest radio<br/>pulsars are a hundred times the distance of the closest stars, and the effects of parallax and proper<br/>motion are correspondingly smaller. Only about 1% of pulsars have measured parallaxes and only<br/>about 10% of pulsars have even crudely measured proper motions.<br/>Here, Thorsett and Dewey will continue their highly successful interferometry program, using the<br/>Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array to make very precise astrometric<br/>measurements of a large sample of pulsars and address several important questions. The<br/>investigation will, over the next three years, measure the birth velocity distribution of neutron stars<br/>with sufficient accuracy to constrain both the high and low velocity tails (needed to understand<br/>supernova asymmetries and retention of neutron stars in globular clusters, respectively), and will<br/>improve understanding of local pulsar distances and the local pulsar birthrate. This plan is based<br/>primarily on observations that are either underway or already approved.<br/>The investigations will include student training and support, with project data forming the basis of a<br/>Ph.D. thesis. The student and the principle investigators will also maintain formal connections and<br/>participate in activities with the Exploratorium science museum and the COSMOS summer<br/>program. Co-investigator Dewey is also Education and Public Outreach Director for the UCSC<br/>branch of Calspace, providing further outreach opportunities.<br/>External science investigations will also be enabled by both web and traditional publication of the<br/>data gathered here. These include identification of the primary target lists for The Gamma-ray Large<br/>Area Space Telescope and other satellite missions, and interpretation of multiwavelength pulsar<br/>emission data. Comparison of the local pulsar birthrate to the massive star birthrate, constrains the<br/>properties of the progenitors of Type II supernovae. Pulsar velocity measurements not only<br/>constrain models of their birth events, and are important input parameters to population synthesis<br/>studies of binary systems. The observations made to identify calibration sources for the Very Long<br/>Baseline Array surveys comprise a large survey sample of 21-cm snapshots of extragalactic sources.

Lipid bilayers and biomolecules will be assembled on aerogel supports to form biomembranes of various functionalities. The aerogel substrate confers an advantage over other support structures since each component of the synthetic membrane has access to biologically active materials as in a living cell membrane. The three areas of investigation are: synthesis of aerogel surface with tailored chemistry and structure, creation of synthetic cell membrane-like lipid nano-assemblies, and multi-scale computational modeling of the interaction of the membranes with biologically active molecules. Communication between investigators and inclusion of diverse underrepresented groups will be strongly emphasized.
0501764	Partnerships in Educational Resources for Renewable Energy Technologies	DUE	ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG	08/01/2005	08/30/2008	Barbara Anderegg	WI	Madison Area Technical College	Standard Grant	Duncan E. McBride	07/31/2009	$500,000.00	William Johnson, Joy McMillan	banderegg@matcmadison.edu	1701 Wright Street	Madison	WI	537042599	6082466676	EHR	7412	1032, 9178, SMET	$0.00	The project is increasing the expertise of qualified renewable energy technicians in existing 2-year college and high school programs through a collaborative infrastructure for delivering an online series of renewable energy courses developed and taught by top experts in the field. This series, which can be easily integrated into existing 2-year college programs, includes introductory renewable energy, energy management, alternative transportation, photovoltaic, solar home design, wind power, and biomass courses. Until the North American Board of Energy Practitioners and other industry-sanctioned accrediting agencies can certify these courses, the College is issuing certificates for them. The project includes industry and renewable energy association experts to develop a review process and a stamp of approval that will be noted on the certificate.<br/><br/>To complement the online courses, the project is developing a series of web-based learning objects that give learners virtual access to renewable energy technologies and inquiry-based pedagogy. The project plans to conduct one large summer institute to introduce and promote the online courses and the learning objects to other faculty. Finally, it is developing an alternative to the online courses through a similar series of face-to-face renewable energy workshops offered at the College that will serve as a model that other schools and technical college systems can adopt. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/>This project addresses a major challenge in undergraduate education, namely, how do two-year college programs change to reflect new and emerging technologies, in this case, renewable energy technologies? The project uses a simple, but practical model that makes a prestigious group of experts from around the country and virtual laboratory experiences available to everyone. It provides the infrastructure and the vision to bring emerging and disparate renewable energy technologies together into a cohesive structure that two-year colleges can readily embrace. The model also includes a provision to bring seasoned renewable energy teachers into the 2-year college classroom immediately. Finally, it includes cutting-edge pedagogy through learner-centered, interactive learning objects. <br/><br/>Broad Impact <br/>This project empowers faculty and institutions to take advantage of the rapidly developing interdisciplinary technologies that can revitalize educational programs and create new ones. As such, it is a powerful model of the two-year college as an agent of change to meet emerging economic and workforce development needs. A key feature of this model is the evolution of existing 2-year college programs to provide new pathways for renewable energy technicians. The courses and the learning objects provide access to experts in the field using innovative, learner-centered strategies. These strategies provide a flexible way to stay abreast of new developments as they are easily scaled up or down for new technologies.

Strain and corrosion sensors are designed using a new nano-composite comprised of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) and polyelectrolyte (PE) molecules. The natural piezoresistive properties of SWNT-polyelectrolyte thin films render them ideal for strain sensing. SWNT-PE strain sensors would be characterized by excellent linearity and long-term stability as compared to traditional metal foil gauges. This project will also explore the use of SWNT-PE thin films for corrosion sensing. With the surfaces of SWNT and polyelectrolyte molecules chemically modified to provide reactive surfaces, the binding of chloride ions and other corrosive elements will induce changes in the film bulk conductivity. Such thin films would offer reliable measures of the concentration of corrosive elements within cementitious structural elements. The thin film sensors will be patterned as inductive elements that can be read wirelessly through electromagnetic coupling. This work stands to have far reaching broad impacts including: rapid transfer of sensor technology into industrial practice, integration of research findings with current curricula, and recruitment of underrepresented students through interaction with the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) and the Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program (DAPCEP) programs. <br/><br/>This is a project supported under FY05 Sensors Initiative NSF 05-526.

A promising new approach for addressing some of these problems is provided by library generators. Although all library generators have much in common, there is currently little code reuse in their implementation. This project will develop an infrastructure, called Proteus to generate highly optimized libraries for four important problem domains: dense linear algebra, sorting, data mining, and network packet processing. The platforms of interst for these environments include sequential processors with deep memory hierarchies, multi-core systems that provide small-scale shared-memory parallelism, and custom network processors.<br/><br/>Research advances on several fronts are required to make Proteus a reality: a simple domain language for linear algebra in the proposal and appropriate DSL's for data mining and network packet processing. Once domain-specific optimizations are done, the programs will be translated into a lower-level language called the X language, to be developed under the project,  that will represent in a compact way the search space as well as the strategy for adapting the code to the hardware. Proteus will contain tools for gathering information about the target machine, for guiding the selection process either statically or dynamically, for implementing domain-independent optimizations of the X code, and for generating C code as the final output.<br/><br/>The Proteus infrastructure will enable rapid prototyping of library generators for different domains. The libraries that will beproduced in the four different domains will be useful and interesting in their own right. In addition,  tools will be developed for gathering information about the target machines and the computing environment, can be used by themselves in other projects.<br/>

In the area of discrete time control, we will study and analyze convex-valued dynamical systems, similar to the ones used for the analysis of the mathematical models of economic growth and we will use these results in analysis of complex discrete time financial market models. In the second part of our research, we will study new applications of the optimal control of diffusion processes to optimization models in finance and insurance. We will investigate mixed regular-singular stochastic and impulse stochastic control appropriate for those problems. We also intend to study the class of nonlinear partial differential (or integral-differential) equations with gradient constraints that form an appropriate analytical framework for these models.<br/><br/>The importance of these activities is in the development of new methodology of applications of stochastic control in mathematical finance and insurance. Successful completion of the research objectives will increase our understanding of the structure of the policy the financial and insurance optimization models and will allow one to get a better insight into the nature of the optimal dividend distribution policy to which a publicly traded financial corporation should adhere. More importantly, it will provide understanding of the risk control policy such an institution should follow.

The problem area is of critical national and scientific importance, since modern engineered systems deployed for many critical applications are comprised of multiple agents who need to coordinate their actions to achieve a control objective in an uncertain environment. Such systems are used for many applications, including surveillance, environmental monitoring, inventory control, and control in hazardous environments, among many others, in fields such as transportation, medical diagnostics, civil engineering, communications networks, and defense systems.<br/><br/>The main scientific ideas being developed are (1) a new technique to tame the complexity of controlling multi-agent systems by a focus on aggregate behavior, i.e. not so much on which agent carries out a given action as on how many agents carry out a given action, and (2) a new technique to based on the use of common randomness between the agents to increase their ability to hedge against uncertainty in the environment.<br/>The aggregation techniques to tame complexity that are being developed rely on mean-field methods, which have proven well-suited to exposing phase transitions in physical systems, but have so far not been systematically used for control. The phenomenon of symmetry breaking, which occurs when different portions of a homogeneous system must use different control rules to obtain optimal system wide performance, is of particular interest. The techniques to hedge against uncertainty that are being developed rely on game-theoretic models, as well as methods to extract common randomness from ambient noise and the randomized choices of other agents.

Unfortunately, mobile networks are not equipped to provide the high-speed access that Internet users expect due to fundamental problems associated with wireless communication: scarce bandwidth and poor quality. To overcome these problems, this research develops a family of algorithms that allow the transmitter to respond to changes in the propagation channel. The major innovation in this work is the development of new methods for compressing information about the propagation channel. This information is sent from the receiver back to the transmitter to help the transmitter adjust the transmitted signal. <br/><br/>The approach to this research is to develop a framework for source coding with a new source: the wireless channel. This differs from traditional source coding in that the objective is to improve communication theoretic system performance as opposed to improving the fidelity of the reconstruction. The objectives of the research are to determine what channel state information should be quantized; develop algorithms for quantizing the essential parameters of the channel; derive suitable communication theoretic notions of fidelity of the quantization such as mutual information and bit error rate; characterize the tradeoff between feedback rate and network performance; and confront practical issues introduced by estimation error, errors and delay in the feedback channel, and implementation constraints.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the work are expected in diverse areas including research in the form of new algorithms, theoretical results, and insights; industry through mobile network applications developed by industry partners; and education through better trained engineers, research experiences for minority students, mentoring, and enhanced learning worldwide thanks to publicly available courseware.

This project will use the experimental test set-up of NSF NEESR award CMS-0420347 entitled NEESR-SG: Seismic Performance of Bridge Systems with Conventional and Innovative Materials. Results from this payload project will be archived in the NEES data repository maintained by NEES Consortium, Inc. (www.nees.org). <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Shape memory alloys are a class of unique alloys that have the ability to undergo large displacements and revert back to their original undeformed configuration via a martensitic transformation. Previous work by the Principal Investigator has focused on the optimization of the properties of the alloys such that they can be used in seismic applications. This has led to the development of ideal properties for both wire and large bars and the development and testing of component dampers and recentering devices. These studies were the first to show idealized flag-shaped superelastic properties in both large bars and wire. This NEESR payload project will use the multi-span bridge test set-up at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), NEES equipment site under NSF NEESR award CMS-0420347 to design, develop, and test innovative SMA devices on the bridge structure to validate the results of previous component testing and analytical studies. Three sets of devices will be tested: bundled SMA wire, optimized SMA bars, and SMA-based composites. The experimental tests will be coupled with analytical studies using OpenSees to determine the optimal properties of the devices to limit superstructure displacement and demands on columns and relative displacement at the abutment. Additional analytical studies will include the development of detailed models for SMAs. Several types of SMA elements will be developed and provided in the OpenSees element library. The results of the analytical models of the bridge will be used to develop bridge fragility curves to illustrate the viability of these innovative retrofit measures in a probabilistic framework and allow for comparison of the reduction in vulnerability of the bridge system with SMA recentering devices with other traditional retrofit measures. Using an instructional shake table located at Georgia Tech, a small-scale model of the test set-up will first be developed to evaluate concepts that will then be applied on the UNR bridge structure. Small SMA wires (0.08 diameter) will be used for the small-scale experiment.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will leverage resources from an existing AGEP program at Georgia Tech to target and fund underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in all aspects of the research program, including the small-scale study, large-scale study, and analysis. The broader impact of the research is that the use of the promising, new SMA technology will be validated, which would significantly improve the performance of bridges during earthquakes, resulting in the potential reduction in casualties and economic losses from earthquakes. Furthermore, the knowledge gained by this project will provide the foundation for the use of smart materials in other structural systems.

Dixie Highway Suite 650	CORAL GABLES	FL	331462926	3052843924	MPS	7334	0000, OTHR	$0.00	The goal of the research is to gain a better theoretical understanding of how the patterns of movement of organisms interact with the structure of the landscape through which they move and thereby influence the persistence and interactions of species and the composition of ecological communities. To do that the investigators will develop and analyze mathematical models for the population dynamics of dispersing organisms. The models will be generalizations of reaction-diffusion systems that will incorporate features not usually present in ecological models based on those systems. Standard reaction-diffusion models in ecology describe populations inhabiting a single uniform environment and assume that dispersal is purely random and is not conditional on properties of the environment or the presence of other organisms. The models that the investigators will study will describe dispersal that depends on environmental conditions, occurs in patchy landscapes, and/or is variable in time. To capture those features the models will incorporate mechanisms and structures such as density-dependent diffusion and boundary conditions, advection along environmental gradients, boundary conditions that change over time, spatially varying coefficients, and multiple patches linked by long distance dispersal. The motivation for incorporating such features is to obtain more realistic descriptions of the ways in which populations can be affected by modifications of the environment such as habitat fragmentation and the effects of global change. To analyze the models the investigators will use methods from ordinary and partial differential equations, dynamical systems, and nonlinear functional analysis. Some of the modeling assumptions will lead to models with novel features that will require the development of new mathematical ideas and methods. <br/><br/>The objective of the project is to create and apply mathematical models that describe how the movement patterns of organisms affect how their populations grow or decline and how they interact with other organisms. The models will be based on equations which incorporate factors such as movement rates that involve responses to features of the landscape such as edges between habitat types or are influenced by the presence of other organisms. Those features are not generally present in existing spatial models in ecology. The models will describe populations inhabiting patchy environments consisting of mixtures of different habitat types. Such environments often result from human activities such as urbanization, agriculture, and the creation of nature reserves. Investigating how spatial effects can threaten or help maintain biodiversity or affect interactions between important types of organisms such as crops, pests, and biological control agents may provide insights that will lead to improved decision making in areas such as conservation, land management, pest and disease control, and urban planning.

Recent evidence suggests that glia may play an important role in regulating the extracellular concentrations of neurotransmitters, potassium ions and hydrogen ions (protons). Acidosis (elevation of proton levels) can occur when respiratory activity is low. Acidosis stimulates neural cells within the brainstem that respond to elevated CO2 concentrations. The changes in neuronal electrical activity of these cells are determined in part by the extracellular pH (acid levels). Therefore, factors that influence pH in or around these chemosensitive cells may affect ventilatory responsiveness to acidic stimuli. <br/><br/>The proposed work is anticipated to yield the following important findings: 1) identify pH regulating mechanisms present in brainstem glia; 2) determine the extent to which extracellular pH (pHo) regulation depends on the activation of proton transport in glia; and 3) examine how selective blocking of glial pH regulation can affect pHo and, in turn, affect pHi (the pH within the cells) and the chemosensory stimulus in CO2-sensitive brainstem neurons. <br/><br/>Undergraduate students participating in the proposed research will be fully immersed in all aspects of experimental design, data collection, analysis and interpretation thereby providing opportunities for the students to explore their own ingenuity and creativity within the context of a scientifically relevant problem. One of the primary goals of this faculty-initiated, student-driven research is to establish a mentoring partnership between the student and faculty member that fosters the student's understanding of the process of scientific inquiry and the refinement of scientific questions through experimentation. The students will gain a clear understanding of the process of doing science and consequently hone many life skills (e.g. critical thinking, oral, visual and written communication) that will serve them well throughout their careers.

While the precise causes of these epidemics are unclear, they are likely to be influenced by human-induced environmental changes affecting both exposure and susceptibility of amphibians to pathogens. Temperature-dependent immunity may be particularly important to disease dynamics in amphibians, leading to increased susceptibility to infection in springtime or under changing climatic conditions. This project uses the Red-spotted newt, a common temperate salamander, as a model species for studying: (1) seasonality in infection and immunity in amphibians, (2) factors leading to outbreaks of an Ichthyophonus-like fungus implicated in recent amphibian die-offs, and (3) ecological processes structuring the newt parasite community. Capture-mark-recapture methods coupled with lab and field experiments will be used to test hypotheses which explain patterns observed in spatial and seasonal surveys of newt populations and their parasites. This research will provide insights into the effects of seasonal temperature fluctuations on amphibian immune defenses, the transmission dynamics of an important fungal pathogen, and the community ecology of amphibian parasites. Studying multiple immune parameters and parasite species in newts will lead to a broader impact on our understanding of how human-induced environmental changes affect disease dynamics in amphibian populations, by providing insight into general principles of amphibian disease ecology. This project will support the dissertation research of a doctoral candidate.

What exactly causes explosive volcanism will not be fully understood until the fundamentals of degassing are known in all magma compositions that erupt explosively. At this point, only two experimental studies of H2O bubble nucleation and growth exist in non-rhyolite melts. More experiments are needed to understand how the bubble nucleation and growth processes change as a function of melt composition. This project will use experiments on natural samples of the 79 AD Vesuvius phonolite to measure: 1) Critical H2O super-saturation needed for homogeneous and heterogeneous bubble nucleation. 2) The amount of excess (disequilibrium) H2O retained in the melt as a function of decompression rate and path. 3) Bubble growth rates as a function of melt temperature, composition, and crystal contents. The results will be used as input for dynamical models focusing specifically on the 79 AD eruption, and on vesiculation and eruption dynamics of alkalic magmas in general. One goal is to compare phonolite eruption processes with calc-alkaline rhyolites and dacites at a range of modeled ascent rates. <br/><br/>This work will help provide a better understanding of the degassing process in K phonolite melts that are prevalent at very dangerous and heavily populated volcanoes, such as Vesuvius in Italy. It will also provide insight into whether the build-up of extreme melt super-saturation during magmatic ascent is reasonable to explain the eruption dynamics of alkalic magmas, as has been suggested for rhyolites. Data from this research will be made available to other researchers interested in phonolite magmas at Vesuvius and other alkalic systems, and will provide experimental constraints to be used in interpreting vesicle textures in pumices. The results will be broadly disseminated in publications and meeting presentations. The publications will focus not only on the experiments, but also on eruption dynamical models, and comparisons with the 79 AD pumice textures. This award will provide an avenue for new collaborations between the PI and Italian researchers and the theoretical modeling community.

The genome and the proteome together establish an intricate network of interactions that exhibits many similarities to social and political networks. This interaction network forms a simple, conceptual representation of the molecular machinery in the living cell. Knowledge of individual interactions and patterns of interaction therefore significantly enhances our understanding of the mechanisms of biological function. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, experimental determination of molecular interactions at the scale of the entire genome is often error-prone: many interactions revealed by such high-throughput experiments are false, and conversely, many of the actual interactions are not revealed at all. It is important, therefore, to establish rigorous computational methods that utilize high-throughput data from a variety of sources to predict the existence (and lack thereof) of an interaction, and to assign confidence levels to each prediction in a systematic manner. Our project utilizes state-of-the-art predictive methods from the field of Artificial Intelligence-Bayesian support vector machines-to predict molecular interactions at the whole-genome level. The project is initiated by an exhaustive data collection effort involving a variety of data sources that supply putative predictors for the presence or absence of interactions among protein/protein or gene/protein pairs. Dominant predictors among these will be isolated, and the prediction system will be applied to the genomes of several organisms, including the budding yeast, worm, and fly. The accuracy of the method will be tested and refined by computational and biological means. Successful completion of this project will significantly enhance our ability to decipher genomic information and apply these findings to discover novel functional pathways of biological, agricultural, and medical importance. <br/><br/>All methods and results will be publicly disseminated, the former with stand-alone executable programs, and the latter via publications and web pages. The project will support interdisciplinary training of graduate and postdoctoral students, and should provide research opportunities for undergraduate students.

This innovative composite material concept is bio-based and hence environmentally friendly. The APNFC has excellent vibration and noise mitigation properties and can be used to control acoustic noise and structural vibrations in a wide variety of noisy environments. The unique design of this composite material will reduce noise transmission over a broad band of frequencies through a combination of absorption and dissipation phenomena. The prototype to be built during Phase II will consist of a thermoformed sandwiched material configuration where a polymer-based piezoelectric layer (PVdF) is formed between two passive layers composed of variable density natural fiber composite (VDNFC). This material will have an embedded control system with amplifiers and power supplies.<br/><br/>The commercial applications of the new technology include: home appliances, soundproof architectural doors, office furniture, operator cabins for agricultural and construction machinery, building materials, automobiles, and aircraft cabins. Collectively, these represent a multi-billion dollar market for parts and products to which the present core technology can be applied. The company has a focus commercialization plan with strategic partner support in the appliance application and the office and construction applications

The project applies biological processes and molecular genetic techniques to a practical engineering problem: the fabrication of a molecular-scale electronic device, with precise dimensions and predictable and reproducible performance, in a way that can be scaled to billions or trillions of integrated devices, at a low cost. The geometrically increasing number and performance of transistors on integrated circuits, driven by scaling of devices to smaller dimensions, can only be continued with new technologies that sidestep fundamental limits imposed by current manufacturing techniques relying on photographic pattern transfer. The proposed new technology harnesses self-assembly techniques, evolved by nature, to fabricate electronic switches. Also, methods will be developed to use cytoskeletal templates to fabricate conducting microtubules, useful for contacting this and other molecular electronic devices. This work addresses a vexing problem in interfacing the world of molecular devices, at the nanometer scale, to the micron and millimeter scales necessary in practical systems. Demonstration of the techniques developed in this research will significantly advance our ability to leverage biological systems in the design and development of more complex, self-organizing electronic systems.

Lutz	07/31/2009	$132,928.00		doepke@northwestern.edu	10889 Wilshire Boulevard	LOS ANGELES	CA	900951406	3107940102	SBE	1320	0000, OTHR	$0.00	This proposal outlines research on the redistribution effects of inflation. Redistribution of real wealth is an immediate consequence of any unanticipated change in the price level. Inflation lowers the real value of nominal assets and liabilities, and thereby shifts wealth from lenders to borrowers. Existing studies have focused on the revaluation of government debt. The research described in this proposal considers the revaluation of all nominal assets and liabilities in the economy. The goal is to provide a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the redistribution effects of inflation, as well as their implications for macroeconomic aggregates and welfare.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is that it enhances our understanding of the real effects of inflation. The proposal achieves this objective by employing two analytical tools. The first is an empirical framework used to document exposure to inflation risk in the United States, for different sectors as well as age and wealth groups of households. The framework combines sectoral data from the Flow of Funds Accounts, household-level data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, as well as data on the payoff structure and market prices of nominal assets to construct a consistent array of nominal positions. To gauge the duration of these positions, future payment streams are estimated by date, agent, and type of nominal instrument. The second tool is a dynamic general equilibrium model that can be used to assess the economic effects of redistribution shocks. The model allows for heterogeneity along the same dimensions as the data; it is calibrated to match key macroeconomic aggregates as well as properties of the wealth and income distribution. It can also accommodate various fiscal policy scenarios that may arise in response to an inflation episode. The proposal describes an application that uses the tools to quantify the wealth redistribution that would occur if the United States were to enter another moderate inflation episode similar to that of the 1970s. This application leads to three main results. First, even moderate inflation can cause a sizable redistribution of wealth. The main winners from inflation would be the government and young households with mortgage debt, while the main losers would be old households and, in light of the recent surge in foreign debt, foreigners. Second, the model shows that the responses of losers (old lenders) and winners (young borrowers) do not cancel out, so that redistribution due to inflation has aggregate effects. The magnitude of these effects is comparable to those in representative-agent models with monetary frictions, but the effects arising from redistribution persist long after the end of the inflation episode. Third, the welfare effect on domestic households is the opposite of what standard monetary models generate: inflation-induced redistribution has a positive effect on the weighted aggregate welfare. Overall, the application demonstrates that redistribution is an important channel for the impact of inflation on household behavior, economic aggregates, and welfare. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed research derives from its implications for monetary policy, as well as the design of institutions that help control inflation. The existing application shows that households have important reasons to disagree about monetary policy. The proposal describes a number of additional policy applications. First, the setup will be used to assess the redistribution effects of stabilization policy. Here the objective is to quantify the wealth effects of U.S. monetary policy in the 1980s. A second extension will explore the political economy implications of the findings. The existing results show that there are circumstances such that a majority of households stands to gain from inflation-induced redistribution. Moreover, the fiscal policy package that accompanies an inflationary episode is a key factor in shaping public support for inflation policies. The proposal outlines an empirical investigation of the degree to which redistribution concerns can explain the emergence of historical episodes of high inflation, as well as an extended theoretical analysis of the political economy of inflation.

Despite widespread adoption, analysis of such techniques remains non-standardized, especially when multiple GIGR systems are used concurrently or in conjunction with existing retaining walls and foundations. As American cities age, rehabilitation of existing geotechnical installations will further popularize usage of these techniques. Despite this growing popularity, an accurate, robust method for design of such systems does not exist. Key to the development of such design methods is the understanding of underlying load transfer mechanisms, supported by experimental efforts. Such studies help substantiate the applicability of new emerging field-employed methods while providing a database for model evaluation. To this end, in this project, we focus our study on the issue of rehabilitation of pile groups in urban areas when either (1) site conditions or geology preclude transfer beams usage, (2) the removal of existing piles may destabilize nearby structures, or (3) where sustainability is being promoted through building reuse. Our emphasis is on developing the necessary centrifuge tools to support the needed experimental investigations, which will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of load transfer of these rehabilitation systems.<br/><br/> Specifically, this project will develop helical pier placement and in-flight grouting techniques and tools for the University of California, Davis NEES centrifuge facility. Such techniques and tools will be useful not only for foundation improvement and rehabilitation, but also for the broader category of ground improvement studies. The work plan has three primary objectives: (i) develop suitable in-flight grout placement tools and techniques to simulate the improved foundation systems, (ii) conduct one centrifuge series to verify the capability of the grouting method and employ it for load capacity enhancement of one pile group foundation, and (iii) enable much needed links with international researchers to benefit from previous and ongoing research during (i) and (ii) and collaboratively disseminate findings. In-flight grout placement will be explored using either fixed grout stations (stations placed at one-g, with grout deployed at N-g), or robot-controlled placement of grout or a combination of both. The new robot arm being constructed through the NEES project makes the later technique a plausible alternative to explore.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED WORK<br/>In terms of technical contribution, if successful, this work will provide the foundation for the broader geotechnical centrifuge user community to apply in-flight grouting techniques, greatly expanding the capabilities of physical model testing. Further, the foundation rehabilitation solution investigated, and the completion of one series of centrifuge experiments will help substantiate its use, and provide guidance for subsequent testing needs. The unique international collaboration, as well as involvement with European initiatives (RUFUS), further strengthens the broader reach of this work. Finally, this proposal involves a team of junior level researchers (two of whom are female), with a dedication towards recruiting a diverse population of research students, for involvement in this project.

Early motivation for this was provided by the discovery of hidden damages in steel<br/>structures caused by the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Great Hanshin (Kobe) Earthquakes, and also<br/>by the fact that structural element are usually inaccessible after construction. Several analytical<br/>methods have been proposed in the literature and still more are being developed for this.<br/>Currently simulated data are being used to check the effectiveness of these methods; however,<br/>their validation and comparison on actual experimentally obtained data is yet to be done.<br/>In this exploratory project, it is proposed to experimentally study and validate the<br/>effectives of the autoregressive with exogenous input model, wavelet transform, eigensystem<br/>realization algorithms (ERA), and subspace identification (SSI) approaches for comprehensive<br/>modal and damage identification of civil engineering structures. For damage localization and<br/>quantification the flexibility and rotational flexibility matrices with and without and damage locating<br/>vectors will be used. Further analytical improvements in these methods will also be made for<br/>more reliable damage quantification. The tests will be conducted on a scaled three-story, nine<br/>degrees-of-freedom structure model prepared such that its stiffness properties can be changed<br/>by planned changes in one or more braces, by sudden removal of one or two braces in real-time<br/>using magneto-rheological dampers, and by loosening the connecting hardware at few selected<br/>joints. The major cost of preparing this changeable scaled model will be borne by the PIs<br/>institution. The scaled model will be excited at its base by the 5' by 5' shaking table at Virginia<br/>Tech. The model would also have the capability of being excited by shakers installed at any of<br/>the three levels. The dynamic measurements of the acceleration response will be made using<br/>ten accelerometers, three placed at each floor level in two orthogonal directions plus one on the<br/>table.<br/><br/>The SGER funding is being sought to identify validated damage localization and<br/>quantification methods which will be needed in a more comprehensive follow-up study. This<br/>follow-up study to be proposed later will develop an integrated system consisting of the validated<br/>damage identification techniques with online consequence prognosis followed by online<br/>actuation, if necessary, of a control system to maintain the performance of the structure at an<br/>acceptable level. The successful outcome of this exploratory work will also be a very useful tool<br/>for direct practical implementation in structural diagnostics and health monitoring.<br/><br/>The Intellectual merit of this study is in the development of experimentally verified<br/>damage identification (detection, localization, and quantification) schemes for a comprehensive<br/>structural health monitoring.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this research will occur at two levels: the<br/>education and training of graduate and undergraduate students and the availability of a much<br/>needed tool and data to researchers and practitioners involved in structural health monitoring. A<br/>graduate student and an undergraduate student will work on this project. The undergraduate<br/>student will be supported through the REU program. She/he will be selected through the Center<br/>for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity (CEED) at Virginia Tech from the pool of available<br/>African American, Hispanic, American Indian, and women students. The dissemination of<br/>information and data generated in this research to other students, researchers and practitioners<br/>will be done through class room teaching, website creation, presentations in conferences, and<br/>publications in archival journals and conference proceedings.

X-ray and optical studies so far seem to show that the physical characteristics of groups deviate significantly from those of larger clusters. Groups dominated by spiral galaxies differ dramatically from groups dominated by ellipticals. This broad observational study of galaxy groups at low and intermediate redshift is designed to address two fundamental questions: what is the true distribution of mass in groups, and how have groups evolved over time? The principal (radio) observations will include an HI survey, a deep continuum survey, a study of bent radio sources, and a pilot experiment to map the diffuse continuum emission. Complementary optical observations will also be brought to bear on this study.<br/><br/>Broader impacts center on the Universe in the Park program of public outreach, involvement of undergraduate students in the research, and a continued commitment to attracting underrepresented minorities.

This will address the often-missed operational characteristics of the system under study in Environmentally Benign Design and Manufacturing. The gap has been cause in some cases due to over simplification of assumptions stemming from too broad or too narrow definitions of what is termed the EBDM system. The long term goal of the research is to determine the mechanism for integrating the environmental impacts of operational decisions made across and between the levels of the manufacturing enterprise. This investigation takes the first step in order to lead to a better understanding, and identification of, the operational level factors that have potential for positive and adverse environmental impact. The broader impacts include enabling the first green manufacturing effort in Kansas through EBDM activities at the local and regional level. The focus on the manufacturing supply chain can be broadly applied beyond this regional scope, once the preliminary understanding of the environmental performance and operational characteristics are better understood.

Specifically, the researcher proposes to test the hypothesis that high biomass observed in satellite imagery in the northwestern Gulf of Alaska (GoA) during mid-summer months results from high river runoff into the Alaskan Coastal Current during this time of year, and mixing of this coastal water rich in dissolved and leachable particulate iron with the HNLC waters of the adjacent GoA via mesoscale eddies. To test the hypothesis, the PI will determine the distribution of dissolved and particulate iron (and other micronutrient trace metals) versus the distribution of macronutrients to assess the supply and demand of micro- and macronutrient elements in the northwestern GoA. In addition, the degree to which particulate iron is solubilized and becomes bioavailable will be determined using a series of grow out experiments with stable isotopes of iron. This data will also serve to fill in gaps for iron distributions in coastal regions. Another high chlorophyll region off Point Conception, CA will also be studied. <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this study will not only further our understanding of iron cycling in the northern GoA and off Point Conception, California, but provide much needed information on ecosystem productivity in these economically important coastal regions. Results from this project will be presented at local service clubs and in a display for K-12 students at the Seymour Discover Center of the Long Marine Lab. Training of graduate students and post-docs is included in the study.

They are used in stream cipher cryptosystems; in spread spectrum systems in cellular telephones, GPS systems, and satellite<br/>communications; and as codewords in error-correcting codes for digital communication. Pseudorandom sequences of large numbers are used in large simulations for such applications as weather prediction, reactor design, oil well exploration, radiation cancer therapy, traffic flow, and pricing of financial instruments. In each case sequences with particular properties are needed. Yet few general methods for efficient generation of pseudorandom sequences are known. This research involves the development and analysis of a large supply of pseudorandom sequences for a variety of applications in cryptography, coding theory, and simulations.<br/><br/>In 1994 A. Klapper and M. Goresky proposed feedback-with-carry shift registers (FCSRs), a class of pseudorandom generators which are easily implemented and which rapidly generate pseudorandom sequences with many desirable properties. These were later generalized to algebraic feedback shift registers (AFSRs). Many basic properties of FCSRs and AFSRs have been determined. This project addresses issues concerning FCSR and AFSR sequences including (1) design of combiners, feedforward functions, and clock-controlled circuits for the generation of cryptographically secure sequences, (2) design of fast and efficient FCSRs with good statistical properties for use in quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC), (3) analysis and design of several new AFSR generators with applications to stream ciphers and QMC, (4) solution of the register synthesis problem for AFSRs, and (5) development of new families of error correcting block and convolutional codes based on<br/>AFSR sequences.
0524996	Doctoral Dissertation Improvement: Investigating How Ecology and Demography Influence Folivorous Primate Biomass in Eastern Ecuador.

Because most of the variation exhibited in primate communities can be accounted for by leaf-eating species, previous research primarily focussed on folivorous primates. The major factors suggested to influence folivore biomass are leaf quality, seasonality, habitat heterogeneity, and resource competition. However, most research has focussed on primates of the Old World. Because New World monkeys exhibit a different digestive morphology, the results may not be representative. More importantly, most of the previous research has investigated possibly influencing factors individually (univariate). However, recent research in paleobiology and ecology has revealed a more complete understanding of complex processes through multivariate approaches.<br/>This study will take such a multivariate approach investigating the factors influencing the biomass of the most folivorous neotropical primate, the red howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus). Guided by previous research results, we identified 10 ecological variables with unique predictive combinations for 15 demographic and behavioral variables. The unique signatures for each individual variable allow identifying the most important factors, which are driving population densities. The project will be the first of its kind to use such a wide-ranging approach. It will also provide a comparative basis to determine whether factors influencing biomass are similar across taxa from different primate radiations.<br/>The study will take place at Yasuni National Park, Ecuador, an area of extreme biodiversity and one of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Reserves. Data will be collected at two sites in close proximity (ca. 40 km apart) differing in population density of red howler monkeys, general habitat characteristics, and hunting pressure. Data collection will include monitoring the demography and densities of the two primate communities, observation of the activity and ranging behavior of altogether 7 groups, and collection of fecal samples and visual assessment of bot fly infestations to judge parasite load. The ecology of the habitat will be monitored based on botanical and phenological transects. Soil and food samples will be taken and their nutrient content analyzed. Finally, interviews with local Huaorani hunters and market surveys will serve to monitor hunting pressure.<br/>In terms of broader impact, the aims are 3-fold. The study will provide key data to be incorporated into future management plans of the park. In addition, the study provides training and career opportunities for assistants from Ecuador and other countries and is build upon and encourages cooperation with institutions in Ecuador (Universidad San Franscico de Quito, Ponticifica Universidad Catolica de Ecuador), USA (Cornell University), and Germany (University of Hamburg). Lastly, the project encourages an active involvement of the local community in the park and the project. During the preparatory parts of the study monthly meetings with three Huaorani Indian communities have been established in order to aid in conservation efforts, provide them with information about the ecology of their forest, and how the results of this study may impact their lives.

The technological motivation for this collaboration is derived from the need to expand the reliability and functionality of current MEMS materials. The overarching scientific theme involves judicious control and optimization of processing parameters in a way that will tailor the underlying microstructure and attendant mechanical properties of novel LIGA MEMS materials. Current LIGA structures are severely limited by their dismal high temperature properties, and the focus of the proposed research will be on the development of new electrodeposited MEMS: high temperature alloys, dispersion strengthened composites and Ni-base superalloys. Processing issues related to the fabrication of micron- sized structures will be addressed at FZK (the birthplace of LIGA), and unique characterization and elevated temperature microsample testing techniques (recently developed at JHU) will be employed to characterize the full-range of mechanical properties of these new materials. Non-Technical: To date, the majority of commercial MEMS devices have been thin film sensors manufactured using chemical and vapor deposition processes. Future MEMS applications will not be restricted to two-dimensional structures and the development of elevated temperature LIGA materials is predicted to be an enabling technology in regard to the development of next generation MEMS. Close collaboration between the two institutions, providing complementary and synergistic expertise, will be required to fulfill the scientific mission of the proposal, and integrated exchanges of graduate students and senior researcher scientists will both create the vehicle for this collaboration and provide a unique educational experience for all participants. Moreover, the proposed participation in Congressional Visit Days will introduce JHU students to the need and opportunity for young scientists to educate congressional members and staffers and in so doing promote the support of science and technology on Capital Hill.

The behavior of chimpanzees has been studied in an extremely large community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda for ten years. The project will combine results of this research with those from ongoing and proposed genetic analyses to address several unresolved questions about chimpanzee behavior: Does high mating competition affect the relationship between male dominance rank and reproduction? Does cooperation yield direct reproductive payoffs to male chimpanzees? How do males benefit from patrolling territory boundaries and engaging in inter-group aggression? Do males enhance their reproduction by associating selectively with certain females? Do males bias their behavior toward their paternal kin and selectively affiliate with and aid their offspring?<br/><br/>Intellectual merit of the proposed activity. The question of how behavior contributes to the survival and reproduction of individuals is crucial to research on animal behavior, but is extremely difficult to address in long-lived animals that reproduce slowly, including most primates. The difficulties of collecting genetic data and the small sizes of primate social groups also hinder strong tests of hypotheses. Long-term behavioral data on an unprecedented large chimpanzee community has already made important contributions to understanding the behavioral strategies of male chimpanzees. Continued data collection combined with genetic data will fill significant gaps in knowledge about chimpanzee behavior. Notably, inspired by recent research questioning conventional wisdom that nonhuman primates cannot recognize paternal kin, this will project will test the hypothesis that paternal relatedness affects the behavior of male chimpanzees. Also, a more complete understanding of why cooperation among males, rare in the animal kingdom, is so prominent in chimpanzees.<br/><br/>Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity. This study will continue to furnish research opportunities for graduate students from North America and to promote collaboration with and provide support for a Ugandan scientist who manages the chimpanzee field project and pursues independent long-term research at Ngogo. An important component of the proposed research is to train several Ugandan graduate students, committed to the study of animal behavior and to the conservation of biodiversity. Sustained presence of the North American Research Group in Kibale National Park will help to safeguard one of the last vestiges of rainforest in East Africa, while training and supporting North American and Ugandan students, which will in turn ensure that conservation efforts are maintained into the future. Past and ongoing outreach efforts help to educate the public as well as promote conservation.

Work in this field has been concentrated on idealized models such as the standard Gaussian model, what has not been addressed is the potential of many other models which have more realism and impact. In this proposal, the investigator studies problems in three areas: (a). Formulation of massive data -- Develop models which have <br/>Scientific realism and impact, as well as mathematical simplicity such that careful study is possible. (b). Development of new tools -- By exploring a wide variety of models, expose new phenomena and develop tools which are easy-to-implement and theoretically sound. (c). Delicate asymptotic study -- Lay out framework for asymptotic study, carefully compare the existing and newly proposed inference tools, study on the optimality of such tools.<br/><br/>The motivation of this project lies in that, massive datasets produced in scientific areas such as Genomics, astronomy, and image processing lead to a new field in statistics: large-scale simultaneous hypothesis testing or multiple comparisons. The vision is advances in this new field will enable the scientists from various scientific fields to quickly extract the information they need from massive datasets, and it is the immediate <br/>interest of the statistics community to develop easy-to-implement tools. This project pushes the boundary of the field by developing new tools and novel theories, as well as exposing new phenomena. The project produces tools which are theoretically sounding and practically feasible for solving problems in areas such as Genomics, astronomy, and image processing.

That gas is readily observed in the spectra of quasars and its detailed properties contain a highly sensitive record of the main parameters of the Universe.  This project will use a combination of observations and simulations to read that record, focusing on two key interrelated topics: the measurement of precise cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the detection and measurement of the effects of energy flows from quasars and galaxies into the intergalactic gas.  A large set of high resolution quasar spectra from the Keck observatory will be compared to various sophisticated simulations to study the amount of dark energy, the amplitude and slope of the power spectrum of matter on small scales, the ionization and temperature of the intergalactic gas, the intensity and spectrum of the ionizing radiation, and the energy input from quasars and galaxies, including the input and distribution of metals.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the work builds upon the team's long record of integrating education and diversity with their research.  Past emphasis on under-represented groups will continue.

As such models involve unobserved, spatially-correlated variables, modeling these processes will require the development of flexible variogram models that will conform to a wide variety of random processes. These are approached through process-convolution models. The investigators are considering a variety of special cases, including cokriging, generalized (hierarchical) spatial models, spatial compositional data and Poisson process models. They are exploring several computational approaches, including generalized estimating equations, MCMC and expectation-maximization. They are also identifying spectral, sparse matrix and other approaches to reduce the computational burden of the analysis. The software they are developing will allow researchers in many fields to analyze multivariable spatial models.<br/><br/>Many research projects produce data that is associated with locations on a map. For instance, an epidemiological study might consist of air pollution measurements taken at several fixed locations, along with the locations of households where an occupant was hospitalized with a pollution-related ailment. In this case the air pollution measurement is a geostatistical variable (it could, in theory, be measured at any location on the map) and the households are a point process. Other examples might include multiple geostatistical variables: for instance, soil nitrogen and soil moisture measured at multiple locations in an ecological study. Multiple geostatistical variables and point process variables are special cases of what are called multivariate or hierarchical spatial models. The investigators are developing the general theory of these models, and are producing software that can efficiently analyze these models. Dissemination of the software will allow the development of more sophisticated models for mapped data in many applied fields.
0513509	The D-bar Method in Electrical Impedance Tomography	DMS	COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS	09/01/2005	08/08/2007	Jennifer Mueller	CO	Colorado State University	Continuing grant	Junping Wang	08/31/2008	$111,996.00		mueller@math.colostate.edu	601 S Howes St	Fort Collins	CO	805232002	9704916355	MPS	1271	0000, 9263, OTHR	$0.00	Reconstruction algorithms for two and three-dimensional electrical impedance tomography (EIT) are developed.  EIT is a relatively new medical imaging technique in which electrodes are placed on the surface of the body, current is applied on the electrodes, and the resulting voltage is measured on the electrodes.  Since the various organs and tissues in the body frequently have different conductive properties, an image is formed from the reconstructed conductivity distribution.  In this research the D- bar reconstruction algorithm for 2-D EIT based on the paper by Nachman [Ann. Of Math. 143 (1996)] will be further developed through a study of the algorithm applied to discontinuous conductivities, a study of electrode effects on the algorithm, incorporating boundary reconstruction in the numerical algorithm, more accurate computations of the scattering transform, and adapting the algorithm to non-circular geometries.  This work is expected to improve the accuracy of the method and bring it to a clinically useful stage.  In addition, a 3-D D-bar algorithm will be developed for EIT data collected on planar electrode arrays.  The particular clinical application for the 3-D algorithm is breast cancer detection.<br/><br/>This work will provide further insight into the D-bar method in two and three dimensions.  The terminology D-bar method comes from the techniques in inverse scattering which result in a D-bar equation, which is a certain type of partial differential equation in complex variables, to be solved in the reconstruction process.  The 2-D D-bar algorithm is the only direct (non-iterative) method for EIT solving the full nonlinear conductivity problem to have been successfully implemented on experimental EIT data.  At present, no direct numerically implemented method exists for EIT in three dimensions.   The 2-D EIT problem has an important application as a method for monitoring patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  ARDS is a life-threatening condition in which inflammation of the lungs and fluid in the air sacs leads to low blood oxygen levels.  The treatment is mechanical ventilation, which has potential side-effects to the lungs.  By placing electrodes around the patient's thorax, EIT can be used to continually monitor ARDS patients, providing information about their condition and aiding in determining the proper ventilator settings to minimize side-effects.  A 3-D D-bar reconstruction algorithm with the main application of breast cancer detection has the potential to reconstruct the conductivity values with more accuracy than existing algorithms and thus may improve the specificity of EIT as a method of breast cancer detection.  EIT as a tool for breast cancer detection is in the early stages, and the development and study of a 3-D D-bar algorithm will provide a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of EIT for this application.

AREO is envisioned as a means of monitoring ecological processes on the continent of Antarctica and adjacent near-shore marine environments. The AREO will be organized to answer regional- to continental-scale scientific questions and to facilitate the interdisciplinary participation necessary to achieve credible ecological forecasting and prediction. AREO is seen as an observing system that will provide a continental-scale perspective and integration for individual projects, in addition to NEON sponsored projects. The AREO workshop will encourage social scientists, educators, ecologists, and physical scientists to participate in AREO planning and design, as well as to participate as Observatory users. For Antarctica, a continent without national boundaries, the participation of international scientists and educators is important. A broad and diverse group will be invited to participate. Women are currently well represented in AREO and therefore a good gender distribution is expected for the workshop. Minorities will be identified to the fullest extent possible. Key non-governmental agencies and international organizations will also be encouraged to participate

These equations model a variety of physical processes involving multiple length scales, requiring significantly new mathematical and numerical approaches. Specific topics include the scale transition, pattern formation as well as the time regularity of solutions in terms of fundamental physical scales. Mathematical analysis will include justification of scaling limits, stability of wave patterns, and numerical analysis of schemes for computing solutions of these problems.<br/><br/> This research has many applications including plasma sheath formation, high frequency wave propagation and dispersive wave dynamics in a variety of physical processes. The proposed work is expected to have a significant impact not only on these areas, but also to other fields dealing with multi-scale wave dynamics including, but not restricted to geophysics, materials science and mobile telecommunication technologies. The goal is to develop new mathematical tools and computational methods that will significantly advance the state of the art. The theory will be used and driven by identified practical applications. It is also expected that this study will be of fundamental importance to the general theory of nonlinear partial differential equations.

To date, technologies for proteome-wide analysis of protein expression and phosphorylation have not been established in plants. The objective of this project is to develop, apply, and establish new tools for comparative proteomics by systematically studying proteins whose expression level or phosphorylation state or both are regulated by the plant hormone abscisic acid in the model plant Arabidopsis. Isotope-coded affinity tagging and metabolic labeling will be applied for quantitation of protein expression. Phosphorylation state of proteins will be determined by mass spectrometry after enrichment of phosphopeptides. By analyzing both protein expression and phosphorylation state, proteins that undergo a change in phosphorylation without a corresponding change in expression or vice versa can be identified. This project is most likely to lead to discovery of novel abscisic acid-regulated proteins and the development of testable hypotheses about these proteins in abscisic acid signaling. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The technologies developed from this project will serve as useful tools for plant biologists to systematically analyze protein expression and phosphorylation in their favorite systems. All in vivo protein phosphorylation sites determined in this project will be posted on the PlantsP database (http://plantsp.sdsc.edu). Detailed protocols developed from this project will be posted on a publicly accessable website. This project will provide excellent opportunities to train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows from an EPSCoR state to perform state-of-the art research in quantitative proteomics.

Since then quantum computer scientists have been focusing on finding the group of computational problems where speed-ups of this magnitude can be obtained. The present proposal targets a systematic study of this question using two different methods.<br/><br/>The first method is based on earlier work by the PI, where he showed that the process of quantum walks (i.e. the repeated use of a quantum operator made by quantizing <br/>a classical operator) can be used to speed up a large class of classical algorithms. The proposal describes new kinds of quantum walks that could solve more problems than previous ones and attain larger speed-ups. This topic comprises many open questions, which the PI and his students wish to investigate.<br/><br/>The second method relates to the black box model, which captures the speed of a quantum algorithm by finding out how many times it has to use different subroutines. At present, this model has proved to be the most successful tool in the comprehensive study of quantum algorithms and is often a faithful indicator of their complexities. The PI's previous works on the black box model are well-known in the quantum computing community. The proposal raises several new research ideas that aim at a better understanding of the black box model.<br/><br/>Quantum computation research efforts often lead to interesting discoveries about classical algorithms, which is an unexpected new development in the theory of computing. While researching the two methods above, the PI and his students plan to keep a watchful eye on this new benefit.<br/><br/>The PI is currently building a quantum computing group at Rutgers, The State University of NJ. The PI has been approached by several interested students both at the graduate and undergraduate levels, and several colleagues have indicated as well that they would be ready to participate in the research efforts of such a group. The PI gained support from the deans and DIMACS, and built partnerships with quantum groups at Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs and NEC. Support from NSF is needed primarily for student research assistantships.

Burrows at the University of Utah who proposes to explore mechanistically how DNA-protein crosslinks arise during the course of oxidative damage. Oxidative insult to chromatin leading to formation of DNA-protein crosslinks is poorly understood at the molecular level. Studies outlined in the proposal build on recent results showing that 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydroguanosine is sensitive to further oxidation by one-electron oxidants leading to a quinonoid intermediate that is nucleophilically trapped to ultimately generate hydantoin products. Methods will be developed to understand the chemical structures responsible for DNA-protein crosslinking via both DNA oxidation and protein oxidation. Professor Burrows hopes to formulate a detailed molecular picture of how DNA is oxidized in the presence of reactive species such as protein and polyamine nucleophiles.<br/><br/>The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Cynthia J. Burrows who will train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students to be well versed in mechanistic organic chemistry. These students will also gain biotechnical skills in the manipulation of nucleic acids and proteins and contribute to our molecular understanding of DNA damage, which underlies processes leading to aging, cancer, and neurological disorders. In addition, Professor Burrows' laboratory will continue to serve as a resource to faculty members at 4-year institutions to collaborate on projects in nucleic acid chemistry and to provide mass spectrometry expertise to assist these collaborations.

The measurement is based<br/>on the contact between a synthetic polymer membrane and a quartz crystal resonator. The<br/>membrane consists of an elastic layer at the air/water interface, and is an excellent model for a<br/>variety of materials ranging from synthetic polymer gels to living tissues. The membrane<br/>surface and the surface with which it interacts will both be coated with molecules that are<br/>designed to eliminate non-specific background adhesion between the two surfaces. Specific<br/>adhesion molecules will then be added to both surfaces, and the adhesion energy will be related<br/>to the interaction potential of the individual bonds, and to their surface concentration. The<br/>experiments are conceptually similar to dewetting experiments, with contact of the membrane<br/>and the surface corresponding to a region where water has been largely excluded from between<br/>the contacting surfaces. The experimental geometry is designed to give sensitivity to very small<br/>contact angles, and hence to very small adhesive interactions. Membrane elasticity serves two<br/>important functions. The first of these is to extend the range of adhesive interactions that can be<br/>probed so that the molecular origins of mechanical toughness of soft, highly deformable<br/>materials can be thoroughly investigated. The second function of membrane elasticity is to<br/>provide a means for fixing the adhesive molecules in place while isolating the system from the<br/>surrounding air environment so that the surfaces remain hydrated, even while in mechanical<br/>contact with one another. A detailed mechanical analysis will be developed for cases where the<br/>adhesion energy is large enough so that elastic effects must be taken into account. Additional<br/>information about the nature of the mechanical contact will be obtained by monitoring the<br/>frequency shift and dissipation of the quartz crystal resonators in the vicinity of a mechanical<br/>resonance of the crystal. The experimental methodology can be applied to a wide variety of<br/>adhesion problems in polymer physics and in biology, but experiments will begin with studies<br/>utilizing adhesive molecules that are very well characterized at the single molecule level.<br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The PI has developed a unique online multimedia text in polymer science that will undergo<br/>continued revision during this funding cycle. Additional contributions to undergraduate and<br/>undergraduate education will result directly from the proposed work, with three Ph.D. students<br/>and between 6 and 8 undergraduate students being trained in various aspects of mechanics,<br/>polymer physics and polymer synthesis. International experience will also be obtained as part of<br/>a collaboration with Prof. Diethelm Johannsmann at the University of Clausthal in Germany.<br/>Two Ph.D. students will conduct research in the Johannsmann laboratory during the course of<br/>this project, and two students from the Johannsmann laboratory will visit the PI's lab at<br/>Northwestern. Existing outreach activities will continue at local high schools and middle schools<br/>in Evanston and Chicago. The enhancements in mechanical characterization capabilities<br/>resulting from the proposed work will benefit a variety of research groups at Northwestern, in<br/>addition to scientists and engineers at local companies who utilize the micromechanics lab<br/>supervised by the PI. The broader scientific impact of the work will be felt most strongly in the<br/>biomaterials community, by providing a means for quantifying adhesion in practically relevant<br/>biological systems that are amenable to the membrane geometry.

Unfortunately, this gas is mostly molecular hydrogen, which does not radiate easily, and so observations must rely on tracer molecules that are more easily detected, the commonest of which is carbon monoxide (CO). However, in the most energetic regions, changes in cloud chemistry mean that other molecules may be better tracers. Single-dish spectra of nearby starburst galaxies show that global chemical differences among galaxies can be significant, which calls into question the use of CO, or, indeed, any other single molecule as a tracer of molecular clouds and gas mass. This project will focus on the chemical properties of the centers of the closest spiral galaxies, where giant molecular clouds can be resolved in line images, studying at least seven molecules and looking for correlations, trying to find simple characterizations of the cloud chemistry.<br/><br/>This work on the chemical imaging of galaxies is the first of its kind. In addition to revealing the astrophysical environments in these galaxies, this research may place constraints on individual chemical reactions, identifying gas-phase and gas-grain chemistry, and working towards the study of many, much more distant, galaxies with future millimeter array instruments.

Specifically, the reaction of triplet and singlet oxygen with imides, amides, alkoxides, alkylidenes, alkylidynes, and related complexes of group 4, 5, and 6 metals will be characterized and mechanistically evaluated. Additionally, the reactions of the alkoxides of these metals with hydrosilanes will be investigated. To provide a comparison to the reactions involving O2 and hydrosilanes, the reactions of water with transition metal complexes will be evaluated as routes to metal oxides (MOn) and metal silicates (M-Si O). These investigations will define mechanistic pathways to microelectronic MOn and M-Si-O materials. <br/><br/>There is much current interest in MOn and M-Si-O species as high dielectric constant gate materials and as capacitor materials for dynamic random access memory devices. The reactions that will be studied in this project are known to yield thin MOn and M-Si-O films, respectively, by chemical vapor deposition. This project will systematize the details of these preparations and determine the mechanisms of the reactions. This will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to develop new routes to microelectronic materials. Additionally, the research will provide training of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students in chemistry and materials science. Female and underrepresented minority students will participate in the project.

Some commonly used names for these systems are singularly perturbed systems, or systems with multiple time scales.<br/><br/>Examples of singularly perturbed systems in fluid dynamics, chemistry, mechanics, biology, and other sciences can be found throughout the scientific literature. For example, in recent decades there has been an explosion of interest in the mathematical modeling of neurons. Models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley equations (and their simplifications) for the voltage across the cell membrane of a neuron are often studied in singularly perturbed regimes.<br/><br/>Because it is rare for the equations that model these systems to have explicit analytical solutions, they are often analyzed with either analytical approximations or computer simulations. There are powerful analytical tools that provide approximate solutions to singularly perturbed problems. Unfortunately, the analysis required to derive an approximate solution by these methods can be intractable. One can resort to computer simulations when analysis fails, but singularly perturbed systems are notoriously difficult to solve by computer simulation.<br/><br/>In this project, we will create a collection of computer programs that avoid the computational difficulties of solving the full singularly perturbed system by instead solving the slow and fast phases separately. The slow and fast solutions will be combined to create an approximate solution to the full system. The approximations generated will not be as accurate as those found by solving the original system, but they will be faster to compute. They will be accurate enough to answer many important questions, and they will also help researchers to determine where they should apply more sophisticated methods.

However, the mammalian fetus is also exposed to another hormone, progesterone, which is produced by the maternal ovaries and the placenta during pregnancy. The effects of this exposure are unclear at this time, but recent evidence suggests that progesterone may actually masculinize the brain and later impact behavioral responses. <br/> Marsupial mammals offer a unique opportunity to directly explore the effects of progesterone on fetal development. Because marsupial mammals are very premature at birth compared to other mammals, much of their early development takes place outside the body of the mother, in an environment that is relatively free of progesterone. Therefore, marsupials are particularly useful for the study of reproductive development. With this animal model the effects of progesterone can be tightly controlled and directly measured, in the absence of maternal hormonal influences.<br/> Gray short tailed opossums (Monodelphis domestica), small, gerbil-sized laboratory marsupials, will be used here to characterize the effects of progesterone on the development of masculine and feminine characteristics and behavior in mammals. Opossums will be exposed to different amounts of progesterone soon after birth. When they are adults their behavior will be observed and hormone levels in their blood will be measured. It is expected that early exposure to progesterone will decrease feminine hormonal and behavioral traits in adult animals. <br/> Progesterone has wide effects on reproductive processes and brain function. It is already known that progesterone maintains pregnancy, activates reproductive and parental behavior and affects learning and memory. The new researchin this project will further extend our understanding of the role of this important hormone as it impacts reproductive development. This project will also provide a wide range of unique training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students with Dr. Harder at the Ohio State University (OSU) and with Dr. Fadem at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ).

The approach to be used incorporates detailed experimental characterization of composite tool erosion and its influence on surface structure development, followed by process modeling and verification experiments on commercial grinding platforms. Students participating in this project will be involved in educational and mentoring activities in addition to their research, with the results assessed in terms of their impact on both the participating students and their classmates.<br/><br/>If successful the benefits of this research will include an improved ability to use the inherently flexible and robust process of tool self-sharpening to grind and finish complex, ultra smooth parts from difficult to grind ceramic materials. Additionally, an improved understanding of the fundamental micromechanics of composite wear, and its influence on the development of surface structures at a fine scale, will be developed. This has potential applications in designing, manufacturing, and predicting the lifetime of composite materials for use in a wide range of additional applications. The research activities of students supported in this project will be leveraged with ongoing research and teaching to provide an enhanced educational experience for both the students directly involved and their classmates. This educational activity targets both retention and recruitment of students in science and engineering, and may be of benefit in improving the participation of diverse student populations.

Jameson	06/30/2008	$64,299.00		krasny@umich.edu	3003 South State St. Room 1062	Ann Arbor	MI	481091274	7347636438	MPS	1266, 1271	0000, 9263, OTHR	$0.00	The investigator will develop particle simulation techniques for vortex sheet motion in <br/>two- and three-dimensional fluid flows. Vortex sheets are weak solutions of the ideal fluid equations <br/>in which the vorticity is concentrated on a surface and they are widely used in fluid dynamics to <br/>represent thin shear layers in slightly viscous flow. Vortex sheet simulations encounter severe difficulties <br/>due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, singularity formation, and chaotic dynamics, but the investigator has <br/>shown that these difficulties can be overcome by regularizing the Biot-Savart kernel in the equation <br/>governing the motion of material points on the sheet surface. The present project extends the capability <br/>of these regularized particle simulations by developing an improved treecode algorithm for evaluating <br/>the Biot-Savart integral, and adaptive quadrature and particle insertion schemes to maintain resolution <br/>as the sheet rolls up. In contrast to other approaches using spherical harmonics, the present treecode <br/>algorithm uses Taylor approximations in Cartesian coordinates which provides more flexibility and enables <br/>the method to be applied to nonharmonic functions such as the regularized Biot-Savart kernel. <br/>The quadrature and insertion schemes to be developed will make essential use of the Lagrangian <br/>sheet parameterization. The investigator will perform particle simulations of vortex ring dynamics and will <br/>compare the results to laboratory experiments and direct numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. Other topics to be studied include high precision computation of spiral formation in the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem, and extension of the present techniques to density-stratified flow. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Computer simulation is a well established tool in basic and applied research in all areas of science <br/>and engineering. For example, automobile manufacturers, as well as pharmaceutical companies, <br/>routinely use computer simulations in the design of new products. A successful computer simulation relies <br/>on several components: a mathematical model of the physical problem, numerical algorithms for <br/>implementing the model on a computer, and computer hardware to perform the simulation. <br/>The present project focuses on the first two components by developing better models and algorithms <br/>for the computer simulation of fluid flows which are dominated by vortices. Vortices in air or water are <br/>usually invisible, but they can exert strong forces on nearby solid structures. One example is the trailing <br/>vortex wake behind an airplane which is responsible for the lift of the airplane, but also poses a hazard <br/>for nearby aircraft. In crowded urban airports with few runways, it is often necessary for an airplane to <br/>wait several minutes before taking off, to ensure that the wake of the preceding aircraft has dissipated <br/>to a safe level. The present investigation will contribute better algorithms for simulating the trailing wake <br/>which can be used by aeronautical engineers in designing methods to enhance wake dissipation <br/>and reduce takeoff delays. The algorithms developed in this project are also applicable to evaluating <br/>electrostatic forces at the molecular level, a generic computational problem with many potential <br/>applications in areas such as chemistry and plasma physics.

ADP1. Microbial catabolic pathways are good systems for studying biochemistry, genetics, and physiology. Moreover, their complex regulatory schemes can be exploited for biotechnology. In this project, mutational approaches will address the molecular basis of a novel synergism in transcriptional control. BenM is a LysR-type transcriptional regulator of benzoate catabolism that responds synergistically to two metabolites. The ability of one protein to integrate multiple cellular signals can effect rapid and large changes in gene expression. Understanding the response of BenM to effectors is important because it is a key representative of one of the largest groups of homologous regulators in bacteria. A successful collaboration with an X-ray crystallographer, Dr. Cory Momany, yielded well-characterized atomic level structures of the effector-binding domains of BenM and another paralog, CatM. Continued physiological investigations will test new regulatory models. Comparative studies between BenM and CatM provide unique opportunities to determine sequences that govern effector-regulated transcription. Although both regulators are similar in sequence and respond to the metabolite cis,cis-muconate, only BenM responds additionally to benzoate. The overlap in regulation between BenM and CatM will be used to dissect the functional significance of sequences in the proteins and in their target DNA promoters. These studies will elucidate complex regulatory circuits. Students will be trained in an important multidisciplinary area bridging microbial physiology and structural biology. Understanding LysR-type regulators has broad relevance for bioremediation and biotechnology, including the development of biosensors to detect harmful compounds.

Interpretation is cast as a problem of simultaneous image segmentation and region classification: Given an image and a list of class labels, the goal is to compute the most probable image segmentation and labeling, one label per segment. This is learning in context in that learning techniques are used to recognize several objects in the context of complex, cluttered images<br/><br/>A manual image labeling method is proposed that enlists the help of both web surfers and the students in a junior-high school and a high school to tackle this labor intensive task, while at the same time exposing young pupils to computer vision research.<br/><br/>The proposed work has intellectual merit of relevance to the fields of computer vision, artificial intelligence, and cognition in general. In particular, the notion of defining ``words for pictures'' that this proposal offers may establish a new, fruitful bridge to text retrieval research and widen the discourse computer vision has been entertaining with other areas of science.<br/><br/>The understanding of visual perception in its more semantic sense of ``image interpretation'' will undeniably have a broader impact on society. From a practical point of view, image understanding systems are useful for information retrieval, surveillance, medical imaging, and in many other endeavors. In addition, the proposed activities include collaboration with industry and government agencies and involve postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students. These activities also explicitly involve younger pupils in grades 6 through 12, and will hopefully help attract them to computer vision.<br/><br/>0535152/0535166<br/><br/>This project addresses the problem of category-level object recognition in images: Its aim is to develop effective methodologies for representing object classes; learning the corresponding object models from cluttered sample images in a semi-supervised manner; and efficiently and robustly recognizing instances of these models in novel images despite clutter, occlusion, viewpoint and illumination changes, and individual variations within each class. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The scientific objective of this project is to develop a representation of the salient parts of an object and their relationships that can effectively be learned from<br/>heavily cluttered data in a weakly supervised way, correctly captures within-class variability and appearance changes due to variations in viewpoint and illumination, and effectively supports inference over object models and the automated construction of efficient classification machines.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This project will investigate applications of category-level object recognition to image retrieval, video annotation, human-computer interaction; surveillance and security; and robotics via international academic and industrial collaborations.

The research includes both theory and numerical simulations, which will be compared with observations. The macroscopic study of jet dynamics will address whether and where jets are magnetically or kinetically dominated, which involves estimating the sound, Alfven and flow speeds, heating and cooling rates, and viscosity, for both the jet and the medium. This research will use relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic theory and simulations. The microscopic process study will determine the required properties of shocks in jets, studying particle acceleration, magnetic field generation, and high frequency emission from AGN and GRBs.

Johnson	06/30/2009	$59,376.00		rumble@gl.ciw.edu	1530 P ST NW	WASHINGTON	DC	200051910	2023876400	GEO	1581	0000, OTHR	$0.00	0507331<br/>Rumble<br/><br/>This project will continue geochemical and chronological analyses of drill core and outcrop samples obtained in the course of studying an ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) terrane in China. The Chinese Continental Drilling Project (CCSD), in the Donghai area of the Sulu terrane, provides a unique opportunity to study this important belt in three dimensions. The drilling is just now winding up with the completion of several shallow holes and one 5-km deep borehole. Field studies of the Dabie-Sulu belt and the initial studies of borehole samples have provided many new insights into the processes involved in the subduction and exhumation of continental material and into the processes of high P - low T metamorphism; presently a hot topic in earth sciences. Specifically, the Dabie-Sulu suture zone appears to be one of the best places in the world to address the conditions under which crustal rocks are taken to depths of more than 100 km and then returned to the surface, as well as the question of how mantle rocks from depths of >200 km are transported to shallow depths and incorporated into subducted continental slabs or mountain belts. The project is the continuation of the PI's long term collaborations with Chinese colleagues who have played a major role in the drilling. The major US role involves detailed mineralogical studies of drill core samples.

This proposal<br/>aims to jump-start this process by designing quantum devices whose inherit physics enforces self-correction of the quantum errors arising due to decoherence, imprecise device fabrication, and<br/>faulty quantum control.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Understanding how robust computation can emerge from simple physical<br/>systems is one of the great challenges addressed by our proposal for self-correcting quantum<br/>computers, but this problem is ubiquitous across many fields, including both nanotechnology and<br/>the biological sciences, where higher level function emerges from noisy constituent components.<br/>Further, the substance of a self-correcting quantum computer will represent a new phase of matter<br/>for quantum many-body systems, and insights gained in this proposal are likely to be essential to<br/>understand the properties of many other quantum many-body systems.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Since the ideas of self-correcting quantum computing have the potential to<br/>revolutionize how we conceive of building a quantum computer, the broad impact of this proposal<br/>will be disseminated to educators and journalists in workshops and public lectures. In addition development<br/>of a seminar and courseware bridge the gap between theoretical fault-tolerance and the<br/>fault-tolerance of physical devices will be pursued. Finally, this proposal would further enhance the<br/>education and interdisciplinary research environment at the University of Washington by bringing<br/>one of the PIs (Bacon) to the campus, who naturally rests between the Computer Science, Physics<br/>and Chemistry departments.

0509019	Collaborative Research on the Genetic Efects of Culture: Y Chromosome DNA, mtDNA, and Patrilineal Kinship in the Dogon of Mali	BCS	Biological Anthropology	08/01/2005	07/16/2007	Beverly Strassmann	MI	University of Michigan Ann Arbor	Standard Grant	Jean E. Turnquist	07/31/2008	$29,058.00		bis@umich.edu	3003 South State St. Room 1062	Ann Arbor	MI	481091274	7347636438	SBE	1392	0000, OTHR	$0.00	Kinship is a universal feature of human social life and, in the United States, genealogy is the second most popular hobby. Yet despite this fascination with kinship, a fundamental mystery has been neglected: Do people adopt kinship practices that serve the interests of their genes? Or does culture define kinship practices causing genetic underpinnings to become obscured? This study will explore the congruence between the cultural and genetic spheres of kinship and, in so doing, shed light on the broader relationship between biology and culture. It is a collaborative venture that combines the expertise of a human population geneticist with that of an anthropologist. This interdisciplinary research will introduce state of the art molecular technology to ethnographic field studies and provide a rich ethnographic data set to permit new questions to be asked using genetic sequence data. The study focuses on the Dogon, a traditional millet farming people of Mali, West Africa. The Dogon are ideal for this research because they employ a variety of cultural practices that appear to be reproductively motivated. This research will test the hypothesis that these cultural rules serve the genetic interests of those who enforce them and that they lead to a close mapping of culture onto biology. The study will also test alternative hypotheses about the basis for human cooperation. This objective is significant because it will be one of the first analyses of helping behavior in a human population that uses data on genetic relatedness from DNA sequencing. <br/>The broader impacts of the study include the training of American and Malian students in genetic techniques and quantitative fieldwork methods. Medical residents will gain experience in a developing country and share their expertise with a rural African health facility. The results will be disseminated in scientific journals, genetic databases, and a specialized monograph.
